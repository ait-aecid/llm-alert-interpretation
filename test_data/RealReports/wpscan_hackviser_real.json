WPScan is a security scanner designed to test the security of websites built with WordPress. This ruby programming language development product is intended for use by WordPress Administrators and Security Teams who need to find out the security status of their WordPress installations. It is used for scanning WordPress websites against known vulnerabilities in WordPress itself and its generally applied themes and plugins.\n\nHere are the primary uses of WPScan:\n\n    Username enumeration: Enumeration attacks, by themselves, are a means of trying to determine whether the target exists on the target system. The threat actor is trying to find out which users are present on a website. This information can be used as auxiliary information for different attack vectors. In a user enumeration attack, the threat actor will identify variations in how WordPress responds to certain requests. From this response, the attacker can determine whether the user exists or not.\n\n    Version detection: WPScan can detect target system's versions of WordPress core, plugins, and themes.\n\n    Publicly accessible sensitive data: WPScan can check for publicly accessible wp-config.php(The wp-config.php file is considered the 'heart' of a WordPress site. This file contains your database connection information, security keys and other critical settings.) backups and other database exports.\n\n    Password cracking: WPScan also has a password cracker. This can help you check if your website has weak authentication credentials. You need to provide WPScan with a password dictionary of your choice. This feature allows cybersecurity experts or researchers to specify a dictionary of words specific to the target system for a more focused test.\n\nCore Features\n\n    Vulnerability Scanning\n    Configuration File Backup Detection\n    User Enumeration\n    Brute Force Protection\n    Banner Grabbing\n    Plugin and Theme Detection\n    WordPress Version Detection\n\nData sources:\n\n    Vulnerability Database\n    WordPress Plugin and Theme Repositories\n    Online Resources\n    Target Website\n\nCommon WPScan Commands\n\n1. Basic Usage\n\n    This is a basic scanning command on a target WordPress site. It tries to pentest the attack vectors of the website by finding possible vulnerabilities and gathering information about the target system.\n\nwpscan --url http:\\/\\/example.com\n\n2. Enumerating Plugins\n\n    This command is used to list the installed plugins on the target WordPress site. Some WordPress plugins may contain security vulnerabilities, and knowing which plugins are in use can make known vulnerabilities associated with that plugin more obvious.\n\nwpscan --url http:\\/\\/example.com --enumerate p\n\n3. Enumerating Themes\n\n    This command lists the themes installed on the target WordPress site. This command is critical for identifying themes that do not contain some security updates. It is essential for assessing the security of a site's appearance, as outdated or vulnerable themes can also allow security risks.\n\nwpscan --url http:\\/\\/example.com --enumerate t\n\n4. Enumerating Users\n\n    This command lists the registered users on the target WordPress site. Knowledge of the user base is an advantage against security vulnerabilities such as CSRF, and can identify potential attack vectors related to weak or compromised accounts.\n\nwpscan --url http:\\/\\/example.com --enumerate u\n\n5. Checking for Vulnerabilities\n\n    This passive and aggressive detection command detects plugins and identifies known vulnerabilities. It highlights vulnerabilities in installed plugins by analyzing installed plugins against existing databases containing information about vulnerabilities.\n\nwpscan --url http:\\/\\/example.com --plugins-detection mixed\n\n6. Using an API Token\n\n    This option allows the user to use an API token for advanced scanning features, such as performing a scan using the latest vulnerability data. The API token provides access to WPScan's vast vulnerability database, allowing for more complete and accurate results.\n\nwpscan --url http:\\/\\/example.com --api-token YOUR_API_TOKEN\n\n7. Outputting Results to a File\n\n    This option allows an output file to be specified for the results obtained from the scan. This feature will therefore be important for record keeping, further analysis or reporting purposes and will allow users to keep a permanent record of the findings. This command facilitates the integration of WPScan outputs with other security tools, making the WPScan tool user-friendly.\n\nwpscan --url http:\\/\\/example.com -o output.txt\n\n8. Verbose output\n\n    This provides detailed output for the scan, where you can view a lot of information for the target system regarding the scan process, including actions performed and vulnerabilities discovered.\n\nwpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --verbose\n\n9. Help and Usage Information\n\n    This command displays help information, including a list of available options and commands for using WPScan.\n\nwpscan -h\n\nAlternative usage:\n\nwpscan --help\n\nOutput Examples of WPScan Commands\n\nCommand\tExample Usage\tFunction\tOutput Example\nBasic Usage\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com\tInitiates a basic scan of the specified WordPress site.\tCrawling https:\\/\\/example.com...\nDisplay Help\twpscan --help\tDisplays help information and available commands.\tUsage: wpscan [options]\nDisplay Version\twpscan --version\tDisplays the current version of WPScan installed.\tWPScan version 3.8.0\nUpdate WPScan\twpscan --update\tUpdates the WPScan tool to the latest version.\tWPScan updated to the latest version.\nUsing an API Token\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --api-token YOUR_API_TOKEN\tAllows enhanced features with an API token.\tUsing API token for enhanced data...\nEnumerate All Available Options\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --enumerate ap,at,au\tEnumerates all available options, including plugins, themes, and users.\tEnumerating all available options...\nEnumerate Plugins\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --enumerate p\tEnumerates installed plugins on the target site.\tEnumerating plugins...\nEnumerate Themes\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --enumerate t\tEnumerates installed themes on the target site.\tEnumerating themes...\nEnumerate Users\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --enumerate u\tEnumerates users registered on the target WordPress site.\tEnumerating users...\nCheck for Vulnerabilities\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --plugins-detection mixed\tChecks for known vulnerabilities in detected plugins.\tScanning for vulnerabilities...\nCheck for Specific Vulnerabilities\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --vulnerable\tChecks for specific vulnerabilities listed in the database.\tChecking for known vulnerabilities...\nBrute Force Enumeration\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --brute --wordlist wordlist.txt\tUses brute force to discover usernames or passwords.\tBrute forcing usernames...\nUse Proxy\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --proxy http:\\/\\/proxy.example.com\tUses a specified proxy for requests.\tUsing proxy: http:\\/\\/proxy.example.com\nCustom User-Agent\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --user-agent 'CustomUserAgent'\tSets a custom User-Agent string for requests.\tUsing custom User-Agent: CustomUserAgent\nRate Limiting\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --rate-limit 5\tLimits the number of requests sent per second.\tRate limit set to 5 requests per second.\nOutput Results to a File\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com -o output.txt\tOutputs the scan results to a specified file.\tResults saved to output.txt\nOutput JSON\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --output-json\tOutputs results in JSON format.\tResults saved in JSON format.\nStore HTTP Responses\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --store-requests\tStores HTTP requests and responses during the scan.\tHTTP requests and responses stored.\nVerbose Mode\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --verbose\tEnables verbose output for detailed information.\tVerbose mode enabled.\nResume Scan\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --resume resume.cfg\tResumes a scan using a previous session configuration file.\tResuming scan from resume.cfg...\nExclude Specific Paths\twpscan --url https:\\/\\/example.com --exclude-path \\/wp-admin\tExcludes specified paths from the scan.\tExcluding path: \\/wp-admin",
