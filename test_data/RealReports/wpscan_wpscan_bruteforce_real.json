        "content": "WPScan Brute Force\nPassword Brute Force\nPassword brute forcing is a common attack that hackers have used in the past against WordPress sites at scale. It’s common to see brute force attacks like this on WordPress sites.\nAttackers are looking for users, preferably administrators, with weak passwords to be able to login to WordPress and compromise the site. Depending on the compromised user role, once logged in, the attacker could escalate privileges by attacking other users, embed malicious code into the site or compromise the entire server.\nWeak Passwords\n\nHackers consolidate lists of compromised passwords into one large list with the most common passwords listed first. The original compromised passwords come from the many data breaches from various organisations. This increases the attacker’s chances as they are no longer guessing random passwords, but using real world data to create a list of the most probable real-world passwords.\n\nOne such password list contains the following top 10 passwords:\n\n1. 123456\n2. password\n3. 123456789\n4. 12345678\n5. 12345\n6. qwerty\n7. 123123\n8. 111111\n9. abc123\n10. 1234567\n\nIf you are using any of the passwords above, or anything similar to the above, you should change your password right away.\n\nWPScan Brute Force\n\nOne of the many features of the WPScan security scanner is password brute forcing. The WPScan CLI (Command Line Interface) tool can be used to iterate over a password list to try to guess a user’s password.\n\nTo launch a password brute force attack with WPScan CLI against a WordPress website, the command looks like this:\n\nwpscan --url http:\/\/test.local\/ --passwords passwords.txt\n\nWe pass WPScan the site URL with the --url parameter, and the password list, in this case named passwords.txt, with the --passwords parameter.\n\nIn our case, WPScan automatically found three valid WordPress users (admin, editor and author) and then started to cycle through our password list attempting to login as each of them. As you can see from the screenshot below, WPScan successfully guessed the admin user’s password, which was password.",
