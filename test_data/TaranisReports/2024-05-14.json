What\u2019s ahead for the rest of year?\nAt last week\u2019s RSA Conference, Ed Skoudis, the president of the SANS Technology Institute, convened his annual panel of SANS Institute instructors and fellows to dig into topics that should be top-of-mind for cyber defenders for the remaining months in the year.\n\"This is my favorite panel of the year because we get to hear from real experts about what's really going on in the wild and what we can do about it to make our organizations more safe and secure,\" Skoudis told attendees.\nUnsurprisingly, artificial intelligence (AI) was a recurring theme for almost all the threats identified by the panel. Here are the top 5 threats flagged by SANS experts that enterprises should be worried about in the remaining months of 2024.\nSecurity Impact of Technical Debt\nThe security cracks left behind by technical debt may not sound like a pressing new threat, but according to Dr. Johannes Ullrich, dean of research for SANS Technology Institute, the enterprise software stack is at an inflection point for cascading problems. What's more, \"It affects more and more not only just our enterprise applications, but also our security stack,\" he said.\nTechnical debt is the accumulation of work in software engineering or system design that's left undone or put off until 'tomorrow' for the sake of getting a minimum viable product up and running today. The debt may be accrued intentionally to optimize for speed or cost reasons, or it could build up unintentionally due to immature software engineering practices. Either way, it tends to raise a ton of cybersecurity risks as the debt grows.\nAnd according to Ullrich, the rising accrual of technical debt combined with the growing complexity of the software supply chain is increasing the profile of this threat vector.\n\"Even as a developer myself it is very easy to say 'hey, this new library doesn't really have any new features and doesn't fix any security vulnerabilities, so I'm not going to apply that update,\" he says. \"the problem is that five years from now after you skip 10 to 15 different incremental updates, then the big security vulnerability hits that library and now you have to work through all of these little quirks that have added up over the years so you can fix it.\"\nSynthetic Identity in the AI Age\nProving out identity at the initiation of new credentials and for authentication has been a decades long struggle for the security industry. That struggle will only continue to be amplified in the AI age, explained Ullrich.\nFake videos and fake audio are being used to impersonate people, Ullrich said, and they will foil many of the biometric authentication methods that have gained steam over the last decade. \"The game changer today is not the quality of these impersonation, the game changer is cost. It has become cheap to do this, whereas in the past it was pretty expensive. Now it is a couple dollars versus tens of thousands to create those fakes,\" he said.\nAI generated synthetic media is upending a lot of the innovations that security vendors have made to help reduce friction at registration and identity verification, as well as upon sign on. For example, a website called onlyfakes.com not only creates fake IDs, but also pictures that look like a photo you'd take of driver's license or other similar IDs to verify identity.\n\"It has a background like a carpet or a piece of wood that looks like someone took that picture in their home,\" Ullrich explained. \"And this has already been used to impersonate established identity online with some financial assistance.\"\nThis is going to put pressure in the near term on security practitioners and vendors to keep rethinking how the industry does risk-based identity verification, he warns.\nSextortion\nThe third top threat was a bit of a shocker compared to some of the other more enterprise-focused issues that SANS usually tackles but it is a serious one warranting attention from the industry, said Heather Mahalik Barnhart, a SANS faculty fellow and senior director of community engagement for Cellebrite.\n\"Each year I come up here and I try to just kind of wreck your brain in a different way and that's probably what this topic is going to do because it's an edgy threat that nobody wants to admit exists,\" she explained. \"It's sextortion and it is running wild and it is getting to be out of control.\"\nAccording to Barnhart, criminals are increasingly extorting online denizens with sexual pictures or videos, threatening them that they'll release them if the victim doesn't do what they ask of them. And in the era of highly convincing AI-generated images, those pictures or videos don't even need to be real to do the damage.\n\"The reality is it could be you. It could be me, it could be your children, it could be one of your coworkers,\" she says, explaining that sextortion is increasingly linked to teenage suicides, especially among boys aged 10 to 14.\nAnd it isn't just a personal threat. It could pose a very existential risk to the enterprise as well.\n\"Now think about this. If it's one of your coworkers, what does that mean for your organization? If an image is posed, whether it's AI or not, and they're saying, I'm going to put this on LinkedIn, it's going on your company's website, it's going to get blasted out on YouTube. It's going everywhere unless you provide me X,\" she says. \"People are going to consider providing X, and that's a scary thing.\"\nThat X could be money, or it could be cooperation in providing company access. The point being that as salacious and personal as it seems, sextortion is very relevant in enterprise context. Barnhart says that there's no easy answers for this growing threat, but that the first steps in combatting should definitely be rooted in awareness and training.\n\"Why don't we train on extortion? It doesn't have to be sexual in nature, but extortion in general,\" she says, explaining that just as enterprises expend a ton of money on anti-phising training, they should also consider investing in anti-extortion training.\nGenAI Election Threats\nAs we progress into the back half of 2024, the US election is going to increasingly gain the spotlight in online communities, social media sharing, and news coverage. As they dominate the headlines and the comment threads, fake media manipulation and other GenAI-generated election threats will be ever present across all of the major platforms, warns Terrence Williams, a SANS instructor and security engineer for AWS..\n\"You can thank 2024 for giving us the blessing of GenAI plus an election,\" Williams wryly joked. \"You know how well we handle those things, so we need to understand what we're coming up against right now.\"\nThe threat of deep fake media is no longer a future threat, it's a here-and-now threat, warned Williams. GenAI can now be used to generate custom campaign elements and to power automated robocall campaigns for legitimate reasons, but also for the sake of not just misleading voters but feeding them with outlandish fabrications. And that is only going to continue to deteriorate already tenuous trust in the election process. The answer to this is going to be collaboration among security researchers, academia, technology players and political stakeholders.\n\"Right now we have our academia looking to research, seeing how they could develop something that is detecting if an image or a video is AI generated,\" he said. Hopefully that is going to be available in time for tech companies who are doing the innovation to ensure that when they roll out their new solutions, there's going to be some type of safety net that we can rely on as citizens.\"\nHe says that it's up to public-private interests to make sure average voters understand that we're in an age of \"trust but verify,\" meaning that people need to be meticulous about the sources and the fact checking that they use. At the same time, innovators and politicians must also be held accountable for building safeguards into the technology and the processes that disseminate information, he said.\nOffensive AI as Threat Multiplier\nFinally, the fifth top threat was offensive AI as a multiplier of existing cyber threats, which was unpacked by Stephen Sims, a SANS fellow and longtime offensive security researcher. Offensive AI is the use of AI and automation by the bad guys to more quickly identify threats and to automate the generation of exploits and attack campaigns. As GenAI grows more sophisticated, even the most non-technical cyber attackers now have a more flexible arsenal of tools at their fingertips to quickly get malicious campaigns up and running.\n\"The speed at which we can now discover vulnerabilities and weaponize them is extremely fast and it's getting faster,\" Sims said.\nHe said his offensive security research has shown that GenAI is making it dead simple to automate patch 'diffing' or identifying changes across versions of binaries related to patches that will make it possible to reverse engineer exactly where a security fix has been made in order to exploit it on systems that haven't yet been patched. Similarly, GenAI can speed up weaponization of those patches, and combined with automation tools it is easy to do all of the \"technical stuff that would normally take us so long to do manually,\" Sims said.\n\"So, if you're a defender, this is the big takeaway: (you have to think about) how you're going to be able to defend against the speed that we're up against and the automation and the intelligence that's just going to get better and better,\" he said \"We can do the same style of automation on the defensive side.\"\nAbout the Author(s)\nEricka Chickowski specializes in coverage of information technology and business innovation.

However, this leads to an important issue. The motor can\u2019t directly mount to the case because you have to feel each one vibrating individually. A spring mounting system ensures that each motor only vibrates the tactile actuator it is supposed to. However, the system isn\u2019t perfect, and fast output is difficult to read due to the spread of vibrations.\nThe whole thing sits in a magnetic case and connects to the phone for power. The data is sent via Bluetooth (BLE, actually, in this version). The electronics are simple: just some basic motor drivers and an Arduino. Slowing them down might make the vibrations easier to manage, and that might be an idea for the next version.\nOverall, this seems like a good idea that maybe needs a bit of refinement.

But at least one of the publicly known bugs is poised for mass exploitation, and is indeed already in use by QakBot operators.\nThis month's disclosed flaws affect the gamut of the computing kahuna's portfolio, including Windows, Office, .NET Framework and Visual Studio; Microsoft Dynamics 365; Power BI; DHCP Server; Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based); and Windows Mobile Broadband. Only one of them is considered critical by Microsoft.\nIt should also be noted that the Chromium-based Edge browser is affected by CVE-2024-4761, a Chrome zero-day under active exploit that Google patched today, a critical sandbox escape bug that should be patched immediately.\nZero-Days Under Active Exploit\nTwo of the CVEs are listed as under active attack in the wild, while the third is simply already \"publicly known at the time of the release.\"\nPerhaps the most concerning is CVE-2024-30051 (7.2 CVSS), a Windows DWM Core Library elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerability that allows local attackers already on a network to escalate to system privileges. When chained with a code-execution bug for initial access, it can lead to complete takeover of a target and lateral movement \u2014 a common path used by ransomware actors.\nAnd indeed, Kaspersky researchers noted in a tandem blog today that multiple threat actors appear to have access to the exploit, which started circulating in April. Since then, adversaries using the popular QakBot initial-access Trojan in particular have co-opted the bug, they said. QakBot is an oft-seen partner in ransomware attacks.\n\"The speed with which threat actors are integrating this exploit into their arsenal underscores the importance of timely updates and vigilance in cybersecurity,\" said Boris Larin, principal security researcher at Kaspersky GReAT, in Kaspersky's blog.\nDustin Childs, head of threat initiative at Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), says the exploitation could soon snowball, so prioritizing this one is a must.\n\"Microsoft doesn't provide any indication of the volume of attacks, but the DWM Core bug appears to me to be more than a targeted attack,\" he noted in his Patch Tuesday breakdown today. \"Microsoft credits four different groups for reporting the bug, which indicates the attacks are widespread ... Don't wait to test and deploy this update; exploits will likely increase now that a patch is available to reverse engineer.\"\nThe other vulnerability that's under active exploit is a Windows MSHTML (Trident) Platform high-severity security feature bypass (CVE-2024-30040, CVSS 8.8) \u2014 and it should also be considered high priority for patching.\nThe MSHTML platform is a crucial component used for rendering HTML content in various applications, including Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office.\n\"This vulnerability stems from improper input validation (CWE-20), allowing attackers to circumvent Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) mitigations that protect against malicious COM/OLE controls,\" explained researchers at Action1, in their Patch Tuesday writeup.\nThey explained, \"Typically, users are deceived into interacting with malicious files, which might be delivered via email or instant messaging. The incorrect input validation means that the system fails to properly validate and sanitize input, allowing attackers to create documents that bypass MSHTML's OLE mitigations and execute arbitrary code upon user interaction.\"\nFurther, combining CVE-2024-30040 with an EoP vulnerability could allow attackers to also gain system or root privileges, implement persistence mechanisms, extract sensitive information from secured environments, and exploit additional vulnerabilities to move laterally within the network.\nThe third zero-day, which is not under active attack, is moderate-rated CVE-2024-30046 (CVSS 5.9), which exists in the ASP.NET Core and can lead to denial of service (DoS).\nCritical Bug Offers Bower of Info-Disclosure Vectors\nThe lone critical bug in this month's patch of vulnerabilities is CVE-2024-30043 (CVSS 8.8) in Microsoft SharePoint Server. The information-disclosure vulnerability is more specifically an XML external entity injection (XXE) bug, according to ZDI's Childs.\n\"An authenticated attacker could use this bug to read local files with SharePoint Farm service account user privileges,\" he explained. \"They could also perform an HTTP-based server-side request forgery (SSRF), and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 perform NLTM relaying as the SharePoint Farm service account. Bugs like this show why info disclosure vulnerabilities shouldn't be ignored or deprioritized.\"\nThat said, exploitation is not necessarily low-hanging fruit, noted Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable.\n\"While this vulnerability is also considered one of several vulnerabilities that are more likely to be exploited, exploitation requires an attacker to be authenticated to a vulnerable SharePoint Server with Site Owner permissions (or higher) first and to take additional steps in order to exploit this flaw,\" he said via email, \"which makes this flaw less likely to be widely exploited as most attackers follow the path of least resistance.\"\nOther Concerning Bugs to Prioritize\nResearchers also identified a handful of other bugs that admins should potentially prioritize in Microsoft's release.\nFirst up is CVE-2024-30033 (CVSS 7.0), an important-rated Windows Search Service EoP bug in the Windows Search Service that Automox security engineer Mat Lee said should be treated as critical.\n\"This flaw exists due to improper handling of permissions by the service, which could be exploited to perform unauthorized actions on the system,\" he explained in a blog post today. \"This specific vulnerability has the potential to pose a significant risk as it can be combined with other exploits to achieve privilege escalation. When a threat actor utilizes a combination of attacks, it has the potential to magnify the threat, where an attacker can do whatever they please on the system.\"\nThere's also CVE-2024-30018 (CVSS 7.8), an important-rated Windows Kernel EoP issue.\n\"The kernel manages hardware-software interactions and system resources, making it a potent target for attackers seeking to manipulate system operations to their advantage,\" explained Jason Kikta, CISO and senior vice president of product at Automox. \"By exploiting vulnerabilities within the kernel, an attacker can bypass security mechanisms, execute code with elevated privileges, and potentially take full control of the affected system.\"\nHe added, \"These vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous because they operate at a low level, often requiring immediate and prioritized patching to mitigate potential threats to system integrity and security.\"\nAnd finally, ZDI's Childs flagged CVE-2024-30050 (CVSS 5.4), a moderate-rated security bypass for Windows Mark of the Web.\n\"We don't normally detail moderate-rated bugs, but this type of security feature bypass is in vogue with ransomware gangs,\" he explained. \"They zip their payload to bypass network and host-based defenses. They use a Mark of the Web (MotW) bypass to evade SmartScreen or Protected View in Microsoft Office. While we have no indication this bug is being actively used, we see the technique used often enough to call it out. Bugs like this show why moderate-rated bugs shouldn't be ignored or deprioritized.\"\nAbout the Author(s)\nTara Seals has 20+ years of experience as a journalist, analyst and editor in the cybersecurity, communications and technology space.

We've got a lot of vendors joining this month's patchapalooza, which includes a handful of bugs that have been exploited \u2014 either in the wild or at Pwn2Own \u2014 and now fixed by Microsoft, Apple, Google and VMware.\nStarting with Microsoft: Redmond disclosed and fixed 60 Windows CVEs today including two listed as publicly known and exploited prior to the patch being issued.\nThe first one is an elevation of privilege bug in Windows DWM core library, tracked as CVE-2024-30051, that received a 7.8 CVSS rating. It allows an attacker to gain system privileges, so patch ASAP.\nWhile Microsoft doesn't provide any detail about the scale and scope of the exploit, it was spotted by several bug hunters, which indicates that it's pretty widespread. Redmond credits Kaspersky's Mert Degirmenci and Boris Larin, DBAPPSecurity WeBin Lab's Quan Jin and Guoxian Zhong, Google Threat Analysis Group's Vlad Stolyarov and Benoit Sevens, and Google Mandiant's Bryce Abdo and Adam Brunner with finding and reporting the vulnerability.\nAccording to the Kaspersky team, CVE-2024-30051 is being abused to deploy the Qakbot banking Trojan and other malware, and they \"believe that multiple threat actors have access to it.\"\nThe second that's listed as \"exploitation detected\" is tracked as CVE-2024-30040, and is a security feature bypass bug in Windows MSHTML that received an 8.8 CVSS score. Again, no details from Redmond about who is exploiting this vulnerability and to what scale.\nAccording to Microsoft, an attacker could abuse this flaw by first convincing a user into loading a malicious file \u2014 probably sent via email or instant messenger. After the file is opened, the attacker could exploit the bug to bypass OLE mitigations in Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office and then execute code.\nNHS Digital hints at exploit sightings of Arcserve UDP vulnerabilities\n-\nThe truth about KEV: CISA's vuln deadlines good influence on private-sector patching\n-\nPatch up \u2013 4 critical bugs in ArubaOS lead to remote code execution\n-\nOpen source programming language R patches gnarly arbitrary code exec flaw\n-\nOnly one of Microsoft's 60 bugs is deemed critical, earning an 8.8 CVSS rating, so let's move on to that one next. It's a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in SharePoint Server tracked as CVE-2024-30044. Zero Day Initiative researcher Piotr Bazyd\u0142o discovered and reported it to Microsoft, and it allows an unauthenticated attacker with site owner permission to inject and execute arbitrary code.\n\"They could also perform an HTTP-based server-side request forgery (SSRF), and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 perform NLTM relaying as the SharePoint Farm service account,\" warns ZDI's Dustin Childs. \"Bugs like this show why info disclosure vulnerabilities shouldn't be ignored or deprioritized.\"\nApple also under attack\nApple's got several bugs and fixes this month, with the \"most notable,\" according to Childs, being a patch for CVE-2024-23296 for iOS 16.7.8 and iPadOS 16.7.8. It's a memory corruption flaw in RTKit that could be abused to bypass kernel memory protections by an attacker with arbitrary kernel read and write capability.\n\"Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited,\" Cupertino noted, so go ahead and update this one soon, too.\nAlso this week: Apple patched a bug in Safari, tracked as CVE-2024-27834, that was exploited during Pwn2Own by Master of Pwn winner Manfred Paul.\nWait, another Chrome bug under exploit?\nGoogle pushed an update to fix a high-severity Chrome browser flaw, tracked as CVE-2024-4761, that has already been exploited by miscreants, according to the Chocolate Factory. It's a out-of-bounds write bug in V8 JavaScript engine, and in usual fashion Google doesn't provide any details about who is exploiting the CVE and for what nefarious purposes.\nIn addition to the emergency Chrome fix, Google released its usual monthly Android updates that patched 38 vulnerabilities. \"The most severe of these issues is a critical security vulnerability in the System component that could lead to local escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed,\" we're told.\nVMware Pwned\nThe virtualization giant updated VMware Workstation and Fusion software to patch four security vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-22267, CVE-2024-22268, CVE-2024-22269, CVE-2024-22270), the most serious of which is a use-after-free vulnerability (CVE-2024-22267) in both products that received a 9.3 CVSS rating.\n\"A malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may exploit this issue to execute code as the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host,\" VMware said.\nIt's worth noting that this flaw was also found and exploited during Pwn2Own by Gwangun Jung and Junoh Lee of Theori and STAR Labs SG.\nAdobe addresses 37 bugs\nAdobe issued eight patches for 37 bugs across its products, none of which are listed as publicly known of under exploit.\nThe update for Acrobat and Reader addresses 12 CVEs, nine of which are rated critical severity flaws. Adobe also patched three vulnerabilities in Illustrator, four in Substance 3D Painter, one in Aero and one in Substance 3D Designer.\nMeanwhile, the update for Adobe Animate fixes seven CVEs, and FrameMaker fixes eight.\nSAP secures critical CVEs\nSAP released seventeen new and updated patches, including two HotNews Notes and one High Priority Note.\nThe two HotNews Notes deserve top priority, according to Thomas Fritsch, SAP security researcher at Onapsis. These include security note #3455438, which received a 9.8 CVSS score and patches two critical vulnerabilities in SAP Customer Experience(CX) Commerce caused by external libraries used in SAP Commerce Cloud.\nSAP security note #3448171 addresses another critical flaw, this one receiving a 9.6 CVSS score. It patches a file upload vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP and ABAP Platform.\n\"The Onapsis Research Labs (ORL) detected that due to a missing signature check for two content repositories, an unauthenticated attacker can upload a malicious file to the server which when accessed by a victim can allow an attacker to completely compromise the system,\" Fritsch explained.\nLast but not least\u2026Intel\nAnd rounding out this month's patch party, Intel weighed in with a whopping 41 updates.\nOnly one of these security updates is deemed critical, and it fixes an escalation of privilege bug (CVE-2024-22476) in Intel Neural Compressor software before version 2.5.0 that could be exploited by an remote, unauthenticated user. It received a perfect 10 out of 10 CVSS rating, so start with this update.\nThe same product update also addresses a lesser flaw (CVE-2024-21792) with a medium, 4.7 CVSS rating. This one is a time-of-check time-of-use (TOC/TOU) race condition that could be exploited for information disclosure by an unauthenticated user with local access. \u00ae", "hash": "b8cdd2bca2e6f335581f0204a27bc0fb699f7edc200a8d386317956b977415aa", "id": "d05b3f7a-a98c-48c6-a2ab-efb744ca2171", "link": "https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2024/05/14/microsoft_may_patch_tuesday/", "osint_source_id": "a94d3f15-5689-470c-9d1f-670b8c63491d", "published": "2024-05-14T22:15:13", "source": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/headlines.atom", "story_id": "1389cbff-6eac-4f34-855d-f35d557f4ac5", "title": "Microsoft fixes a bug abused in QakBot attacks plus a second under exploit"}], "tags": {"Adam Brunner": {"name": "Adam Brunner", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Adobe": {"name": "Adobe", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Apple": {"name": "Apple", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Benoit Sevens": {"name": "Benoit Sevens", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Boris Larin": {"name": "Boris Larin", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Bryce Abdo": {"name": "Bryce Abdo", "tag_type": "PER"}, "CISA": {"name": "CISA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CVE-2024-21792": {"name": "CVE-2024-21792", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-22267": {"name": "CVE-2024-22267", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-22268": {"name": "CVE-2024-22268", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-22269": {"name": "CVE-2024-22269", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-22270": {"name": "CVE-2024-22270", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-22476": {"name": "CVE-2024-22476", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-23296": {"name": "CVE-2024-23296", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-27834": {"name": "CVE-2024-27834", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-30040": {"name": "CVE-2024-30040", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-30044": {"name": "CVE-2024-30044", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-30051": {"name": "CVE-2024-30051", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-4761": {"name": "CVE-2024-4761", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVEs": {"name": "CVEs", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Dustin Childs": {"name": "Dustin Childs", "tag_type": "PER"}, "FrameMaker": {"name": "FrameMaker", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Fritsch": {"name": "Fritsch", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Google": {"name": "Google", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Google Mandiant": {"name": "Google Mandiant", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Guoxian Zhong": {"name": "Guoxian Zhong", "tag_type": "PER"}, "HTTP-based": {"name": "HTTP-based", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Intel": {"name": "Intel", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Junoh Lee": {"name": "Junoh Lee", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Kaspersky": {"name": "Kaspersky", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Mert Degirmenci": {"name": "Mert Degirmenci", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Microsoft Office": {"name": "Microsoft Office", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "ORL": {"name": "ORL", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Onapsis": {"name": "Onapsis", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Onapsis Research Labs": {"name": "Onapsis Research Labs", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Piotr Bazyd\u0142o": {"name": "Piotr Bazyd\u0142o", "tag_type": "PER"}, "QakBot": {"name": "QakBot", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Quan Jin": {"name": "Quan Jin", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Redmond": {"name": "Redmond", "tag_type": "PER"}, "SAP": {"name": "SAP", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "SAP Customer Experience": {"name": "SAP Customer Experience", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Theori": {"name": "Theori", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Thomas Fritsch": {"name": "Thomas Fritsch", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Trojan": {"name": "Trojan", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "VMware": {"name": "VMware", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Vlad Stolyarov": {"name": "Vlad Stolyarov", "tag_type": "PER"}, "ZDI": {"name": "ZDI", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "Microsoft fixes a bug abused in QakBot attacks plus a second under exploit"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-15T01:14:53.395026", "id": "cb85d8fa-00ef-442a-b4f9-d56b4c7a3f13", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-14T22:12:00", "id": "eaa1d3e1-4b3f-4370-9246-22ccd43b929c", "news_items": [{"author": "Christof Windeck", "content": "Raspberry Pi 5: Der \"offizielle\" SSD-Adapter ist jetzt f\u00fcr 13 Euro lieferbar\nGut Ding will Weile haben: Die Raspi-Entwickler liefern endlich ihren hauseigenen NVMe-SSD-Adapter \"M.2 HAT+\" aus, auf den eine 2230- oder 2242-SSD passt.\nSchon bei der Vorstellung des Raspberry Pi 5 Ende September 2023 haben die Raspi-Macher einen SSD-Adapter angek\u00fcndigt.

To better understand Waymo's potential safety risks, NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is now looking into 22 incident reports involving cars equipped with Waymo's fifth-generation automated driving system. Seventeen incidents involved collisions, but none involved injuries.\nSome of the reports came directly from Waymo, while others \"were identified based on publicly available reports,\" NHTSA said. The reports document single-party crashes into \"stationary and semi-stationary objects such as gates and chains\" as well as instances in which Waymo cars \"appeared to disobey traffic safety control devices.\" The ODI plans to compare notes between incidents to decide if Waymo cars pose a safety risk or require updates to prevent malfunctioning. There is already evidence from the ODI's initial evaluation showing that Waymo's automated driving systems (ADS) were either \"engaged throughout the incident\" or abruptly \"disengaged in the moments just before an incident occurred,\" NHTSA said. The probe is the first step before NHTSA can issue a potential recall, Reuters reported. A Waymo spokesperson said the company currently serves \"over 50,000 weekly trips for our riders in some of the most challenging and complex environments.\" When a collision occurs, Waymo reviews each case and continually updates the ADS software to enhance performance.\n\"We are proud of our performance and safety record over tens of millions of autonomous miles driven, as well as our demonstrated commitment to safety transparency,\" Waymo's spokesperson said, confirming that Waymo would \"continue to work\" with the ODI to enhance ADS safety.\nSome of the reports came directly from Waymo, while others \"were identified based on publicly available reports,\" NHTSA said.

Was mit Digital ist halt schwierig, in diesem Neuland. Ich hatte es nach einem Leserhinweis der CDU gemeldet und binnen Stunden war der Server offline. Jetzt ist dieser NextCloud-Server wieder online und wohl auf aktuellem Stand.\nAnzeige\nOb wir (Tomas Jakobs und meine Wenigkeit) jetzt den gro\u00dfen Verdienst- oder M\u00fctterorden am Band in Blau bekommen?

Sowohl Tomas Jakobs als auch die CDU sind in dieser Causa Wiederholungst\u00e4ter. Denn Jakobs hatte die CDU bereits vor Jahren auf eine veraltete NextCloud-Instanz hingewiesen (siehe auch diesen Leserkommentar). Jetzt war also wieder eine total veraltete Software am Start und es gab schon Spekulationen, ob das nicht doch ein Honeypot f\u00fcr Hacker sein k\u00f6nne.\nReaktionen der Parteien\nLange Rede kurzer Sinn, ich hatte der CDU-Presseabteilung diesbez\u00fcglich des Sachverhalts eine E-Mail geschickt und auf den Blog-Beitrag hingewiesen \u2013 verbunden mit der M\u00f6glichkeit einer Stellungnahme. Da es im Beitrag auch um einen offenen Jitsi-Server von B\u00dcNDNIS 90/DIE Gr\u00fcnen ging, bekam deren Presseabteilung ebenfalls eine Mail von mir. Am Ende des Tages ergibt sich folgende Bilanz:\nB\u00dcNDNIS 90/DIE Gr\u00fcnen hat innerhalb der einger\u00e4umten Frist geantwortet und ich hatte ein Telefonat mit deren Pressesprecher. Ergebnis: Die betreiben wissentlich und willentlich die offene Jitsi-Instanz, haben aber andere Quellen f\u00fcr geschlossene Meetings.\n-\nDie CDU hat innerhalb der einger\u00e4umten Frist nicht geantwortet und bis heute \"toter Mann\" gespielt, aber reagiert. Kurz nach meiner Mail war der NextCloud-Server im Maintenance-Mode und damit funktional abgeschaltet.\n-\nJetzt hat mich Tomas Jakobs per Mail informiert (danke f\u00fcr den Hinweis), dass der CDU NextCloud-Server wieder online sei \u2013 dieses Mal mit aktueller NextCloud-Version. Die CDU betreibt unter *ttp://mycloud.cdu.de jetzt einen Nextcloud Server in der Version 29.0.0.19. Der Server erh\u00e4lt nun von scan.nextcloud.com ein A+ und einen aktuellen Patchstand bescheinigt.\nIch f\u00fcrchte, Tomas und meine Wenigkeit werden weiter auf den gro\u00dfen Verdienstorden warten m\u00fcssen.

Zu den zweiten Staffeln der Fantasy-Reihen gibt es nun jeweils einen ersten Trailer.\nDen Auftakt macht Staffel 2 von \"House of the Dragon\", die am 17. Juni ver\u00f6ffentlicht wird und in Deutschland beim Streaming-Anbieter Wow zu sehen sein wird. Der erste Trailer zeigt Szenen aus dem drakonischen B\u00fcrgerkrieg der Targaryens, der im Verlauf der ersten Staffel aufgebaut worden ist.\nEmpfohlener redaktioneller Inhalt\nMit Ihrer Zustimmmung wird hier ein externes YouTube-Video (Google Ireland Limited) geladen.\nIch bin damit einverstanden, dass mir externe Inhalte angezeigt werden.

Schon die ersten Staffeln der beiden Fantasy-Kolosse kamen fast gleichzeitig heraus: \"House of the Dragon\" wurde im August 2022 ver\u00f6ffentlicht, \"Ringe der Macht\" keine zwei Wochen sp\u00e4ter. Mit ihren zweiten Staffeln werden die beiden Serien also wieder in direkte Konkurrenz treten.\nWeitere Inhalte f\u00fcr Fans\nSowohl zum \"Game of Thrones\"- als auch zum \"Herr der Ringe\"-Universum sind weitere Inhalte in Arbeit: HBO arbeitet an der Serie \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight\", die ein Jahrhundert vor den Ereignissen aus \"Game of Thrones\" spielt. \"Hedge Knight\" dreht sich um den Ritter Duncan den Gro\u00dfen und seinen Knappen Aeg.\nAmazon hat sich f\u00fcr seine \"Ringe der Macht\"-Serie nur eingeschr\u00e4nkte Rechte an den Werken Tolkiens gesichert. An weiteren Filmen arbeitet derweil Warner Bros. Neben dem Anime \"The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim\" entsteht ein Film \u00fcber Gollum mit dem Titel \"The Hunt for Gollum\". Andy Serkis mimt dabei nicht nur erneut den Ex-Ringtr\u00e4ger, sondern f\u00fchrt auch Regie.\n(dahe)", "hash": "533b223cdb8e180df2e4547832a420b10b70ef67d9015d4b7777ff649426aca7", "id": "e47e8289-55f1-4c3d-a0a4-e1b9d2a737a0", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Zweite-Staffeln-von-Ringe-der-Macht-und-House-of-the-Dragon-im-Trailer-9718312.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-14T21:37:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "96a343fc-b3e2-4c96-8dca-111a59b066a4", "title": "Zweite Staffeln von \"Ringe der Macht\" und \"House of the Dragon\" im Trailer"}], "tags": {"Aeg": {"name": "Aeg", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Amazon": {"name": "Amazon", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Andy Serkis": {"name": "Andy Serkis", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Deutschland": {"name": "Deutschland", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Duncan": {"name": "Duncan", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Ireland": {"name": "Ireland", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Sauron": {"name": "Sauron", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Targaryens": {"name": "Targaryens", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Tolkiens": {"name": "Tolkiens", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Zweite Staffeln von \"Ringe der Macht\" und \"House of the Dragon\" im Trailer"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-15T01:12:16.705024", "id": "c40cc109-1912-4695-afc2-2ee2e4936cf0", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "3"}, {"created": "2024-05-15T01:11:29.193589", "id": "eaed4d99-d0c3-4ad6-8eba-529a7cbe1ffd", "key": "IOC_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-14T21:34:57", "id": "21bef0f7-cdfe-46ea-9423-42f3274114da", "news_items": [{"author": "Ahmet Umit Bayram", "content": "# Chyrp 2.5.2 -

US Federal Communications Commission has named its first robocall gang, dubbing the crew \"Royal Tiger,\" and detailed its operations in an attempt to encourage international action against the scammers.\nRoyal Tiger uses AI voice cloning to impersonate staff at government agencies, banks, and utilities. These robocalls purport to offer credit card interest rate reductions or fake purchase authorization orders. The gang also use spoofing techniques to obtain consumer's financial and other sensitive data, which then allows them to target individuals.\nBecause they didn't obtain consent from consumers, these calls violate the US Telephone Consumer Protection Act and/or Commission rules for robocalls to wireless telephone numbers, the FCC ruled.\nThe crew, comprised of individuals and voice service providers operating out of India, the UK, the United Arab Emirates and the USs, is led by an individual named as Prince Jashvantlal Anand and his associate Kaushal Bhavsar [PDF].\nAs with other robocall operations, Royal Tiger uses multiple companies and constantly shifting addresses to evade law enforcement, according to the agency .\nAnand uses the alias \"Frank Murphy,\" and has served as CEO of Illum Telecommunication and PZ Telecommunication, both of which are US-based companies operating on behalf of Royal Tiger, the FCC asserts. PZ Telecom maintains office locations in Anaheim, California, and Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.\nBhavsar is the CEO of One Eye, another one of the US-based companies linked to the robocall operation, and director of Illum Telecommunication. The FCC enforcement bureau sent both Illum and PZ Telecommunication a cease and desist letter in October 2021.\nIt sent a similar letter to One Eye in February 2023, demanding the VoIP business stop serving as a gateway provider for illegal traffic. Then in May 2023, the FCC required downstream providers to block One Eye's traffic.\nIn addition to the US-based companies, Royal Tiger's UK affiliates include PZ Telecommunications UK, which dissolved in October 2021, UK Tell and Opulix Digital. Two of these, Illum Telecommunication and Opulix Digital Private, are also registered in India.\nSorry, scammers: The FCC says AI robocalls are definitely illegal\n-\nRobocall scammers sentenced in US after netting $1.2M via India-based call centers\n-\nFTC sues VoIP provider over 'billions of illegal robocalls'\n-\nFCC calls for mega $300 million fine for massive US robocall campaign\n-\nIn addition to naming and shaming, the FCC also classified the Royal Tiger entities and individuals as a Consumer Communications Information Services Threat (C-CIST) because of the \"significant\" danger it poses to \"consumer trust in the integrity of communications information services.\" [PDF]\n\"As our investigative targets use more and more sophisticated and clandestine means such as generative AI voice-cloning technology and 'spoofing' to obtain sensitive data and defraud consumers, the C-CIST classification tool will allow us to better coordinate with our state, federal, and global regulatory and law enforcement partners to take on these bad actors,\" said Loyaan Egal, chief of the FCC enforcement bureau and chair of the Privacy and Data Protection Task Force in a statement [PDF].\n\"The C-CIST designation of Royal Tiger, and similar future designations, will assist industry stakeholders in better protecting their customers and their privacy,\" he added. \u00ae", "hash": "991de977898f33013764ac6ced3c9c62b023f2e8d766e37bde08134008f80d31", "id": "9bec4dc6-790a-4d79-b226-8d92c5d19faf", "link": "https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2024/05/14/fcc_royal_tiger_robocalls/", "osint_source_id": "a94d3f15-5689-470c-9d1f-670b8c63491d", "published": "2024-05-14T21:30:13", "source": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/headlines.atom", "story_id": "73ed8ab3-f6e2-4b39-ade6-8f1e38d34925", "title": "FCC names and shames Royal Tiger AI robocall crew"}], "tags": {"Anaheim": {"name": "Anaheim", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Anand": {"name": "Anand", "tag_type": "PER"}, "C-CIST": {"name": "C-CIST", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "California": {"name": "California", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Commission": {"name": "Commission", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "FCC": {"name": "FCC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "FTC": {"name": "FTC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Illum Telecommunication": {"name": "Illum Telecommunication", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "India": {"name": "India", "tag_type": "Country"}, "India-based": {"name": "India-based", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Jashvantlal Anand": {"name": "Jashvantlal Anand", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Kaushal Bhavsar": {"name": "Kaushal Bhavsar", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Loyaan Egal": {"name": "Loyaan Egal", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Maharashtra": {"name": "Maharashtra", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Mumbai": {"name": "Mumbai", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Opulix Digital": {"name": "Opulix Digital", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "PZ Telecom": {"name": "PZ Telecom", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Prince": {"name": "Prince", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Royal": {"name": "Royal", "tag_type": "APT"}, "Royal Tiger": {"name": "Royal Tiger", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "US-based": {"name": "US-based", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "USs": {"name": "USs", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "United Arab Emirates": {"name": "United Arab Emirates", "tag_type": "Country"}}, "title": "FCC names and shames Royal Tiger AI robocall crew"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-15T01:23:33.773647", "id": "09561f61-11bf-406c-ac0c-7847277f1720", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "8"}, {"created": "2024-05-15T01:12:43.728477", "id": "6f563d0a-57ab-4408-8aaf-f4d9e1e8eea9", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-14T21:30:00", "id": "eb04ede6-52fa-4a25-a9c0-c4646b016fa0", "news_items": [{"author": "msmash", "content": "Dublin To New York City Portal Temporarily Shut Down Due To Inappropriate Behavior (time.com) 37\nA portal linking New York City to Dublin via a livestream has been temporarily shut down after inappropriate behavior ensued, according to the Dublin City Council.

Alternatively, the portal had also been the site of reunions with old friends and even a proposal, with many documenting their experience with the installation online.\nThe Dublin City Council said that although those engaged in the inappropriate behavior were few and far between, videos of said behavior went viral online. \"While we cannot control all of these actions, we are implementing some technical solutions to address this and these will go live in the next 24 hours,\" the council said in a Monday statement. \"We will continue to monitor the situation over the coming days with our partners in New York to ensure that portals continue to deliver a positive experience for both cities and the world.\"\nThe Dublin City Council said that although those engaged in the inappropriate behavior were few and far between, videos of said behavior went viral online. \"While we cannot control all of these actions, we are implementing some technical solutions to address this and these will go live in the next 24 hours,\" the council said in a Monday statement. \"We will continue to monitor the situation over the coming days with our partners in New York to ensure that portals continue to deliver a positive experience for both cities and the world.\"\nShow me your tits!

Delivered daily or weekly right to your email inbox.\nUnprotected Session Tokens Can Undermine FIDO2 Security\nWhile the protocol has made passwordless authentication a reality, token-binding is key to prevent against token theft and reuse, security vendor says.\nJai Vijayan, Contributing Writer\nMay 14, 2024\n5 Min Read\nSource: FrankHH via Shutterstock\nMany organizations that have implemented passwordless authentication via the FIDO2 standard may be undermining some of the security benefits of the approach by not properly securing the sessions that take place after authentication happens.\nThat oversight gives adversaries an opening to use a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to try and steal session cookies and perform any action that a legitimately authenticated user would be able to perform, according to a new analysis by Silverfort.\nMaking Passwordless Authentication a Reality\nFIDO2 makes passwordless authentication a reality and is very phishing-resistant, says Dor Segal, security researcher at Silverfort. However, there are some instances where FIDO suggests it can protect against MITM when that is not always the case, he says.\n\"We're concerned that organizations will have a false sense of security that they are completely protected from a MITM attack if they use FIDO2,\" Segal says. While the authentication itself is protected, the session it enables is not. \"Many developers and engineers don't understand this nuance and would falsely trust they are protected against MITM when using FIDO.\"\nFIDO2 \u2014 or Fast Identity Online 2 \u2014 is an open authentication standard from the FIDO Alliance. It enables passwordless authentication by giving users options like biometrics, USB tokens, passkeys, and WebAuthn or the Web Authentication API to log into servers and websites. Most security experts consider it a very robust protocol for protecting against phishing and credential-theft related attacks.\nIn a FIDO2 setup, a user first registers with a FIDO2-supported online service and chooses an authentication mechanism, such as passkeys or a USB token. During the registration process the client device generates a public and private key pair exclusively for that application or Website.\nAs Microsoft explains it, \"The public key is encrypted and shared with the service, but the private key remains securely on the user's device.\" When a user attempts to sign-in to the service \u2014 or relying party in FIDO-speak \u2014 the service presents a unique challenge to the client device, which then responds to it, signs the response with the private key, and returns it. The goal is to cryptographically protect the whole authentication process in a manner resistant to phishing attacks.\nUnprotected Session Tokens\nThe problem, according to Silverfort, is what often happens next. \"Most applications do not protect the session tokens created after authentication is successful.\" And often during Web authentication there is no validation of the device that requested the session. This gives an MITM attacker a way to steal session tokens, impersonate the victim, and gain access to all the applications that the user has access to via single sign-on (SSO), Segal says.\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) mechanisms have made MITM attacks more difficult to accomplish, Silvefort said. Even so, attackers can use methods like DNS/DHCP spoofing, Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning, and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) to secure an MITM position on a network. \"While MITM attacks are harder these days because most browsers use TLS, it is still possible to perform a MITM attack,\" Segal says. \"An adversary can spoof, downgrade traffic, or use a vulnerability to secure a MITM attack.\"\nOnce an adversary has gained MITM status on a network they would need to wait and watch for the victim to use SSO to connect to a FIDO2 protected Web application. If the subsequent session is not protected, the adversary can steal tokens, perform session hijacking, and impersonate the victim. \"We tested Yubico, EntraID, and Ping and in every case, we saw that FIDO2 did a great job securing the authentication, and the SSO provider,\" Segal says. \"However, it did not prevent an attacker from stealing the session tokens, leaving the Web application vulnerable.\"\nA Known Issue?\nMike Kiser, director of strategy and standards at SailPoint, says the issues that Silverfort has identified are well understood and exist with or without FIDO2. \"You're not 'bypassing' FIDO2 in this case,\" Kiser says. \"It's still doing the job that [it is meant for]: preventing the theft of credentials and/or their replay against the same relying party.\"\nAlso, achieving a MITM position on a target network requires considerably more effort in a FIDO2 environment, than it would take otherwise, Kiser says. He advises that organizations continue to use the identity security measures they already have in place; safeguard trusted certificate stores; implement security best practices; and continue to trust FIDO2.\nJason Soroko, senior vice president of product at Sectigo, says the Silverfort report highlights the fact that while FIDO2 itself relies on a strong asymmetric secret, the SSO implementations built around it mostly rely on a much less secure symmetric secret, such as a session token. \"The main takeaway from this report is that we need to re-examine the idea of token binding and ensure that implementations of FIDO2 are not relying on a weak foundation,\" he says.\nToken binding is a security mechanism for strengthening the security of authentication tokens. The goal is to prevent token theft and replay by cryptographically binding an authentication token to the underlying TLS connection.\nOrganizations using FIDO2 to secure their SSO authentication should consider changing the default setting, and turning on token-binding when possible, Segal says. \"In many cases, it is developers implementing SSO who aren't as security savvy and don't even know this option exists,\" he says. \"So we're trying to raise awareness around the importance of not only securing the authentication, but also the session that takes place once the authentication is done.\"\nAbout the Author(s)\nJai Vijayan is a seasoned technology reporter with over 20 years of experience in IT trade journalism.

"news_items": [{"author": "Abhishjain", "content": "HDInsight on AKS is a managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) that runs on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). HDInsight on AKS allows you to deploy popular Open-Source Analytics workloads like Apache Spark\u2122, Apache Flink:registered:, and Trino without the overhead of managing and monitoring containers.\nHDInsight on AKS clusters allow you to setup outbound network connections from cluster to any destination, if the destination is reachable from the node's network interface. This means that cluster resources can access any public or private IP address, domain name, or URL on the internet or on your virtual network.However, in some scenarios, you may want to control or restrict the egress traffic from your cluster for security, compliance reasons. For example, you may want to:\n \n\nPrevent clusters from accessing malicious or unwanted services.\nEnforce network policies or firewall rules on the outbound traffic.\nMonitor or audit the egress traffic from cluster for troubleshooting or compliance purposes.\n\n \nThere are different methods for managing the traffic flow. You can learn more about it here.\nIn this blog, we will discuss about how to control or restrict the egress traffic from your HDInsight on AKS cluster using User Defined Routing (UDR) in your virtual network.\n \nWith this setup, there won't be any Public IP created when you spin up an HDInsight on AKS cluster.Note: UDR setup requires you to setup firewall rules and define the routing using custom VNet and subnet before creating an HDInsight on AKS clusterLet's get started. Step 1: Setup the virtual network (VNet). Required if you don't have existing VNet\n \n\nFrom the Azure portal, search for virtual networks and click to create new.\n Create a VNet named \"contoso-hdi-vnet\".\n \n\n\nStep 2: Setup the firewall. Deploy the firewall in your virtual network (contoso-hdi-vnet).To deploy a firewall into the integrated virtual network, you need a subnet called AzureFirewallSubnet \n\nNavigate to your VNet (contoso-hdi-vnet) and go to subnets\nAdd subnet with subnet purpose as \"Azure Firewall\"\n\nNow, go to Firewall tab and click to add a new Firewall\n2. Create a firewall named \"contoso-hdi-firewall\" with the following details\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\nResource group\n\n\nSame resource group as the integrated virtual network.\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\n\"contoso-hdi-firewall\" or Name of your choice \n\n\n\n\nRegion\n\n\nSame region as the integrated virtual network.\n\n\n\n\nFirewall policy\n\n\nCreate one by selecting Add new.\n\n\n\n\nVirtual network\n\n\nSelect the integrated virtual network.\n\n\n\n\nPublic IP address\n\n\nSelect an existing address or create one by selecting Add new.\n\n\n\n\n3. Once deployment is complete, go to Overview page of newly created firewall, copy private IP address. The private IP address will be used as next hop address in the routing rule for the virtual network.\n\nStep 3: Create a Route table and associate it with your virtual network to route all traffic to the firewallWhen you create a virtual network, Azure automatically creates a default route table for each of its subnets and adds system\u00a0default routes to the table. In this step, you create a user-defined route table that routes all traffic to the firewall, and then associate it with the App Service subnet in the integrated virtual network.\n\u00a0\n\nFrom the Azure portal, search for \"Route tables\" and select Route tables resource\n\u00a0\n\nCreate a route table with name \"contoso-hdi-route-table\".\u00a0Note: Region should be same as Firewall region For e.g. \"East US 2\" in this case\n\u00a0\n\nGo to the newly create route table and add a route with the following details\n\n\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\nDestination Type\n\n\nIP Addresses\n\n\n\n\nDestination IP addresses/CIDR ranges\n\n\n0.0.0.0/0\n\n\n\n\nNext hop type\n\n\nVirtual appliance\n\n\n\n\nNext hop address\n\n\nThe private IP address for the firewall that you copied\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to subnets and associate the subnet you want to use during HDInsight on AKS cluster setup. Here, \"default\" subnet is used.\n\nStep 4: Configure Firewall policies\n\n\nNavigate to the firewall's overview page and select its firewall policy.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdd network rules (defined here) with the subnet (To be used for setting up HDInsight on AKS cluster) as the source address\n\u00a0\n\nAdd application rules (defined here) with the subnet (To be used for setting up HDInsight on AKS cluster) as the source address\nDepending on the cluster type (Spark, Flink, Trino), you need to add additional network and application rules defined here.\n\u00a0\n\n\nStep 5:\u00a0Setup HDInsight on AKS cluster pool\n\nFrom the Azure portal, search \"HDInsight on AKS clusters pool\" and create a new HDInsight on AKS cluster pool\nUnder Security + network settings, choose the virtual network (contoso-hdi-vnet), Subnet (default) and Egress path (Outbound with userDefinedRouting)\n\u00a0\n\nOnce cluster pool is created, verify that no public IP is created. Search for MC_hdi-<clusterpool deployment id> resource group\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStep 6:\u00a0Add AKS API Server Address to the network rules in the firewall policy\n\u00a0\n\nFrom the Azure portal, search for cluster pool name (contoso-hdi-udr-pool) and go the corresponding kubernetes resource.\n\u00a0\n\nFrom the overview tab, copy the API server address\nNavigate to the contoso-hdi-firewall-policy and enable DNS proxy from DNS tab\n\u00a0\n\nGo to Network rules tab and add a new rule\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nStep 7: Assign\u00a0the AKS cluster - that matches the cluster pool - Network Contributor\u00a0role on your network resources that are used for defining the routing, such as Virtual Network, Route table, and NSG (if used).\n\u00a0\n\nNavigate to your VNet (contoso-hdi-vnet), go to Access control and click on \"Add role assignment\n\u00a0\n\nSelect \"Network Contributor\" role and member as \"Managed identity\". In Managed identity option, select Kubernetes services and select your cluster pool name\n\u00a0\n\nClick Review+ create to complete the role assignment\n\n\u00a0\nStep 8: Create HDInsight on AKS cluster\n\nFrom Azure portal, search for \"HDInsight on AKS cluster\" service or click + New cluster from the overview tab of the cluster pool\n\u00a0\n\nSelect the cluster pool (contoso-hdi-udr-pool), cluster type (Trino) and click \"Review + create\"\n\n\n\nStep 9: Access the cluster via a client such as virtual machine (VM)\n\u00a0\n\nCreate a windows virtual machine and copy the public IP of the VM\n\u00a0\n\nNavigate to the route table (contoso-hdi-route-table) and add VM IP to the route table\n\u00a0\n\nRemote login to the VM and you can access the cluster web urls\n\n\u00a0\nWith Private AKS clusters, and outbound UDR setup, enterprise customers can ensure that their sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access, and theft. They\u00a0can continue to implement a range of security measures to protect their data driven applications. With the ability to perform regular security updates and patches to keep their systems up-to-date and secure with In-place upgrades.\n\u00a0\nWith all of this available, enterprise customers can now\u00a0comply with industry-specific regulations related to data privacy, security, and compliance and reduce the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.\n\u00a0", "hash": "043c90c4cb292cd1de7d87c3e32b48332e2bf4316801ffd888f4d20f26f99d70", "id": "408b681c-3287-4c48-b9a8-e73081bc1271", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/analytics-on-azure-blog/getting-started-with-private-clusters-on-hdinsight-on-aks-for/ba-p/4138624", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-14T21:05:31", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "d7bd7d22-fd25-43b6-a6d1-d46519f7c994", "title": "Getting started with Private Clusters on HDInsight on AKS for securing your analytics workloads"}], "tags": {"0.0.0.0/0": {"name": "0.0.0.0/0", "tag_type": "ipv4_cidrs"}, "AKS": {"name": "AKS", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "AzureFirewallSubnet": {"name": "AzureFirewallSubnet", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Firewall": {"name": "Firewall", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "HDInsight": {"name": "HDInsight", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "In-place": {"name": "In-place", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Kubernetes": {"name": "Kubernetes", "tag_type": "PER"}, "PaaS": {"name": "PaaS", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "UDR": {"name": "UDR", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "User Defined Routing": {"name": "User Defined Routing", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Getting started with Private Clusters on HDInsight on AKS for securing your analytics workloads"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-15T01:14:48.763108", "id": "2dc10bd0-2d5c-4555-86ae-ce3d5ded2ca0", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "105"}, {"created": "2024-05-15T01:11:57.343555", "id": "44e010dc-ae5a-4c77-bc8c-6c2ee8e874a6", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "103"}], "created": "2024-05-14T20:58:55", "id": "9e134a55-5573-4e6c-a1cd-d50214f2b921", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "SHOP\nSUPPORT\nPC\nData Center\nMobile: Lenovo\nMobile: Motorola\nSmart\nService Parts\nThis will take you to the Lenovo Support Community where you can interact with our forums to get additional assistance.

"AI in Gmail Will Sift Through Emails, Provide Search Summaries, Send Emails (arstechnica.com) 32\nAn anonymous reader shares a report: Google's Gemini AI often just feels like a chatbot built into a text-input field, but you can really start to do special things when you give it access to a ton of data. Gemini in Gmail will soon be able to search through your entire backlog of emails and show a summary in a sidebar. That's simple to describe but solves a huge problem with email: even searching brings up a list of email subjects, and you have to click-through to each one just to read it.\nHaving an AI sift through a bunch of emails and provide a summary sounds like a huge time saver and something you can't do with any other interface. Google's one-minute demo of this feature showed a big blue Gemini button at the top right of the Gmail web app. Tapping it opens the normal chatbot sidebar you can type in. Asking for a summary of emails from a certain contact will get you a bullet-point list of what has been happening, with a list of \"sources\" at the bottom that will jump you right to a certain email. In the last second of the demo, the user types, \"Reply saying I want to volunteer for the parent's group event,\" hits \"enter,\" and then the chatbot instantly, without confirmation, sends an email.\nHaving an AI sift through a bunch of emails and provide a summary sounds like a huge time saver and something you can't do with any other interface.

But newly proposed legislation could change that -- and have major implications for tech companies themselves.\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) and Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) this week unveiled new, bipartisan legislation that could end the protections afforded tech companies under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal accompanying their legislation, the lawmakers said that while Section 230 had been enacted to allow for the internet's growth, tech companies have since used it to avoid liability in protecting their users.\nAlso: The FCC restores net neutrality - here's what it means for the internet\n\"Unfortunately, Section 230 is now poisoning the healthy online ecosystem it once fostered. Big Tech companies are exploiting the law to shield them from any responsibility or accountability as their platforms inflict immense harm on Americans, especially children,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Congress's failure to revisit this law is irresponsible and untenable. That is why we're taking bipartisan action.\"\nThe proposed legislation would allow for Section 230 to remain in place, as is, for 18 months. During that period, tech companies and Congress would need to work together to \"enact a new legal framework\" that would still allow for free expression on the internet while requiring the companies \"to be good stewards of their platforms.\"\nAs nebulous as that goal may appear, the lawmakers suggest that a collaborative effort between Big Tech and Congress would ultimately make for a better and more accountable internet.\nWhat is Section 230?\nSection 230 was passed into law in 1996 to protect tech companies from legal liability if users published offensive or otherwise harmful content on their platforms. In practice, the law enabled tech companies to moderate content on their platforms and decide for themselves which content should and shouldn't be allowed. Critically, and regardless of whether they removed content, the companies couldn't be sued for what users posted.\nWhile that regulation was critical to allowing tech companies to grow, it also has paved the way for some companies -- Meta and Google, among others -- to achieve massive scale. If these tech giants were liable for anything users posted to their platforms, they would first need to take on the Herculean task of moderating all content before it's published and ensure it isn't offensive -- or face the wrath of lawsuits.\nAlso: China plans to disrupt US elections using AI-generated content, Microsoft claims\nIn recent years, Section 230 has come under increased scrutiny by detractors who charge that tech companies have grown too big, that they're not doing enough to safeguard users, including children, and that they should be held liable for content published on their platforms. Supporters of the Section 230 repeal also argue that smaller tech companies would benefit from a law change because Section 230 has fueled Big Tech's growth and helped it consolidate power on the internet.\nOf course, Big Tech has rejected those claims. For years, the biggest tech companies have argued that Section 230 enables free expression on the internet, allowing their users to say what they truly feel or believe without facing undue moderation. These companies, along with some lawmakers, also have argued that their current scale would enable them to absorb lawsuits if Section 230 is repealed. Smaller startups with fewer resources, however, could buckle under the pressure of moderation and subsequent lawsuits.\nDespite some lawmaker support, Section 230 is on decidedly shaky ground. The bill proposed this week indeed has bipartisan support -- a difficult task in today's US Congress -- and President Joe Biden has indicated that he would be open to signing a bill repealing Section 230.\nAlso: Cybersecurity 101: Everything on how to protect your privacy and stay safe online\nWhat happens to users if Section 230 is repealed?\nThe real question looking forward, however, centers on what happens next. While the newly proposed legislation has support from both Republicans and Democrats, there's no guarantee it'll pass through the House and Senate and ultimately land on the President's desk. Even if it does, there's no telling how the legislation can change over time as lawmakers get their hands on it.\nIf Section 230 is repealed, users could be affected in a variety of ways. For one, a direct repeal of Section 330 with no replacement would immediately require tech companies to aggressively moderate all content published on their platforms, meaning users could see some of their content removed. And while it could help smaller tech companies with new ideas on how to build online communities, it's not beyond the realm of possibility that some of those startups will indeed buckle under moderation and lawsuit pressure.\nPerhaps that's one reason Big Tech has been so aggressive in lobbying Washington. According to Issue One, which reviewed lobbying records, Meta, TikTok parent ByteDance, X, Snap, and Discord combined to spend $30 million on lobbying last year alone, a 12 percent increase compared to 2022. In total, the companies hired 142 lobbyists last year, according to the report. While the Issue One report stopped short of saying exactly what the lobbyists did for the companies, Section 230's repeal may have been one of the issues on the table.\nAlso: All eyes on cyberdefense as elections enter the generative AI era\nThe most likely scenario, however, and one that Reps. Rogers and Pallone promoted in their recent legislation, would see Big Tech and Congress come together on new legislation that wouldn't entirely repeal Section 230. Instead, that legislation would provide some protections for the platforms and free speech, but perhaps make them more accountable for removing certain kinds of content.\n\"Our bill gives Big Tech a choice,\" the lawmakers wrote in their op-ed. \"Work with Congress to ensure the internet is a safe, healthy place for good, or lose Section 230 protections entirely.\"\nBut don't be surprised if Section 230 comes under ever-increasing pressure and for lawmakers and tech companies to find some sort of middle ground in the not-so-distant future.", "hash": "03065ae978760a7a03065a2c160a10705ecdc3a0edf6e49f7c48740c119ebf52", "id": "140cd7eb-b839-4565-92bf-ca75f7aed91b", "link": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/lawmakers-to-big-tech-work-together-to-make-the-internet-safer-or-face-repeal-of-section-230/%23ftag=RSSbaffb68", "osint_source_id": "ed5d2c82-3035-490c-af95-5844977f7f3d", "published": "2024-05-14T20:34:00", "source": "https://www.zdnet.com/topic/security/rss.xml", "story_id": "e7e8e850-1f5f-4183-810e-611c54723438", "title": "Lawmakers' Section 230 ultimatum to Big Tech: Work together to make the internet safer, or else"}], "tags": {"Americans": {"name": "Americans", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "China": {"name": "China", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Congress": {"name": "Congress", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "D-NJ": {"name": "D-NJ", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Democrats": {"name": "Democrats", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Discord": {"name": "Discord", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "FCC": {"name": "FCC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Frank Pallone": {"name": "Frank Pallone", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Herculean": {"name": "Herculean", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "House": {"name": "House", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Joe Biden": {"name": "Joe Biden", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "R-WA": {"name": "R-WA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Republicans": {"name": "Republicans", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Rogers": {"name": "Rogers", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Section 230": {"name": "Section 230", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Section 330": {"name": "Section 330", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Senate": {"name": "Senate", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Snap": {"name": "Snap", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "TikTok": {"name": "TikTok", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "US Congress": {"name": "US Congress", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Washington": {"name": "Washington", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "ZDNet": {"name": "ZDNet", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "Lawmakers' Section 230 ultimatum to Big Tech: Work together to make the internet safer, or else"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-15T01:11:59.318574", "id": "b95b7a20-d3e0-432e-9c10-53aa1711af5f", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "103"}, {"created": "2024-05-15T01:15:22.616688", "id": "bcbd000e-fed8-4627-a589-5b03770d5242", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "105"}], "created": "2024-05-14T20:25:40", "id": "c4e6e5ee-e41f-4b07-8e16-4f97b3047f63", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "SHOP\nSUPPORT\nPC\nData Center\nMobile: Lenovo\nMobile: Motorola\nSmart\nService Parts\nThis will take you to the Lenovo Support Community where you can interact with our forums to get additional assistance.

state cyber actors, US warns\nRussia, China, Iran and North Korea are increasingly targeting civil society organizations across the world, according to U.S. cybersecurity agencies.\nIn an advisory released on Tuesday, the FBI, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) warned that nation-state hacking operations have set their sights on nongovernmental organizations, think tanks, human rights activists and journalists. Cybersecurity agencies in Japan, Estonia, Canada, the U.K., and Finland also contributed to the report.\nCivil society organizations and their staff \u201care at high threat of being targeted by malicious cyber actors\u201d who \u201cseek to undermine democratic values.\u201d The organizations also generally have low defense capacity because they \u201clack internal IT support and essential cyber hygiene to prevent the possibility of malicious activity (e.g., lifecycle management, patch management, multifactor authentication, password management).\u201d\nMany journalists and dissidents are forced to rely on \u201cinsecure channels for communication and need to manage public profiles to advance their work\u201d \u2014 exposing them to common threats like social engineering.\nThe goal of most government hacking groups is intimidation, harassment, coercion, and surveillance, according to the agencies. State-sponsored actors use a variety of tactics to gain initial access and then \u201coften install spyware on the compromised devices to conduct more extensive surveillance, such as location tracking and access to files.\u201d\nUsing cybersecurity industry monikers, the advisory specifically names North Korea\u2019s Velvet Chollima; China\u2019s Mustang Panda and Earth Empusa; Iran\u2019s Charming Kitten, and the Syrian Electronic Army as government-backed groups specifically targeting a mix of aid organizations, religious institutions, dissidents and others.\nIn addition to the groups named, research \u201csuggests that numerous other countries also leverage digital transnational repression tactics, focusing on punishing and silencing dissenters.\u201d\n\u201cState-sponsored actors seek to undermine fundamental democratic and humanitarian values and interests supported by civil society organizations and individuals,\u201d CISA director Jen Easterly said in a statement. \u201cHowever, these high-risk community organizations often lack cyber threat information and security resources.\u201d\nThe advisory links to reports from the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, Microsoft, Crowdstrike and Cloudflare \u2014 which have all shown startling increases in attacks on civil society organizations.\nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, said on social media that the same groups targeting well-funded governments and Fortune 500 companies also go after civil society, which typically cannot afford to spend resources on cybersecurity tools.\nCitizen Lab has uncovered government hacking campaigns involving spyware tracking dissidents, journalists and others.\n\u201cHistorically law enforcement & governments in democracies have been achingly slow to recognize this issue and help out groups in need. Dissidents & members of diaspora groups have often been met with puzzlement when reporting complex digital security concerns to local police,\u201d Scott-Railton said.\n\u201cExplicit recognition by a group of democracies of the scale of the threat to civil society and its texture of the challenge is an important first step and hopefully opens the conversation for more leaning in from the signatories.\u201d\nThe 19-page advisory provides troves of mitigations and measures civil society organizations can take to better protect their workers. It also urges software and hardware manufacturers to make products that have cybersecurity embedded in them.\nBryan Vorndran, assistant director of the FBI\u2019s cyber division, said the goal of the advisory was to \u201chelp these entities, whether they are nonprofits, think tanks, or groups working to defend human rights and advance democracy, defend themselves against malicious state-sponsored actors looking to exploit them.\u201d\nJonathan Greig\nis a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

Satnam Narang at Tenable said this flaw is being used as part of post-compromise activity to elevate privileges as a local attacker.\n\u201cCVE-2024-30051 is used to gain initial access into a target environment and requires the use of social engineering tactics via email, social media or instant messaging to convince a target to open a specially crafted document file,\u201d Narang said. \u201cOnce exploited, the attacker can bypass OLE mitigations in Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office, which are security features designed to protect end users from malicious files.\u201d\nCVE-2024-30040 is a security feature bypass in MSHTML, a component that is deeply tied to the default Web browser on Windows systems. Microsoft\u2019s advisory on this flaw is fairly sparse, but Kevin Breen from Immersive Labs said this vulnerability also affects Office 365 and Microsoft Office applications.\n\u201cVery little information is provided and the short description is painfully obtuse,\u201d Breen said of Microsoft\u2019s advisory on CVE-2024-30040.\nMeanwhile, Kaspersky Lab, one of two companies credited with reporting exploitation of CVE-2024-30040 to Microsoft, has published a fascinating writeup on how they discovered the exploit in a file shared with Virustotal.com.\nKaspersky said it has since seen the exploit used together with QakBot and other malware. Emerging in 2007 as a banking trojan, QakBot (a.k.a. Qbot and Pinkslipbot) has morphed into an advanced malware strain now used by multiple cybercriminal groups to prepare newly compromised networks for ransomware infestations.\nThe only vulnerability fixed this month that earned Microsoft\u2019s most-dire \u201ccritical\u201d rating is CVE-2024-30044, a flaw in Sharepoint that Microsoft said is likely to be exploited. Tenable\u2019s Narang notes that exploitation of this bug requires an attacker to be authenticated to a vulnerable SharePoint Server with Site Owner permissions (or higher) first and to take additional steps in order to exploit this flaw, which makes this flaw less likely to be widely exploited as most attackers follow the path of least resistance.\nFive days ago, Google released a security update for Chrome that fixes a zero-day in the popular browser. Chrome usually auto-downloads any available updates, but it still may require a complete restart of the browser to install them. If you use Chrome and see a \u201cRelaunch to update\u201d message in the upper right corner of the browser, it\u2019s time to restart.\nApple has just shipped macOS Sonoma 14.5 update, which includes nearly two dozen security patches. To ensure your Mac is up-to-date, go to System Settings, General tab, then Software Update and follow any prompts.\nFinally, Adobe has critical security patches available for a range of products, including Acrobat, Reader, Illustrator, Adobe Substance 3D Painter, Adobe Aero, Adobe Animate and Adobe Framemaker.\nRegardless of whether you use a Mac or Windows system (or something else), it\u2019s always a good idea to backup your data and or system before applying any security updates.

Delivered daily or weekly right to your email inbox.\nAs the FBI Closes In, Scattered Spider Attacks Finance, Insurance Orgs\nScattered Spider is as active as ever, despite authorities claiming that they're close to nailing its members.\nNate Nelson, Contributing Writer\nMay 14, 2024\n4 Min Read\nSource: Design Pics Inc via Alamy Stock Photo\nScattered Spider hackers have been tearing through the finance and insurance sectors, all while authorities are preparing legal actions to stop them.\nA game of cops and robbers is playing out between the FBI and Scattered Spider (aka UNC3944, 0ktapus, Roasted Oktapus, Scatter Swine, Octo Tempest, Muddled Libra), the cybercrime outfit a la mode, ever since its high-profile attacks against MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. If recent rumblings are to be believed, the future of the group might well be determined in short course.\nOn one side, Brett Leatherman, the FBI's cyber deputy assistant director, told reporters in various interviews at RSAC 2024 about the agency's plans to bring charges against members of Scattered Spider, primarily under the well-worn Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\nAnd yet, clearly, Scattered Spider hasn't felt that pressure coming. In recent months it has only expanded its scope, with attacks targeting industries as broad as retail, food services, and video games.\nIn just the past few weeks, the group compromised at least 29 companies in the finance and insurance industries, according to research from Resilience. An anonymous researcher told Bloomberg that among those targeted were household names like Visa, PNC, Transamerica, and New York Life Insurance Co., though they didn't reveal which of those organizations in particular had failed to stop their attackers.\nThis latest campaign has had some of the usual hallmarks of Scattered Spider attacks: lookalike domains mimicking organizations' Okta and content management system (CMS) sign-on pages, with the potential for follow-on SIM swap attacks that leak sensitive corporate data. There was a notable efficiency to the attacks as well, with Scattered Spider swiftly deploying its infrastructure and conducting its attacks in only a few hours' time.\nCan Authorities Take Down Scattered Spider?\nThe effects of law enforcement interventions into cybercrime often are found in the finer details: the confidence that affiliates lose in brand-name groups, the power vacuums that result, and the looming threat to anyone who dares take their place.\nThere's little evidence that major takedowns of infrastructure, or even arrests here and there, take significant numbers of criminals off the web. The keyboard warrior is a shifty species that's tough to find and pin down, and tends to reconstitute in new forms after brief periods of disruption. Worse is when they reside in parts of the world where law enforcement isn't equipped or inclined to help out Western authorities.\nThe rub with Scattered Spider is that it's distinctly not foreign. Its members are thought to be primarily young people in the US and the UK. If ever there were a hacking operation the FBI could wipe out, full stop, it would be this one.\nBut taking out a major hacking operation is not a simple job, says former FBI cyber special agent Adam Marr\u00e8, now chief information security officer (CISO) at Arctic Wolf. \"It's about making sure you can prove all the elements of a crime, and prove it to such a degree that you can get good penalties that will be punitive and discourage others from doing the same thing. It takes a while to build a case like that,\" he explains.\nTo achieve that, he continues, \"They're going to be doing everything from getting informants, or possibly undercovers, into online forums where they can talk to perpetrators whose guard might be down. It's also going to be important for them to collect evidence from victim companies that can be then used to attribute the actions of these actors. The most difficult part is always attribution, so being able to show who was behind the keyboard when that happened takes all the investigative techniques that they have at their disposal.\"\nBecause ironclad attribution is so crucial, and because it's so elusive, the openness and cooperation of targeted organizations may prove the difference in bringing bad guys to justice.\n\"I'm always an advocate that, during peacetime, when you're not attacked, you should still go talk to your local authorities,\" Marr\u00e8 emphasizes. \"Find out who they are, find out what numbers you can call, so that you know these folks when bad things happen. And then, possibly, you can have an effect on the whole cybercrime industry, lessening the likelihood that these things will happen to other people.\"\nAbout the Author(s)\nNate Nelson is a freelance writer based in New York City.

Delivered daily or weekly right to your email inbox.\nNews, news analysis, and commentary on the latest trends in cybersecurity technology.\nA Cost-Effective Encryption Strategy Starts With Key Management\nKey management is more complex than ever. Your choices are: Rely on your cloud provider or manage keys locally; Encrypt only the most critical data; Or encrypt everything.\nRobert Lemos, Contributing Writer\nMay 14, 2024\n4 Min Read\nSource: NicoElNino via Shutterstock\nCompanies have a problem with encryption: While many businesses duly encrypt sensitive data, there is no standard strategy for deploying and managing an key-management infrastructure.\nEvery organization needs to make a large number of decisions in designing a key-management policy that works for their business, Karen Reinhardt, principal engineer for cryptographic services at Home Depot, told attendees at the RSA Conference in San Francisco last week. \"One size does not fit all.\"\nSome cloud-native startups can manage much, if not all, of their encryption keys in the cloud, while large enterprises with legacy technology likely need a locally hosted system and hybrid infrastructure. Some groups, such as developers, may be able to manage their own infrastructure, while general employees need their keys managed for them. Finally, every company needs to take into account the post-quantum future, Reinhardt said.\nEncryption is a necessary technology for securing data and systems, but there is more to data security than just encrypting the data. Perhaps the most complex part of any encryption infrastructure is managing the keys needed to decrypt data. If the attackers has access to the keys, they have access to the encrypted data; defenders who lose access to the keys lose access to data.\nReinhardt outlined five things enterprise security teams should consider to \"keep everybody from putting their proverbial key under their doormat, which is a problem I see all the time.\"\n1. Data Availability Requires Decryption\nThe first lesson for companies is that encryption keys are critical \u2014 perhaps more critical than proper encryption. Data is unusable if you can't decrypt it, so knowing where the decryption keys are is often much more important than knowing the location of the encryption keys, said Reinhardt.\nOrganizations should always have a controlled archive of decryption keys, she said.\n\"The thing about identity is you can always replace it \u2014 okay, you lost your driver's license, let me get you a new one,\" Reinhardt said. \"But if you have data that's encrypted with something, you can only decrypt it one way.\"\n2. 'Encrypt Everything' Might Not Be Worth It\nSecurity controls continue to be expensive to implement, and encryption is no exception. Companies need to measure the cost of creating and managing encryption infrastructure against the cost of a breach to find their \"optimum security at minimum cost,\" Reinhardt said.\n\"Security does you no good if you bankrupt your company,\" she said. \"Stronger controls almost always equals more money, so [while I'm] not actually against 'encrypt everything,' it's a lot of money, a lot of processing, a lot of extra memory \u2014 so 'm more of a fan of focus on what really needs to be kept secret.\"\n3. Cloud Changes Everything, But Gives You Options\nCompanies moving more of their infrastructure to cloud services and platform are already trying to control data sprawl \u2014 cloud-native key management adding key sprawl to the equation as well. Companies need to take stock of not only their critical data \u2014 what needs to be encrypted \u2014 but also how each cloud service manages its keys and other secrets and whether the company can centralize management to increase control.\n\"Where are the keys? Well, a lot of times, they're in a local key store sitting on a system, and in other cases, they can be in a remote store,\" she said. \"They could be anywhere these days \u2014 on-prem, in the cloud, [hosted by] a vendor, or in your own managed cloud.\"\n4. Legacy Integration Remains a Headache\nSmaller companies with just starting with key management can create greenfield key management and take advantage of the latest technologies to simplifying their infrastructure and strengthen control over their data. Yet, large companies who already have a variety of key management technologies in place will have to support legacy applications and databases.\n\"If you're a fairly new company with a greenfield implementation, you might not have the same integration requirements of a company that's been around for 100 years,\" she said.\nYet, cloud-based encryption infrastructure, such as hardware security modules \u2014 secure storage for key data and operations \u2014 can help make implementation simpler and make integration with legacy technology easier.\n5. Post Quantum Means Every Asymmetric Key Must Be Replaced\nFinally, every company needs to consider the post-quantum future and make sure that their key infrastructure can generate quantum-safe keys. As quantum-computing technology advances, public-key encryption will need to evolve and use stronger keys generated by more modern algorithms.\n\"Post-quantum means every asymmetric key has to be replaced, so you need to know where they are,\" she said. \"And that is the big advantage of a key management system \u2014 or any sort of centralized management system \u2014 it will make finding your keys, and rotating them, much easier.\"\nAbout the Author(s)\nVeteran technology journalist of more than 20 years.

Maybe less. Back in the day, kids had to make do with far simpler toys, like spinning discs that just flew up in the air. [JBV Creative] has built a toy just like that with his 3D printer. It may be simple, but it also looks pretty darn fun.\nThe design is straightforward. It uses a power drill to spin up a geartrain, which in turn drives a small disc propeller. Spin the propeller fast enough and it\u2019ll launch high into the air. The geartrain mounts to the drill via the chuck, and it interfaces with the propeller with a simple toothed coupler. Alternatively, there\u2019s also a hand-cranked version if you don\u2019t have a power drill to hand.\nLaunching is easy. First, the drill spins the propeller up to speed. Then, when the drill\u2019s trigger is released, it slows down, and the propeller spins free of the toothed coupler, with the lift it generates carrying it into the sky.\nFiles are available online for those interested. We could imagine this toy could make the basis for a great design competition. Students could compete to optimise the design with more effective gear ratios or better airfoils. We\u2019ve seen similar designs before, too.

Im Gep\u00e4ck hatte das Unternehmen zahlreiche Neuerungen und nat\u00fcrlich hatte alles mit K\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz zu tun.\nWir haben die 9 wichtigsten Ank\u00fcndigungen der I/O f\u00fcr euch zusammengefasst:\nProject Astra\n-\nKI-Suche\n-\nVideo-, Musik- und Bildgeneratoren\n-\nAsk Photos\n-\nVideo-Suche mit Lens\n-\nIndividuelle \u201cGems\u201d\n-\nGemini App f\u00fcr Android\n-\nGemini f\u00fcr Workspace\n-\nSpam-Anrufe erkennen\n-\n1 - Project Astra\nEines der aufregendsten Dinge war \u201cProject Astra\u201d. Dabei handelt es sich um einen KI-Assistenten f\u00fcr den Alltag. \u00dcber eine Kamera - etwa mit einem Handy oder einer smarten Brille - kann die KI die gesamte Umgebung erfassen und Fragen dazu beantworten.\nIn einem Demo-Video war zu sehen, wie eine Anwenderin mit ihrer Handykamera durch ein B\u00fcro geht und fragt: \"Zeige mir alles, was T\u00f6ne macht\". Das Modell erkennt eine Box auf dem Tisch. Dann schaut sie mit ihrer Handykamera aus dem Fenster und fragt, in welchem Stadtteil sie sich gerade befindet. Auch das kann die KI korrekt beantworten. Verf\u00fcgbar werden soll diese Live-Video-Funktion auch \u00fcber die neue Gemini-App (siehe unten). Wann genau,ist aber unbekannt.\nAngeteasert wurde in dem Video auch eine smarte Brille, \u00fcber die die Protagonistin ihre Umgebung filmt. Mehr als das hat Google zu dem Wearable aber nicht verraten.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Fr\u00fchlings-Update f\u00fcr ChatGPT - Premium-Features nun auch in Gratis-Version\n2 - Suche voller KI\nDas Kernprodukt, die Google-Suche, soll dank KI v\u00f6llig umgemodelt werden. AI Overview soll direkt relevante Infos zu den gesuchten Themen liefern, ohne dass man sie m\u00fchsam h\u00e4ndisch zusammensuchen muss.\nAls Beispiel nannte Google ein Szenario, in dem man nach einem Yoga-Studio sucht. AI Overview in der Google-Suche liefert dann nicht nur eine Liste der Studios, sondern auch direkt die Zeit, wie lange man zu jedem Studio zu Fu\u00df geht. Zus\u00e4tzlich aktuelle Angebote und Kartenausschnitte gibt es auf einen Blick. Das alles soll ganz oben auf der Suchseite erscheinen, damit man schnell das Wichtigste im Blick hat.\nKI dient hier als Ausbau f\u00fcr den bereits bekannten Knowledge Graph. Jener zeigt schon jetzt direkt Informationen zum jeweiligen Suchbegriff an, ohne dass man eine Webseite besuchen muss.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Neue Google-KI kann Struktur von DNA voraussagen\n3 - KI-Generatoren f\u00fcr Videos, Musik und Bilder\nGoogles KI-Modell Gemini kann k\u00fcnftig auch Videos generieren. Mit dem generativen KI-Programm Veo k\u00f6nnen Videoclips basierend auf Texteingaben erschaffen werden. Als Beispiel, was das Modell kann, demonstriert Google mehrere Prompts und die Videos dazu. Das erinnert alles stark an Sora, das OpenAI bereits im Februar pr\u00e4sentierte.\nMusic AI Sandbox ist eine Sammlung an KI-Tools, mit der Musik gemacht werden kann. Imagen 3 ist angeblich Googles neues Tool zum Generieren von Bildern. Es soll als erstes derartiges KI-Modell besonders gut im Generieren von Texten, also etwa Schriftz\u00fcgen, sein. Das ist etwas, mit dem sich aktuelle Bildgeneratoren notorisch schwertun.\n4 - Ask Photos\nGemini soll dabei helfen, die eigenen Fotos besser zu durchsuchen. Statt einfach nach Keywords zu suchen, soll man Google Fotos k\u00fcnftig einfach Fragen stellen k\u00f6nnen.\nZum Beispiel \"Wie lautet mein Nummernschild?\" oder \"Wann hat meine Tochter laufen gelernt?\" und Gemini analysiert alle Bilder, um die Frage zu beantworten und die zugeh\u00f6rigen Fotos herauszusuchen. Das funktioniert nat\u00fcrlich nur dann, wenn man sein ganzes Leben in Bildern festh\u00e4lt.\nIm Sommer soll das Feature ausgerollt werden, h\u00f6chstwahrscheinlich aber zu Beginn nur f\u00fcr US-Nutzer*innen. Ob oder wann Ask Photos auch nach Europa kommt bzw. auf Deutsch verf\u00fcgbar sein wird, war vorher noch unklar.\n5 - Video-Suche in Google Lens\nDie bereits bekannte Google-Foto-Suche Lens bekommt ein Upgrade f\u00fcr Videounterst\u00fctzung. Nutzer*innen k\u00f6nnen ihre Frage an Google einfach anhand eines Videoclips stellen, anschlie\u00dfend wird sie beantwortet.\nIn der Demo wurde gezeigt, in welcher Situation das helfen kann. Etwa, wenn man nicht wei\u00df, wie man einen Plattenspieler bedient. Filmt man das Problem, das man hat, soll einem Lens direkt zur gew\u00fcnschten Antwort leiten.\n6 - Gems\n\"Gems\" sind pers\u00f6nliche KI-Funktionen f\u00fcr Gemini, die man selbst erstellen kann. Wenn man eine Anwendung will, die einem beim Arbeiten, bei der Freizeitplanung, beim Sport oder bei der Organisation des Alltags hilft, kann man diese einzeln anlegen und schneller auf sie zugreifen. Vergleichbar ist das mit \u201cCustom GPTs\u201d. Google nennt als Beispiele einen Trainings-Buddy f\u00fcr Sport, einen Coding-Partner zum Programmieren oder einen Sous-Chef zum Kochen.\nGoogle hat auch selbst schon ein paar solcher Gems angelegt. \u201cLearnLM\u201d ist z.B. eine auf Bildung spezialisierte Anwendung. Das Gem \"Learning Coach\" kann dabei helfen, komplexe Themen zu verstehen oder sich etwas zu merken, wie eine chemische Formel. Der Coach kann auch ein Quiz generieren, basierend auf einer Video-Unterrichtseinheit, mit dem Wissen abgefragt wird. Lehrer*innen sollen mit \u201cLearnLM\u201d z.B. Unterrichtsstunden planen k\u00f6nnen.\nDas Gem \"Trip Planning\" hilft beim Planen von Urlauben. Dabei greift es auf Informationen zur\u00fcck, die es \u00fcber den Trip bereits hat, wie Flugdaten. Das hilft z.B., keine sich \u00fcberlappenden Termine zu buchen. Das setzt nat\u00fcrlich voraus, dass Google Zugriff auf alle n\u00f6tigen Informationen hat.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: So bekommt man das alte Google Maps in der Google-Suche zur\u00fcck\n7 - Gemini App f\u00fcr Android\nGemini bekommt eine eigene, neue App. Mit Texteingabe, Sprache und Video \u00fcber die Kamera kann man mit der KI interagieren. Project Astra, also die Live-Video-Funktion, soll damit nutzbar sein.\nZudem kommt Circle to Search, das bislang nur auf Samsung- und Pixel-Phones verf\u00fcgbar war, so auf alle Android-Handys. Damit kann man Inhalte direkt auf dem Screen einkreisen und bekommt anschlie\u00dfend Suchergebnisse dazu pr\u00e4sentiert.\nWenig \u00fcberraschend muss man in Europa auf die App aber noch warten. In 150 L\u00e4ndern ist sie laut Support-Seite schon verf\u00fcgbar, kein einziges davon geh\u00f6rt zur EU. Sobald die App verf\u00fcgbar ist, findet man die Funktion auch im Google Assistant und unter iOS im \u201cGemini\u201d-Tab in der Google App. Voraussetzung daf\u00fcr ist ein \u201cGemini Advanced\u201d-Abo.\n8 - KI in Workspace\nGesch\u00e4ftskund*innen, die Google Workspace nutzen, erhalten Unterst\u00fctzung von Gemini. Eine spezielle Seitenleiste bietet direkt Hilfe an, z.B. beim Durchsuchen von Gmail. Man kann sich Konversationen zusammenfassen lassen und To-Do-Listen oder Erinnerungen erstellen lassen, die auf Inhalten aus E-Mails oder Meetings basieren.\nEin weiteres KI-Feature f\u00fcr Workspace ist das Organisieren des eigenen Gmail-Posteingangs. Wenn man etwa ein freischaffender Fotograf ist, kann man die KI bitten, alle Rechnungen, die man zugesandt bekommen hat, zu organisieren. Der entsprechende Prompt wird in der Sidebar angezeigt.\nK\u00fcnftig k\u00f6nnen auch ganze Mitarbeiter*innen mit KI erstellt werden. Die \"virtual Teammates\" haben einen Namen und ihnen k\u00f6nnen auch bestimmte \"Rollen\" im Unternehmen zugewiesen werden. Man kann dann etwa direkt \u00fcber Chat mit ihnen kommunizieren und sie Meetings, Unterhaltungen und Dokumenten hinzuf\u00fcgen. Sie beantworten Fragen zu Projekten, etwa ob eine bestimmte Aufgabe schon erledigt wurde.\n9 - Spam-Erkennung mit KI\nEine interessante Neuerung f\u00fcr Android ist eine automatische Erkennung von Spam-Anrufen. Gemini in der On-Device-Variante Nano kann Anrufe direkt auf Ger\u00e4ten analysieren und die Anwender*innen warnen, wenn es ein Betrugsversuch ist.\nEs ist davon auszugehen, dass dieses Feature vorerst nur in den USA und auch nur in Englisch verf\u00fcgbar sein wird. Aber sogar hier bleibt Google hinsichtlich des Ver\u00f6ffentlichungszeitpunktes vage und spricht von den \u201cn\u00e4chsten Monaten\u201d. Es ist auch davon auszugehen, dass das ein Feature sein wird, das exklusiv f\u00fcr Pixel-Phones kommt.\nKommentare", "hash": "c84a58c011433896c9cfd7ce774956fb33b58f5b23d6e6f0da5ca15d9189bdf1", "id": "326c210a-fa26-4e80-97a3-2b6bb24e7192", "link": "https://futurezone.at/produkte/google-io-keynote-wichtigste-ankuendigungen-kuenstliche-intelligenz-gemini-android/402896375", "osint_source_id": "eec2ad26-2f4c-4dd8-a3e5-08c0eb3765ca", "published": "2024-05-14T20:00:12", "source": "https://futurezone.at/xml/rss", "story_id": "9413418f-36be-4275-89d0-1e6d37b0c823", "title": "KI \u00fcberall im Alltag: Die 9 wichtigsten Ank\u00fcndigungen der Google I/O"}], "tags": {"Android": {"name": "Android", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Europa": {"name": "Europa", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Gemini": {"name": "Gemini", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Google": {"name": "Google", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Google Workspace": {"name": "Google Workspace", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "KI-Suche": {"name": "KI-Suche", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Samsung": {"name": "Samsung", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "USA": {"name": "USA", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "iOS": {"name": "iOS", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "KI \u00fcberall im Alltag: Die 9 wichtigsten Ank\u00fcndigungen der Google I/O"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-15T01:20:54.591748", "id": "09289013-2e4b-4eb6-a9f6-6b90e1a83434", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "13"}, {"created": "2024-05-15T01:10:53.747278", "id": "8b508673-dd8e-4459-8c48-afb66484bc27", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "6"}], "created": "2024-05-14T20:00:00", "id": "6410b27f-c2c1-4837-9283-d4b3255e7742", "news_items": [{"author": "Lukasz Konieczny", "content": "Eine Fahrt mit einem Elektrofahrrad hebt den Spa\u00df beim Radeln auf ein ganz neues Level. Ob bei einer Tour durch den Wald oder eine Steigung hinauf auf den n\u00e4chsten Gipfel \u2013 damit gelingen steile Abschnitte mit weniger Kraftaufwand, sodass Fahrer noch besser die atemberaubende Umgebung genie\u00dfen k\u00f6nnen. Da \u00fcberrascht es nicht, dass diese Zweir\u00e4der mit elektrischer Unterst\u00fctzung immer beliebter werden in Deutschland.\nDie bequemste M\u00f6glichkeit, das E-Bike in die Berge oder an den n\u00e4chsten Urlaubsort zu bringen, ist das Auto \u2013 Deutschland-Ticket hin oder her. Im Innenraum des Fahrzeugs fehlt allerdings h\u00e4ufig der ben\u00f6tigte Stauraum. Das gilt besonders, wenn noch Gep\u00e4ck dazukommt. Wer keine Lust hat, die R\u00e4der und andere Elemente abzumontieren, verwendet einen passenden Fahrradtr\u00e4ger.\nEin Pedelec bringt aber besondere Herausforderung mit sich. Zum einen ist das E-Bike mit Motor und Akku deutlich schwerer als ein herk\u00f6mmliches Fahrrad. Bis auf wenige Ausnahmen wie das beliebte Urtopia Carbon 1 (Testbericht) oder das Accolmile E-Road (Testbericht) wiegen die meisten Pedelecs deutlich mehr als 20 Kilogramm. Die elektronischen Komponenten ben\u00f6tigen ferner besonderen Schutz. Die Rahmenbreite ist meistens auch gr\u00f6\u00dfer. Was das Angebot passender E-Bike-Tr\u00e4ger angeht und was dabei zu beachten ist, kl\u00e4rt dieser Ratgeber.\nPassende Elektrofahrr\u00e4der pr\u00e4sentieren wir in diesen Bestenlisten:\nWeiteres praktisches Zubeh\u00f6r f\u00fcr Autos zeigen wir in diesen Artikeln:\nTop 10: Die besten elektronischen Parkscheiben mit Zulassung im Test\n-\nTop 10: Die besten Dashcams f\u00fcrs Auto im Test \u2013 Nextbase, Garmin, Viofo & Co.\n-\nTop 5: Die besten Displays f\u00fcr Android Auto & Apple Carplay zum Nachr\u00fcsten\n-\nTop 5: Die besten Adapter f\u00fcr Android Auto Wireless \u2013 Smartphone kabellos nutzen\n-\nWelche Fahrradtr\u00e4ger sind f\u00fcr E-Bikes geeignet?\nEin klassischer Dachtr\u00e4ger ist einfach zu montieren, bietet allerdings Einschr\u00e4nkungen bei der Zuladung. Die meisten dieser Tr\u00e4ger erlauben nur ein H\u00f6chstgewicht von 15 bis 20 Kilogramm. Was bei einem normalen Fahrrad ausreicht, ist f\u00fcr ein E-Bike oft zu wenig. Zudem beeinflusst das Fahrrad auf dem Dach das Fahrverhalten bei Seitenwind und erh\u00f6ht den Kraftstoffverbrauch laut ADAC um bis zu 34 Prozent.\nGeht es um ein Zweirad mit einem h\u00f6heren Gewicht, bietet eine Fahrradhalterung f\u00fcr die Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung eindeutig Vorteile. Diese erlaubt von Natur aus eine deutlich h\u00f6here Zuladung. Positiv ist auch, dass der Mehrverbrauch an Kraftstoff von allen Tr\u00e4gersystemen mit 6,3 Prozent am niedrigsten ist. Gibt es keine Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung, entf\u00e4llt diese Option.\nEine Alternative ist der Hecktr\u00e4ger. Sie sind f\u00fcr Fahrzeuge mit gro\u00dfen Heckklappen geeignet, etwa einen Minivan, Kombi, Kleinbus, Wohnmobil oder SUV \u2013 in Ausnahmef\u00e4llen auch bei einem Kompaktwagen. Allerdings ist hier dann die Sicht nach Hinten eingeschr\u00e4nkt und der Mehrverbrauch von Kraftstoff mit bis zu 44 Prozent am h\u00f6chsten. Den Fahrradtr\u00e4ger befestigt man hierzu an der Heckt\u00fcr. Die maximale Zuladung liegt auf dem Niveau eines Kupplungstr\u00e4gers.\nFahrradtr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung: welche St\u00fctzlast?\nWer bereits eine Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung hat, sollte \u00fcber einen dazu passenden Fahrradtr\u00e4ger nachdenken. Beachten sollte man zudem die Bauform. Meistens sind die Rahmen bei elektrifizierten R\u00e4dern deutlich dicker \u2013 speziell, wenn sich der Akku im Rahmen befindet. Das kann zu Problemen f\u00fchren, wenn die Halteklammern den Rahmen nicht mehr richtig umschlie\u00dfen k\u00f6nnen. Es gibt spezielle E-Bike-Fahrradtr\u00e4ger, dazu geh\u00f6rt etwa der Thule Velospace XT 2, Eufab Jake, Altera Strada E-Bike oder Altera Strada Vario. Gut f\u00fcr E-Bikes geeignet sind zudem der Fahrradtr\u00e4ger Premium II von Eufab, die Modelle Atera Strada Sport M, Strada Evo 2 sowie Bullwing SR3, Bullwing SR7 oder Bullwing SR11. Thule Epos ist nur in der Variante f\u00fcr zwei E-Bikes zu empfehlen bei einer St\u00fctzlast von 60 Kilogramm.\nVor dem Kauf und der Montage sollte man die maximale St\u00fctzlast der Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung im Auge behalten. Diese gibt an, viel Gewicht von oben auf die Deichsel einwirken darf. Dieser Wert ist unabh\u00e4ngig von der St\u00fctzlast des Radtr\u00e4gers zu betrachten. G\u00e4ngig ist eine St\u00fctzlast zwischen 50 und 75 Kilogramm. Bei einer nachger\u00fcsteten Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung sollte ein Aufkleber an der Heckklappe oder dem Heckblech dar\u00fcber Auskunft geben. Bei neuen Fahrzeugen steht die m\u00f6gliche St\u00fctzlast im Feld 13 der Zulassungsbescheinigung Teil I.\nDie maximale Zuladung des Kupplungs-Fahrradtr\u00e4gers sollte idealerweise bei 60 Kilogramm oder h\u00f6her liegen, sofern die St\u00fctzlast der Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung das zul\u00e4sst. Hier gilt es immer den niedrigeren Wert zu beachten, auch wenn die St\u00fctzlast des Fahrradtr\u00e4gers h\u00f6her sein sollte als die der Kupplung am PKW. Das Angebot in diesem Bereich ist recht gro\u00df.\nDie einfache Montage auf der Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung gelingt bei einer vormontierten Variante relativ schnell. Wichtig ist es, die Stromversorgung mit der Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung zu verbinden, damit die R\u00fcck- und Bremslichter am Tr\u00e4ger funktionieren. Das ist gesetzlich vorgeschrieben. Zus\u00e4tzlich ben\u00f6tigt der E-Bike-Fahrradtr\u00e4ger auf der Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung ein weiteres amtliches Kennzeichen. Die Fahrr\u00e4der d\u00fcrfen au\u00dferdem nicht mehr als 40 Zentimeter pro Seite \u00fcber die Schlussleuchte hinausragen. Und das mit R\u00e4dern beladene Auto darf eine Breite von 2,55 Meter nicht \u00fcberschreiten. ADAC und T\u00dcV empfehlen zudem eine H\u00f6chstgeschwindigkeit von 120 Kilometer pro Stunde.\nTr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr die Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung sind teurer als f\u00fcr Heckklappe oder Dach. Einen weiteren Nachteil gibt es bei Fahrradtr\u00e4gern f\u00fcr die Kupplung: Die Parksensoren geben permanent Warnlaute von sich und m\u00fcssen abgeschaltet werden. Es gibt aber Kupplungstr\u00e4gern mit integrierten Abstandswarnern. Denkbar w\u00e4re es, eine akustische Einparkhilfe f\u00fcrs Auto (Ratgeber) f\u00fcr den Tr\u00e4ger nachzur\u00fcsten.\nWas sollte man bei der Auswahl eines E-Bike-Fahrradtr\u00e4gers f\u00fcr die Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung beachten? Dieser sollte mindestens 60 Kilogramm tragen und zwei R\u00e4der aufnehmen k\u00f6nnen. Nach M\u00f6glichkeit sollte der Tr\u00e4ger von Haus aus f\u00fcr E-Bikes optimiert sein, um eine sichere Befestigung zu erm\u00f6glichen. Idealerweise kann man den Fahrradtr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr die Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung nach hinten klappen, um besser an den Kofferraum zu gelangen. Die meisten der hier vorgestellten Tr\u00e4ger bieten diese M\u00f6glichkeit.\nFahrradtr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr E-Bikes - Bilderstrecke\nFahrradtr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr E-Bikes - Bilderstrecke\nAusprobiert haben wir die Fahrradtr\u00e4ger Westfalia BC 60 f\u00fcr 495 Euro sowie den Thule Easyfold XT 3 f\u00fcr 770 Euro. Das Modell von Westfalia ist in weniger als einer Minute auf die Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung gesteckt. Der Fahrradtr\u00e4ger ist zudem zusammenklappbar, was viel Platz in der Garage oder dem Keller spart. Der Westfalia BC 60 bietet Platz f\u00fcr zwei R\u00e4der und hat eine Zuladung von 60 Kilogramm.\nPraktisch am Thule Easyfold XT3 ist die M\u00f6glichkeit, den Tr\u00e4ger umzuklappen, um etwa das Fahrzeug zu beladen. Der Thule-Fahrradtr\u00e4ger bietet drei Abstellpl\u00e4tze. Die maximale Traglast betr\u00e4gt allerdings ebenfalls 60 Kilogramm, sodass man in der Regel nicht mehr als zwei E-Bikes damit transportieren kann.\nFahrradtr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr die Heckklappe: Was ist zu beachten?\nWas ist, wenn man keine Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung hat? Dann ist eine Fahrradhalterung f\u00fcr die Heckt\u00fcr die Alternative, sofern man einen Kombi oder Kompaktwagen mit f\u00fcnf T\u00fcren f\u00e4hrt. Zur Befestigung am Auto montiert der Fahrer den Tr\u00e4ger normalerweise am Autodach und an der unteren Seite der Heckklappe. Hier besteht die Gefahr von Lacksch\u00e4den bei der Montage, deshalb sollte man behutsam vorgehen. Am besten macht man das zu zweit. Nach der Montage kann man der Kofferraum weiterhin \u00f6ffnen. Die meisten Hersteller empfehlen auch mit Hecktr\u00e4ger hier eine H\u00f6chstgeschwindigkeit von 120 Kilometern pro Stunde.\nDas zul\u00e4ssige Gesamtgewicht f\u00fcr die Zuladung reicht bei den hier vorgestellten Tr\u00e4gern von 50 bis 60 Kilogramm. Diese Halterungen bieten Platz f\u00fcr zwei Fahrr\u00e4der \u2013 hier gilt es wieder auf das maximale Gewicht der beiden Zweir\u00e4der zu achten. Neben der zul\u00e4ssigen Tragf\u00e4higkeit sollte man vor dem Kauf pr\u00fcfen, ob der Fahrradtr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr das Heck auch zum jeweiligen Auto passt. Einige spezielle Tr\u00e4gerl\u00f6sungen eignen sich nur f\u00fcr bestimmte Modelle, etwa einen VW T3, T4 oder T6.\nWelche Dachtr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr E-Bikes?\nDer Vorteil des Dachtr\u00e4gers: Er ist universal einsetzbar und eignet sich f\u00fcr Kompaktwagen, Limousinen oder Kombis. Verf\u00fcgt der PKW \u00fcber eine Reling, gestaltet sich die Befestigung auf dem Dach am einfachsten. Zu unterscheiden ist zwischen einer geschlossenen und einer offenen Reling. Die geschlossene Reling f\u00fchrt \u00fcber das Autodach wie eine Schiene, w\u00e4hrend die offene Variante nur vorn und hinten befestigt ist.\nEine Reling ist aber keine Voraussetzung zur Befestigung. Bei vielen Automodellen finden sich Fixpunktbefestigungen, die bereits in das Autodach integriert sind. Unter einer Kunststoffabdeckung liegt dann ein eingelassenes Gewinde f\u00fcr Schrauben. Alternativ gibt es bei vielen Fahrzeugen eine T-Nut zur Befestigung. Aber auch ohne spezielle Dachtr\u00e4gerbefestigung ist die Montage m\u00f6glich.\nBei einem Dachtr\u00e4ger gibt es allerdings gro\u00dfe Einschr\u00e4nkungen beim Transport eines E-Bikes. Hier sollte man strengstens auf die h\u00f6chstzul\u00e4ssige Dachlast achten, denn ein normales E-Bike wiegt meistens mehr als 20 Kilogramm, was die maximale Traglast der meisten Dachtr\u00e4ger \u00fcberschreitet. Damit kommen Dachtr\u00e4ger als Option nur bedingt infrage. Zudem ist es nicht gerade komfortabel, schwere E-Bikes auf den Pkw zu wuchten \u2013 weshalb man das nicht allein machen sollte.\nVor der Befestigung des Zweirads sollten Fahrer unbedingt das Gewicht des elektrifizierten Zweirads pr\u00fcfen \u2013 und nach M\u00f6glichkeit schwere Komponenten wie den Akku entfernen, da dieser mit 3 bis 5 Kilogramm ziemlich schwer ist. Diesen transportiert man gemeinsam mit lockeren und losen Bauteilen am besten im Kofferraum. Meistens befinden sich die Akkus auf dem Fahrradrahmen.\nAllerdings gibt es Modelle mit einem im Rahmen integrierten Akku. Bei City-Bikes befindet sich der Akku h\u00e4ufig unter dem Gep\u00e4cktr\u00e4ger. Nach der Demontage empfehlen wir, die empfindliche Elektronik des E-Bikes zu sch\u00fctzen. Dies gilt f\u00fcr offenliegende Kontakte am Akkusteckplatz sowie die Steuerungseinheit und den Motor. Idealerweise \u00fcberklebt man diese oder deckt sie mit einem Regenschutz ab.\nDie H\u00f6chstgeschwindigkeit von 120 Kilometer pro Stunde sollte man nicht \u00fcberschreiten. Zus\u00e4tzlich muss der Fahrer bei niedrigen Einfahrten, Tunneln oder Br\u00fccken beachten, dass sein Fahrzeug nun h\u00f6her ist. Folgende Modelle tragen eine Last von 20 Kilogramm oder mehr:\nWelcher Fahrradtr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr zwei E-Bikes?\nNahezu alle Kupplungs-Fahrradtr\u00e4ger bieten Platz f\u00fcr zwei Fahrr\u00e4der, manche auch f\u00fcr mehr. Hier ist es wichtig, auf die maximale Traglast zu beachten. 40 Kilogramm m\u00f6gen bei zwei normalen Mountainbikes noch ausreichen, bei zwei E-Bikes w\u00e4re das aber zu wenig. Deshalb empfiehlt sich ein Tr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr die Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung mit einer Zuladung von mindestens 60 Kilogramm oder mehr. Dasselbe gilt f\u00fcr den Hecktr\u00e4ger.\nEmpfehlenswert sind hier Fahrradtr\u00e4ger, die vom Hersteller zus\u00e4tzlich f\u00fcr E-Bikes entworfen wurden. Dann ist auch bei einem dickeren Fahrradrahmen genug Platz, um beide R\u00e4der aufzusatteln. Wer die St\u00fctzlast bewusst \u00fcberschreitet, geht ein gro\u00dfes Risiko ein und handelt fahrl\u00e4ssig \u2013 was zu schweren Unf\u00e4llen f\u00fchren kann. Aus gutem Grund gibt es Bu\u00dfgelder: Wer die St\u00fctzlast um 25 Prozent \u00fcberschreitet, muss mit einer Strafe von 25 Euro rechnen. Ab mehr als 50 Prozent wird ein Bu\u00dfgeld von 60 Euro f\u00e4llig.\nWas ist der beste Fahrradtr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr E-Bikes?\nDie beste L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr ein E-Bike ist ein Fahrradtr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr die Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung, der gen\u00fcgend St\u00fctzlast mitbringt, um das hohe Gewicht eines Pedelecs zu stemmen. Wer keine Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung hat, kann als Alternative \u00fcber einen Tr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr die Heckklappe nachdenken \u2013 ein entsprechendes Fahrzeug mit drei oder f\u00fcnf T\u00fcren vorausgesetzt. Dachtr\u00e4ger eignen sich nur f\u00fcr leichte E-Bikes bis maximal 20 Kilogramm.\nWo ben\u00f6tige ich eine Warntafel?\nIn Deutschland, \u00d6sterreich oder der Schweiz ist keine zus\u00e4tzliche Warntafel vorgeschrieben, wenn man mit dem Auto ein Fahrrad transportiert.\nAnders sieht das im Ausland aus. Wer mit den R\u00e4dern in den Urlaub f\u00e4hrt, sollte sich deshalb vorab informieren. In folgenden europ\u00e4ischen L\u00e4ndern besteht eine Pflicht zur Warntafel beim Transport von Gegenst\u00e4nden mit dem Pkw, die \u00fcber die im Fahrzeugschein eingetragene L\u00e4nge hinausreichen:\nItalien: Die Warntafel aus Metall sollte f\u00fcnf rote und vier wei\u00dfe Streifen aufweisen und eine Abmessung von 50 \u00d7 50 cm haben. Ohne Warntafel drohen Bu\u00dfgelder ab 80 Euro. Eine Variante f\u00fcr Italien mit f\u00fcnf Streifen kostet 25 Euro bei Amazon.\nSpanien: Die Warntafel f\u00fcr Spanien ben\u00f6tigt drei rote und zwei wei\u00dfe Streifen, misst ebenfalls 50 \u00d7 50 cm und sollte aus Aluminium sein. Bu\u00dfgelder bei Verst\u00f6\u00dfen beginnen bei 200 Euro. Eine Warntafel f\u00fcr Spanien kostet 28 Euro bei Amazon.\nPortugal: Hier gelten die gleichen Bestimmungen wie in Spanien, deshalb eignet sich die gleiche Warntafel. Bu\u00dfgelder betragen rund 120 Euro.\nWelche E-Bikes sind besonders leicht?\nIst der Dachtr\u00e4ger aufgrund der Beschaffenheit des PKW die einzig m\u00f6gliche Wahl, sollte man beim Kauf eines E-Bikes auf besonders leichte Modelle achten. Idealerweise kommen hier Varianten zum Einsatz, die es erlauben den Akku abzunehmen, um zus\u00e4tzlich Gewicht zu sparen. Mehr \u00fcber diese Modelle zeigen wir in der Top 8: Die besten leichten E-Bikes im Test \u2013 Testsieger ab 660 Euro.\nZu den besonders leichten E-Bikes aus unseren Tests geh\u00f6ren folgende Modelle:\nUrtopia Carbon 1 (Testbericht) mit einem Gewicht von 15 Kilogramm f\u00fcr 2700 Euro\n-\nFiido C21 (Testbericht) mit einem Gewicht von 18 Kilogramm f\u00fcr 1000 Euro\n-\nAccolmile E-Road (Testbericht) mit einem Gewicht von 18 Kilogramm f\u00fcr 669 Euro\n-\nLemmo One (Testbericht) mit einem Gewicht von 20 Kilogramm f\u00fcr 2000 Euro\n-\nFolgende E-Bikes wiegen nicht mehr als 20 Kilogramm:\nFaltbare E-Bikes als Alternative\nWer auf einen zus\u00e4tzlichen Fahrradtr\u00e4ger verzichten will, aber nicht gen\u00fcgend Stauraum im Auto hat, kann zu einem elektischen Klapprad greifen. Einfacher zu verstauen, sind Klappr\u00e4der. Geeignete Modelle zeigen wir in der Top 10: E-Klapprad \u2013 die besten E-Bikes zum Falten ab 500 Euro im Test.\nFazit\nBeim Transport eines E-Bikes mit dem Auto ergeben sich zus\u00e4tzliche Herausforderungen: Es ist schwerer als ein herk\u00f6mmliches Fahrrad. Wichtig ist es, das zul\u00e4ssige Gesamtgewicht des Tr\u00e4gers nicht zu \u00fcberschreiten. Wegen der begrenzten St\u00fctzlast eignen sich Dachtr\u00e4ger nur bedingt f\u00fcr ein E-Bike \u2013 au\u00dfer man besitzt ein leichtes Modell. Wer diesen Schritt dennoch wagt, sollte den schweren Akku entfernen und im Kofferraum mitf\u00fchren.\nBesser geeignet f\u00fcr ein E-Bike sind Fahrradtr\u00e4ger f\u00fcr die Heckklappe und insbesondere die Anh\u00e4ngerkupplung. Erstere passen nicht zu jedem Automodell, letztere setzen eine Kupplung zwingend voraus. Wer damit nach Italien oder Spanien f\u00e4hrt, ben\u00f6tigt zudem eine Warntafel.\nDamit die Sicherheit beim Fahren nicht zu kurz kommt, empfehlen wir die Top 5: Die besten smarten Fahrradhelme mit Blinker, Bluetooth & Musik im Test.

Google sei gerade in der \"Gemini-\u00c4ra\" \u2013 und auch auf der I/O wird es viel um Gemini und seine Epigonen gehen.\nDas KI-Modell Gemini soll noch leistungsf\u00e4higer werden und erscheint in einer neuen Version, die Google nun \"Gemini 1.5 Flash\" nennt. Zu den weiteren H\u00f6hepunkten d\u00fcrfte Veo geh\u00f6ren, eine Video-KI, die es mit Sora von OpenAI aufnehmen k\u00f6nnen soll. Die Suchmaschine bekommt eine \"AI Overview\", das sind automatisch verfasste Zusammenfassungen zur Suchanfrage, die oberhalb der Suchergebnisse angezeigt wird. Mit Project Astra arbeitet Google an einer Funktion, die in OpenAIs ChatGPT frisch eingezogen ist \u2013 dabei kann man zugleich mittels Kamera und Sprache mit Gemini (dem Chatbot) interagieren. Unter dem Namen Gemini Live steckt die Funktion demn\u00e4chst auch in der Gemini-App f\u00fcr Advanced-Kunden.\nGemini ist das aktuelle KI-Modell von Google, das es in verschiedenen Versionen gibt. Die bisher gr\u00f6\u00dfte Version, Gemini 1.5 Pro, kommt ab sofort mit einer Kontextl\u00e4nge von einer Million Token daher \u2013 f\u00fcr Vertex AI und Google AI Studio Kunden. Die Kontextl\u00e4nge f\u00fcr Entwickler, die die API nutzen und Kunden von Google Cloud, wird nun sogar auf zwei Millionen Token erweitert. Gemini 1.5 Pro ist laut Google in allen Bereichen verbessert worden. \u00dcber die API und Google AI Studio kann das Model bereits mit Audio und Video umgehen.\nAu\u00dferdem wird Gemini in mehr Dienste einziehen, beispielsweise in Googles Messages. Die Erweiterungen werden mehr, etwa eine Youtube-Extension, der Kalender wird integriert, ebenso Tasks. Dadurch kann man \u00fcber die Gemini-App beispielsweise ein Foto von einem Veranstaltungshinweis machen, der in den Kalender \u00fcbertragen wird. Gems sind personalisierte KI-Chatbots, die Advanced-Nutzer f\u00fcr sich erstellen k\u00f6nnen. Das scheint \u00e4hnlich Metas AI Personas zu sein. Beispielsweise kann man sich einen Lauf-Coach erstellen.\nAls offenes Modell stellt Google Gemma 2 vor, ein Modell mit neuer Architektur \u2013 konkreter wird es zun\u00e4chst nicht. Neu ist auch das offene PaliGemma, ein Vision-Language Model.\nGemini 1.5 Flash und Project Astra f\u00fcr immersive Erlebnisse\nGemini 1.5 Flash soll besonders kosteneffizient und schnell sein. Google sagt, das sei eine oft gew\u00fcnschte Eigenschaft. Das Modell eignet sich laut Google hervorragend f\u00fcr s\u00e4mtliche Aufgaben von Chat bis Bild- und Videobeschriftung oder Datenanalysen. \"Das liegt daran, dass es von 1.5 Pro durch einen Prozess namens 'Destillation' trainiert wurde, bei dem die wichtigsten Kenntnisse und F\u00e4higkeiten aus einem gr\u00f6\u00dferen Modell auf ein kleineres, effizienteres Modell \u00fcbertragen werden\", erkl\u00e4rt Demis Hassabis, CEO von Google DeepMind.\nDer Unterschied zu Gemini Nano liegt darin, dass das bisher kleinste Gemini Model f\u00fcr Mobilger\u00e4te optimiert ist. Mit Pixel-Ger\u00e4ten ist es bald m\u00f6glich Nano mit Multimodalit\u00e4t zu verwenden, also nicht nur durch Text, sondern auch mittels Sehen, H\u00f6ren und gesprochener Sprache.\nGoogle b\u00fcndelt seine Arbeit an KI-Agenten im \"Project Astra\". Diese Agenten m\u00fcssten die Welt verstehen, sich Dinge merken und handeln k\u00f6nnen, damit sie sinnvoll nutzbar sind. Project Astra setzt auf Gemini, sowie auf Aufgaben-spezialisierte Modelle, die Google nicht n\u00e4her benennt. Der zuk\u00fcnftige Google-KI-Assistent soll via Smartphone oder Brillen erreichbar sein. Wann diese \"Glasses\", die im Video auf der I/O zu sehen sind, verf\u00fcgbar werden, sagt Google noch nicht. Die Gemini-App soll noch in diesem Jahr manche der F\u00e4higkeiten bekommen: Gemini Live ist dann allerdings nur f\u00fcr Advanced-Nutzer verf\u00fcgbar.\nOpenAI ist Google mit dieser Anwendung ein bisschen zuvorgekommen. Am Tag vor der I/O hat OpenAI GPT-4o vorgestellt, ein Omnimodel, das, wie sie sagen, nativ Text, Audio und Vision gemeinsam verarbeitet und mit dem dadurch gleichzeitig \u00fcber die Kamera und per Sprache interagiert werden kann. Als Beispiel hat OpenAI gezeigt, wie man ChatGPT per Sprache nach Code fragen kann, der auf einem Bildschirm zu sehen ist. Auch Google zeigt ein Beispiel, bei dem der KI-Assistent Informationen \u00fcber Code geben kann \u2013 was kann er, was ist vielleicht falsch und mehr. Er kann sich offensichtlich auch einiges merken, denn in dem Beispielvideo wei\u00df Gemini, wo er an der Brille, die auf einem Tisch lag, vorbeigekommen ist.\nVeo versus Sora und Imagen 3\nGoogle ist mit der eigenen Video-KI zwar sp\u00e4ter dran als OpenAI mit Sora, allerdings ist die auch noch nicht verf\u00fcgbar. Veo kann Videos in Full-HD (1080p) generieren, die l\u00e4nger als eine Minute sind \u2013 und damit l\u00e4nger als die von Sora. Das Modell versteht Kamera-Einstellungen wie \"Zeitraffer\" und \"Luftaufnahme\". Google betont auch, wie konsistent und koh\u00e4rent die Videos seien \u2013 testen kann man das noch nicht. Zuletzt hatte ein K\u00fcnstler erkl\u00e4rt, dass er bei Sora sehr viel Zeit in die Nachbearbeitung habe stecken m\u00fcssen. Auch Google l\u00e4sst Filmmacher mit Veo experimentieren, erste K\u00fcnstler sollen Zugriff \u00fcber VideoFX haben. Einige Funktionen ziehen zudem in Youtube Shorts ein, erkl\u00e4rt Google.\nDer Bildgenerator Imagen erscheint in Version 3 und soll rundherum verbessert worden sein: beim Umgang mit Text, in der Wiedergabe von Stilen, im Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr Prompts. Imagen 3 ist \u00fcber ImageFX als Preview verf\u00fcgbar und kommt bald in Vertex AI.\nLyria ist Googles Generative Musik KI. K\u00fcnftig werden alle Musik-Dienste in der Music AI Sandbox zusammengef\u00fchrt. SynthID ist ein nicht wahrnehmbares digitales Wasserzeichen, das in Bilder, Audio, Text und Video eingebettet werden kann.\nAI Overview \u2013 Googles KI-Suche\nGoogle weitet die KI-Suche aus. Das hei\u00dft allerdings nicht, dass Google die bisherige Suche durch eine neuartige KI-Suche ersetzt. Stattdessen versucht Google weiterhin, das Beste aus beiden Welten zu verbinden: Die gigantische Wissensbasis, die Google neben der Suchfunktion bereith\u00e4lt, wird weiterhin als solche verf\u00fcgbar sein und bestehen bleiben. Hinzukommt AI Overview, die KI-generierten Antworten, die oberhalb der Linklisten stehen, aber nur erscheinen, wenn es nach der Meinung von Google auch Sinn macht.\nIn der Google Suche steckt eine angepasste Version von Gemini, dem KI-Modell. \"Es vereint die fortschrittlichen F\u00e4higkeiten von Gemini \u2013 einschlie\u00dflich mehrstufiger Entscheidungsfindung, Planung und Multimodalit\u00e4t \u2013 mit unseren erstklassigen Suchsystemen\", sagt Liz Reid, Head of Search, bei ihrer Vorstellung der Such-Zukunft. Die Menschen, die bisher AI Overviews in der Testumgebung von Google ausprobiert haben, seien zufriedener mit den Ergebnissen gewesen, als vorher. Ende des Jahres ist es nun soweit, dass die Funktion aus der Testphase in den normalen Betrieb wechselt. Wer dann darauf zugreifen kann, bleibt dennoch unklar \u2013 es hei\u00dft, \"Milliarden Menschen\". Bisher ist AI Overview \u00fcber Google Labs nicht in der EU verf\u00fcgbar.\nGoogles Kerngesch\u00e4ft: Werbung in der Suche\nDer Sorge, dass wegen der neuen Antwortform weniger Menschen auf die Webseiten von Verlagen, K\u00fcnstlern und anderen Urhebern surfen und ihnen damit Werbeanzeigen wegbrechen, h\u00e4lt Google entgegen, dass nach ihren Erfahrungen mehr Menschen auf weiterf\u00fchrende Links klicken, wenn diese im KI-generierten Text auftauchen. Werbung wird weiterhin seinen Platz in der Suche finden, hei\u00dft es, wo genau, wird sich zeigen \u2013 ebenso, wie dass wirklich nach wie vor gleich viele Klicks auf den Webseiten landen. Schon die Einf\u00fchrung von Antwortk\u00e4sten (\"Position Null\") in den Suchergebnissen hat manchen Seitenbetreibern Einbu\u00dfen gebracht.\nAI Overview soll bald anpassbar werden, etwa in der Art der Antwort, in der Sprache oder der Tiefe. Zun\u00e4chst ist das allerdings nur in den USA m\u00f6glich. Ebenfalls kann die KI-Suche dort k\u00fcnftig Anfragen beantworten, die aus mehreren Teilen bestehen \u2013 das nennt Google \"multi-step reasoning\".\nAbsolut nicht fehlen darf das Beispiel, wie die Suche beim Planen einer Reise helfen kann. Diese Aufgabe ist immer, ob bei Google oder anderen Anbietern, und seit Jahren der offensichtliche Ma\u00dfstab aller Anwendbarkeit. Daneben soll die KI-Suche aber auch hilfreich sein, wenn man etwa einen Ern\u00e4hrungsplan f\u00fcr die Woche erstellen m\u00f6chte. Es sei ein Leichtes, das zu tun, man k\u00f6nne dabei auch einfach Anpassungen vornehmen, etwa vegetarisch zur Bedingung machen. \"Die Suche passt deinen Essensplan an dich an.\" Das ist bisher wahrhaft keine klassische Such-Anfrage gewesen.\nNeu ist auch, dass die Suchergebnisse eine neue Aufteilung bekommen \u2013 dank KI und erneut nur in den USA und auf Englisch. Das betrifft zun\u00e4chst allerdings einzelne Suchanfragen, beispielsweise Essen, Rezepte, Filme, Musik und weitere.\nGoogles visuelle Suche\nDie Suche bekommt auch eine Video-Erweiterung. Die Funktion kann man als Erweiterung von Google Lens, aber auch Search-to-Circles verstehen, bei dem man ein Element eines Fotos umkreisen kann und daraufhin Suchergebnisse angezeigt bekommt.

spielen, und fordern eine Offensive. Anonymit\u00e4t soll m\u00f6glichst bleiben.\nGeht es nach der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion, sollen digitale Identit\u00e4ten bis 2030 \"das R\u00fcckgrat einer vernetzten und digitalen Gesellschaft bilden, die den einzelnen B\u00fcrger in den Mittelpunkt stellt und gleichzeitig Sicherheit und Privatsph\u00e4re gew\u00e4hrleistet\". Dienste vom Kauf eines Konzerttickets \u00fcber die Bankkontoer\u00f6ffnung bis hin zur Beantragung von staatlichen Leistungen wollen die Konservativen damit befl\u00fcgeln. Dies geht aus dem Entwurf f\u00fcr ein Positionspapier f\u00fcr \"Sichere digitale Identit\u00e4ten als Schl\u00fcssel einer digitalen Gesellschaft\" der Fraktion hervor, den der Online-Dienst Table.Media ver\u00f6ffentlicht hat. Darin hei\u00dft es aber auch: \"Nichtsdestotrotz bleiben digitale Identit\u00e4ten f\u00fcr Personen freiwillig und eine anonyme Nutzung des digitalen Raums muss stets m\u00f6glich sein.\" Eine Pflicht zur Authentifizierung d\u00fcrfe es nur \"mit Begr\u00fcndung\" geben.\nDie Ampel-Koalition kritisieren CDU und CSU, weil sie es bisher verpasst habe, die Verbreitung der elektronischen Identit\u00e4t (eID) auf dem Personalausweis zu forcieren. Die Nutzungsquote des Online-Ausweises liege nur bei rund 14 Prozent, sei also \"weit von einer Massenadaption\" entfernt. Dies habe verschiedene Gr\u00fcnde: angefangen mit fehlenden privatwirtschaftlichen oder staatlichen Anwendungsf\u00e4llen \u00fcber technische Probleme bei der Einbindung bis hin zur 6-stelligen PIN. Auch mit der Einmalzahlung f\u00fcr Studierende oder dem Kulturpass seien \"der gro\u00dfe und vor allem nachhaltige Durchbruch bisher\" ausgeblieben. Daher sei es n\u00f6tig, endlich eine umfassende Strategie f\u00fcr digitale Identit\u00e4ten nebst einem Leitbild zu entwickeln und alle Verwaltungsebenen einzubinden.\nCloud-L\u00f6sung mit Hardware-Sicherheitsmodul\nEine neue Chance f\u00fcr den Aufbau eines \u00d6kosystems sieht die Fraktion laut dem Papier im Rahmen der f\u00e4lligen Umsetzung der Verordnung f\u00fcr eine europ\u00e4ische elektronische Identit\u00e4t (EUid) auf Basis von digitalen Brieftaschen (E-Wallets). Hier m\u00fcsse die Bundesregierung \"eine optimale Balance aus Sicherheit und Nutzerfreundlichkeit\" w\u00e4hlen, um der Verbreitung der EUid Vorschub zu leisten. Die \"vielfach referenzierte L\u00f6sung\" um eine Hardwarekomponente herum wie ein Secure Element oder die eSIM sollte weiterverfolgt werden. F\u00fcr m\u00f6glich halten CDU/CSU aber ferner eine \"Cloud-basierte\" Variante mit einem Hardware-Sicherheitsmodul (HSM), das etwa beim besonderen elektronischen Anwaltspostfach (beA) zum Einsatz kommt, \"als \u00dcbergang\". Dieser Ansatz w\u00fcrde \"dem B\u00fcrger nicht nur eine einfache und niedrigschwellige Nutzung garantieren, sondern mit einer m\u00f6glichen dezentralen Ausgestaltung auch die entsprechende Sicherheit gew\u00e4hrleisten\".\nFerner m\u00fcsse die Regierung mit einer gezielten Kommunikations- und Aufkl\u00e4rungskampagne gemeinsam mit der Wirtschaft und privaten Wallet-Anbietern daf\u00fcr sorgen, die Vorz\u00fcge digitaler Brieftaschen entsprechend zu kommunizieren. Die Exekutive soll zudem \"zeitnah ein Alternativverfahren zum abgesetzten kostenlosen PIN-R\u00fccksetzbrief auf den Weg\" bringen. Eine Wiedereinf\u00fchrung des letztlich teuren analogen Versands w\u00e4re \"mit der Bereitstellung von entsprechenden Haushaltsmitteln\" zwar die naheliegendste Option. Dennoch m\u00fcsse die Regierung aber \"\u00fcber kosteng\u00fcnstigere, einfachere, digitale und schnellere Alternativen nachdenken\". Bestenfalls sollte eine Ende-zu-Ende digitalisierte L\u00f6sung angeboten werden. Eine \"notwendige Br\u00fccke der Verbreitung und Nutzung der eID\" k\u00f6nnte auch die vom Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) vorgeschlagene Smart-Phone-Integration hin zur EUid bilden.\n(olb)", "hash": "39a312f314d7895fa4940d3e55d0097af9f9d31520aad336be47e9d85caedb83", "id": "146d5c31-23ff-4607-a9b3-5b5ff5ee31b1", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Online-Ausweis-CDU-CSU-will-die-eID-in-die-Cloud-bringen-9718306.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-14T19:34:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "234351d4-ce03-4b9c-949a-be1cbb826731", "title": "Online-Ausweis: CDU/CSU will die eID in die Cloud bringen"}], "tags": {"BSI": {"name": "BSI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik": {"name": "Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CDU": {"name": "CDU", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CSU": {"name": "CSU", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "HSM": {"name": "HSM", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Table.Media": {"name": "Table.Media", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "beA": {"name": "beA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "eSIM": {"name": "eSIM", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "Online-Ausweis: CDU/CSU will die eID in die Cloud bringen"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-15T01:26:45.134988", "id": "58cd96d2-f74c-487f-8990-aca548ca0f00", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "8"}], "created": "2024-05-14T19:30:00", "id": "0951537a-52b4-41ab-b4e2-97b4664b517b", "news_items": [{"author": "msmash", "content": "Google's Invisible AI Watermark Will Help Identify Generative Text and Video 11\nAmong Google's swath of new AI models and tools announced today, the company is also expanding its AI content watermarking and detection technology to work across two new mediums.

understand what's taking place in a video feed and converse about it, Google announced Project Astra, a research prototype that features similar video comprehension capabilities. It was announced by Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis on Tuesday at the Google I/O conference keynote in Mountain View, California.\nHassabis called Astra \"a universal agent helpful in everyday life.\" During a demonstration, the research model showcased its capabilities by identifying sound-producing objects, providing creative alliterations, explaining code on a monitor, and locating misplaced items. The AI assistant also exhibited its potential in wearable devices, such as smart glasses, where it could analyze diagrams, suggest improvements, and generate witty responses to visual prompts.\nGoogle says that Astra uses the camera and microphone on a user's device to provide assistance in everyday life. By continuously processing and encoding video frames and speech input, Astra creates a timeline of events and caches the information for quick recall. The company says that this enables the AI to identify objects, answer questions, and remember things it has seen that are no longer in the camera's frame.\nWhile Project Astra remains an early-stage feature with no specific launch plans, Google has hinted that some of these capabilities may be integrated into products like the Gemini app later this year (in a feature called \"Gemini Live\"), marking a significant step forward in the development of helpful AI assistants. It's a stab at creating an agent with \"agency\" that can \"think ahead, reason and plan on your behalf,\" in the words of Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\nElsewhere in Google AI: 2 million tokens\nDuring Google I/O, the company unveiled a large number of AI-related announcements, some of which we may cover in separate posts in the future. But for now, here's a quick overview.\nAt the top of the keynote, Pichai mentioned an \"improved\" version of February's Gemini 1.5 Pro (same version number, oddly) that is coming soon. It will feature a 2 million-token context window, which means it can process large numbers of documents or long stretches of encoded videos at once. Tokens are fragments of data that AI language models use to process information, and the context window determines the maximum number of tokens an AI model can process at once. Currently, 1.5 Pro tops out at 1 million tokens (OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo has a 128,000 token window for comparison).\nWe asked AI researcher Simon Willison\u2014who does not work for Google but was featured in a promo video during the keynote\u2014what he thought of the context window announcement. \"Two million tokens is exciting,\" he replied via text while sitting in the keynote audience. \"But it's worth keeping price in mind that $7 per million tokens means a single prompt could cost you $14!\" Google charges $7 per million input tokens for 1.5 on prompts longer than 150,000 tokens through its API.\nSpeaking of tokens, Google announced that its previously announced 1 million token context window for Gemini 1.5 Pro is finally coming to Gemini Advanced subscribers. Previously, it was only available in the API.\nGoogle also announced a new AI model called Gemini 1.5 Flash, which it billed as a lightweight, faster, and less expensive version of Gemini 1.5. \"1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It\u2019s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale,\" says Google.\nWillison had a comment on Flash as well: \"The new Gemini Flash model is promising there, it's meant to provide up to 2m tokens at a lower price.\" Flash costs $0.35 per million tokens on prompts up to 128,000 tokens and $0.70 per million tokens for prompts longer than 128,000. It's one-tenth the price of 1.5 Pro.\n\"35 cents per million tokens! That's the biggest news of the day, IMO,\" Willison told us.\nGoogle also announced Gems, which appears to be its take on OpenAI's GPTs. Gems are custom roles for the Google Gemini chatbot that will play a part that you define, allowing you to personalize Gemini in different ways.

Imagen 3 is the latest in its line of image synthesis models, which Google says is its \"highest quality text-to-image model, capable of generating images with even better detail, richer lighting and fewer distracting artifacts than our previous models.\"\nGoogle also showed off its Music AI Sandbox, which Google bills as \"a suite of AI tools to transform how music can be created.\" It combines its YouTube music project with its Lyria AI music generator into tools for musicians.\nThe company also announced Google Veo, which is a text-to-video generator that creates 1080P videos from prompts in a quality that seems to match OpenAI's Sora. Google says it is working with actor Donald Glover to create an AI-generated demonstration film that will debut soon. It's far from Google's first AI video generator, but it seems to be its most capable so far.\nThe sample video above, provided by Google, used the prompt, \"A lone cowboy rides his horse across an open plain at beautiful sunset, soft light, warm colors.\"\nGoogle says starting today, its new AI creative tools are available to select creators in a private preview only but that wait lists are open.\nPromoted Comments", "hash": "62796b763de93a196f28446da48d675e4f265b34502c5ebaf04d017f51650676", "id": "20b44cdf-e60b-4eee-bc4b-f8ec21ae1909", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024268", "osint_source_id": "a71fce67-918e-4ec0-bd23-e575b5149c1b", "published": "2024-05-14T19:11:20", "source": "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/technology-lab", "story_id": "86d7cdd6-1a6c-4d43-90a5-356634e9204d", "title": "Google strikes back at OpenAI with \u201cProject Astra\u201d AI agent prototype"}], "tags": {"AI-generated": {"name": "AI-generated", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Astra": {"name": "Astra", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "California": {"name": "California", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Demis Hassabis": {"name": "Demis Hassabis", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Donald Glover": {"name": "Donald Glover", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Gemini": {"name": "Gemini", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Gemini Live": {"name": "Gemini Live", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Google": {"name": "Google", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Hassabis": {"name": "Hassabis", "tag_type": "PER"}, "IMO": {"name": "IMO", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "OpenAI": {"name": "OpenAI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Pichai": {"name": "Pichai", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Simon Willison": {"name": "Simon Willison", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Sundar Pichai": {"name": "Sundar Pichai", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Willison": {"name": "Willison", "tag_type": "PER"}, "YouTube": {"name": "YouTube", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Google strikes back at OpenAI with \u201cProject Astra\u201d AI agent prototype"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-15T01:30:55.190107", "id": "7acf7305-6352-445d-b3cb-7a4c7166116c", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "10"}], "created": "2024-05-14T18:49:00", "id": "b41a3018-b22b-4ccd-bd1a-3dc0e600c76f", "news_items": [{"author": "msmash", "content": "The Walls Are Closing In On John Deere's Tractor Repair Monopoly (404media.co) 67\nsamleecole writes: For the last decade, farmers have been warning that John Deere, a company celebrated by farmers, country musicians, and politicians, has been doing something else very American: Concentrating power, stripping away the ownership rights of people who buy their products, and adding a bevy of artificial, software-based repair restrictions that have effectively created a regime in which farmers can no longer fix their own tractors, combines, harvesters, and other agricultural equipment. Farmers have resorted to pirating John Deere's software and firmware on underground forums and torrent sites, and have used software cracked by Ukrainian pirates in order to simply fix the things they own. Farmers often have to wait days or weeks for an \"authorized\" John Deere dealership to come to their farms to repair their equipment, meanwhile their crops die on the vine.\nFor years, very little happened to slow down John Deere's march toward total control of the repair market. But interviews with farmers, activists, and lawyers, and a review of court records reveal a turn in the story: There is increased scrutiny on Deere's repair practices not just in this class action lawsuit, but from state legislators, the White House, and a series of federal agencies.

"content": "May 2024 Patch Tuesday: Microsoft fixes exploited zero-days (CVE-2024-30051, CVE-2024-30040)\nFor May 2024 Patch Tuesday, Microsoft has released fixes for 59 CVE-numbered vulnerabilities, including two zero-days (CVE-2024-30051, CVE-2024-30040) actively exploited by attackers.\nCVE-2024-30051 and CVE-2024-30040\nCVE-2024-30051 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability affecting the Windows DWM Core Library that can be exploited to elevate attackers\u2019 privileges on a target system. \u201cAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain SYSTEM privileges,\u201d Microsoft says.\nResearchers from Kaspersky, DBAPPSecurity WeBin Lab, Google Threat Analysis Group and Google Mandiant have been credited with reporting it so it has been speculated that the attacks leveraging it are widespread.\nKaspersky researchers Boris Larin and Mert Degirmenci have shared more details: CVE-2024-30051 is being leveraged in conjuction with Qakbot and other malware. \u201c[We] believe that multiple threat actors have access to it,\u201d they said, and promised to publish technical details once users have had time to update their Windows systems.\nThe interesting thing here is how they \u201cdiscovered\u201d the vulnerability: it was described in a file uploaded to VirusTotal.\n\u201cThe exploitation process described in this document was identical to that used in the previously mentioned zero-day exploit for CVE-2023-36033, but the vulnerability was different,\u201d they said.\nCVE-2024-30040 is a vulnerability that allows attackers to bypasses OLE [Object Linking and Embedding] mitigations in Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office (i.e., security features that protect users from malicious files).\nTo exploit it, attackers need to \u201cconvince the user to load a malicious file onto a vulnerable system, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant messenger message, and then convince the user to manipulate the specially crafted file, but not necessarily click or open the malicious file,\u201d Microsoft says.\n\u201cAn unauthenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain code execution through convincing a user to open a malicious document at which point the attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the user.\u201d\nMicrosoft does not say who reported the vulnerability or explains the nature of the attacks for which it is being leveraged.\nOther vulnerabilities of note\nSatnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, says that exploitation of CVE-2024-30044, the only critical vulnerability fixed this month, requires an attacker to be authenticated to a vulnerable SharePoint Server with Site Owner permissions (or higher) first and then take additional steps, \u201cwhich makes this flaw less likely to be widely exploited as most attackers follow the path of least resistance.\u201d\nThe discoverer \u2013 Piotr Bazyd\u0142o \u2013 says it\u2019s the most interesting XML external entity (XXE) injection flaw that he\u2019s ever found.\n\u201cAn authenticated attacker could use this bug to read local files with SharePoint Farm service account user

Es ist jedoch nicht ausgeschlossen, dass die modulare Unterwasserdrohne auch als taktische Waffe verwendet wird.\nDrei Prototypen der Unterwasserdrohne sollte Anduril innerhalb von drei Jahren fertigstellen, hei\u00dft es in einer Mitteilung des R\u00fcstungsunternehmens. Gestartet war das Projekt Mitte 2022. Der Zeitplan konnte eingehalten werden und ist sogar noch unterschritten worden, so Anduril weiter. Zudem sei das Budget, das insgesamt 140 Millionen Australische Dollar betr\u00e4gt, nicht \u00fcberschritten worden.\nAutonomes Operieren in gro\u00dfen Tiefen\nViel ist \u00fcber die 30 Meter lange Unterwasserdrohne Ghost Shark nicht bekannt. Sie soll in Tiefen bis zu 6000 Meter operieren und bis zu 10 Tage lang unter Wasser bleiben k\u00f6nnen. Die Unterwasserdrohnen sollen modular aufgebaut sein und zum Teil aus dem 3D-Drucker kommen. Nur so konnte die kurze Entwicklungszeit und die daf\u00fcr n\u00f6tigen kurzen Lernzyklen erreicht werden, so das R\u00fcstungsunternehmen. Au\u00dferdem sei die Ghost Shark in der Lage, autonom Missionen durchzuf\u00fchren.\nDie Unterwasserdrohne sei mehrzweckf\u00e4hig, hei\u00dft es.

Then this open-source penetration testing tool may be for you. But you will have to build it yourself.\nOr more accurately, you will have to get a company that prints circuit boards and adds the components to build one for you. That sounds complicated, but it isn't, and the reward will be worth it.\nAlso: Flipper Zero: Geeky toy or serious security tool?\nCalled Hackbat, this pocket-sized tool is the brainchild of Pablo Trujillo, and it's built around a custom PCB and a RP2040 microcontroller from the Raspberry Pi Pico W.\nDon't let the idea of custom PCBs scare you because Trujillo has made all the files available you need to have these manufactured, along with the information on all the components needed to populate the board, free of charge.\nHackbat has everything you need to carry out high-end penetration testing duties, with Wi-Fi, NFC, and RF to receive and transmit radio waves, a microSD card slot for storage, USB to allow it to carry out keystroke injection attacks, and a 128x64 pixels OLED display and buttons for human interaction.\nIf you're eager to build your own Hackbat, you have the option to use the PCB printing service recommended by Trujillo -- JLCPCB -- or choose a service you prefer.\nAlso: How to unlock the Flipper Zero's true power\nHowever, if this is your first foray into assembling hardware like this, be prepared for a steep learning curve. A common challenge many newcomers face is component shortages. This may require you to hunt for equivalent components to substitute, which can be a significant part of the learning process. As for cost, that's hard to pin down as component prices and even circuit board printing prices vary daily, but I priced it out the other day and it was about $40 if I had three made.\nIf you're interested in security and electronics, this is a great project to sink your teeth into.", "hash": "a46cd1cb490809b3f59bc1258106e9b8ad66074aa8f5087f51cca79d10795c2b", "id": "c25059c0-d208-43a4-99d3-11c480d46170", "link": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-hackbat-an-open-source-more-powerful-flipper-zero-alternative/%23ftag=RSSbaffb68", "osint_source_id": "ed5d2c82-3035-490c-af95-5844977f7f3d", "published": "2024-05-14T18:35:55", "source": "https://www.zdnet.com/topic/security/rss.xml", "story_id": "174c33d6-3208-4f37-81a1-01bb87a991bf", "title": "Meet Hackbat: An open-source, more powerful Flipper Zero alternative"}], "tags": {"Hackbat": {"name": "Hackbat", "tag_type": "PER"}, "JLCPCB": {"name": "JLCPCB", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "NFC": {"name": "NFC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Pablo Trujillo": {"name": "Pablo Trujillo", "tag_type": "PER"}, "RP2040": {"name": "RP2040", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Trujillo": {"name": "Trujillo", "tag_type": "PER"}, "ZDNet": {"name": "ZDNet", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "Meet Hackbat: An open-source, more powerful Flipper Zero alternative"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-15T09:13:18.283192", "id": "7f98743c-956c-460e-9b28-7a9fd0facef2", "key": "IOC_BOT", "value": "3"}, {"created": "2024-05-15T09:15:17.483637", "id": "ce122dbe-7008-476f-9245-1148f7a23537", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "13"}, {"created": "2024-05-15T09:12:01.760452", "id": "d92e8e43-05f4-4887-ab71-b4a5f661cb37", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-14T18:28:32", "id": "502db54c-9d21-451b-b9df-a8cca7e90df8", "news_items": [{"author": "Ryan Naraine", "content": "Microsoft rolled out its latest security updates on Tuesday, addressing approximately 60 vulnerabilities across various software products and called urgent attention to an actively exploited zero-day reported by multiple external threat-hunting teams.\nThe zero-day bug, tagged as CVE-2024-30051, is documented as a heap-based buffer overflow in the Windows Desktop Window Manager (DWM) Core Library that\u2019s already been exploited in malware attacks that require elevated SYSTEM privileges.\nThe bug carries a CVSS severity score of 7.8/10 and an \u201cimportant\u201d rating from Redmond.\nMicrosoft credited security researchers from Kaspersky, DBAPPSecurity, and Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group for identifying and reporting the issue, suggesting it may have already been used beyond targeted attacks.\nAs is customary, Microsoft did not share details on the exploitation of IOCs to help defenders hunt for signs of intrusions.\nMicrosoft also marked CVE-2024-30040 in the already-exploited category, warning that attackers are bypassing security features in Microsoft 365 and Office.

One of those cases, against the data broker Outlogic, centered on FTC allegations that the peddled data could be used to track consumers\u2019 visits to sensitive locations such as reproductive health clinics.\nA second case cited in the post involved the data broker InMarket Media, which the FTC alleged illegally used sensitive data to organize consumers into advertising audience segments.\nFTC blog posts are usually the result of significant internal discussion and even listening sessions and workshops within the agency, said John Davisson, director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.\n\u201cThese posts are a warning to industry and to regulated entities \u2026 take note, fix your business practices, if they're not compliant with this,\u201d Davisson said, adding that they are \u201ca way for the FTC to convey this is the way they're going to approach enforcement.\u201d\nDefense lawyers often publicly flag FTC blog posts on their firms\u2019 websites \u201cbecause these attorneys that do compliance work are trying to read the tea leaves and make it clear to their clients and others that these are the rules of the road,\u201d he said.\nCar privacy advocate Andrea Amico, who is CEO of Privacy4Cars, said the blog post is a \u201cbig shot across the bow from the FTC to the broad auto industry \u2014 not just the manufacturers \u2014 on the need to dramatically step up their privacy practices on disclosure, use, and disposal of the growing amount of personal information vehicles collect, store, and transmit.\u201d\nQuiet since 2018\nTuesday\u2019s post is the agency's first public comment on connected cars since 2018 aside from a short release advising consumers to wipe their data from rental cars last year. It comes at a time when U.S. senators are publicly pressuring the agency to take action against automakers for data privacy violations.\nIn addition to the warning about the use of geolocation data, the agency cautioned that companies with access to customers\u2019 sensitive data \u201cmust ensure that the data is used only for the reasons they collected that information.\u201d\nThe post then cited the FTC\u2019s recent settlement with BetterHelp, a company offering online counseling, which shared customers\u2019 email addresses and information gleaned from health questionnaires with third parties who used it for advertising.\nThe agency also referenced its recent settlement with Rite Aid, which it went after for allegedly using faulty facial recognition technology to identify problem customers. The blog post said industry should note that case because it underscores that \u201cfirms do not have the free license to monetize people\u2019s information beyond purposes needed to provide their requested product or service, and firms shouldn\u2019t let business model incentives outweigh the need for meaningful privacy safeguards.\u201d\nData minimization also was a focus of the blog post, which said that the best way for companies to ensure they do not harm consumers by improperly using their data is to not collect it in the first place.\nThe car data privacy issue has been a focus for consumer advocates in recent years. Matt Schwartz, a policy analyst at Consumer Reports, said his organization has urged the FTC to investigate how automakers collect and share driver behavior data with insurers and data brokers.\n\"Consumers deserve to use their vehicles without feeling their every move is being tracked or used against them,\u201d Schwartz said.\nSuzanne Smalley\nis a reporter covering privacy, disinformation and cybersecurity policy for The Record.

unauthenticated attackers that can access the HNAP port to gain elevated privileges and run commands as root,\" reads SSD's disclosure.\n\"By combining an authentication bypass with command execution the device can be completely compromised.\"\nAccessing the Home Network Administration Protocol (HNAP) port on the D-Link DIR-X4860 router is relatively straightforward in most cases, as it's usually HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443) accessible through the router's remote management interface.\nExploitation process\nThe SSD analysts have shared step-by-step exploitation instructions for the issues they discovered, making a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit now publicly available.\nThe attack begins with a specially crafted HNAP login request to the router's management interface, which includes a parameter named 'PrivateLogin' set to \"Username\" and a username of \"Admin\".\nThe router responds with a challenge, a cookie, and a public key, and these values are used to generate a valid login password for the \"Admin\" account.\nA follow-up login request with the HNAP_AUTH header and the generated LoginPassword is sent to the target device, essentially bypassing authentication.\nWith authenticated access, the attacker then exploits a command injection vulnerability in the 'SetVirtualServerSettings' function via a specially crafted request.\nThe vulnerable 'SetVirtualServerSettings' function processes the 'LocalIPAddress' parameter without proper sanitization, allowing the injected command to execute in the context of the router's operating system.\nSSD says it has contacted D-Link three times to share its findings with the router maker over the past 30 days, but all attempts to notify them have been unsuccessful, leaving the flaws currently unfixed.\nBleepingComputer has also reached out to D-Link with a related request, and we are still waiting for a comment.\nUntil a security firmware update is made available, users of the DIR-X4860 should disable the device's remote access management interface to prevent exploitation.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

On Tuesday, the company announced big new AI-powered changes to the world's dominant search engine at I/O, Google's annual conference for developers. From a report: With the new features, Google is positioning Search as more than a way to simply find websites. Instead, the company wants people to use its search engine to directly get answers and help them with planning events and brainstorming ideas. \"[With] generative AI, Search can do more than you ever imagined,\" wrote Liz Reid, vice president and head of Google Search, in a blog post. \"So you can ask whatever's on your mind or whatever you need to get done -- from researching to planning to brainstorming -- and Google will take care of the legwork.\"\nGoogle's changes to Search, the primary way that the company makes money, are a response to the explosion of generative AI ever since OpenAI's ChatGPT released at the end of 2022. [...] Starting today, Google will show complete AI-generated answers in response to most search queries at the top of the results page in the US. Google first unveiled the feature a year ago at Google I/O in 2023, but so far, anyone who wanted to use the feature had to sign up for it as part of the company's Search Labs platform that lets people try out upcoming features ahead of their general release. Google is now making AI Overviews available to hundreds of millions of Americans, and says that it expects it to be available in more countries to over a billion people by the end of the year.\nGoogle's changes to Search, the primary way that the company makes money, are a response to the explosion of generative AI ever since OpenAI's ChatGPT released at the end of 2022.

As expected, Adobe and Microsoft have released their standard bunch of security patches. Take a break from your regular activities and join us as we review the details of their latest advisories. If you\u2019d rather watch the full video recap covering the entire release, you can check it out here:\nApple Patches for May 2024\nApple kicked off the May release cycle with a group of updates for their macOS and iOS platforms. Most notable is a fix for CVE-2024-23296 for iOS 16.7.8 and iPadOS 16.7.8. This vulnerability is a memory corruption issue in RTKit that could allow attackers to bypass kernel memory protections. The initial patch was released back in March, but Apple noted additional fixes would be coming, and here they are. This bug is reported as being under active attack, so if you\u2019re using a device with an affected OS, make sure you get the update.\nApple also patched the Safari bug demonstrated at Pwn2Own Vancouver by Master of Pwn Winner Manfred Paul.\nAdobe Patches for May 2024\nFor May, Adobe released eight patches addressing 37 CVEs in Adobe Acrobat and Reader, Illustrator, Substance3D Painter, Adobe Aero, Substance3D Designer, Adobe Animate, FrameMaker, and Dreamweaver. Eight of these vulnerabilities were reported through the ZDI program. The update for Reader should be the priority. It includes multiple Critical-rated bugs that are often used by malware and ransomware gangs. While none of these bugs are under active attack, it is likely some will eventually be exploited. The patch for Illustrator also addresses a couple of Critical-rated bugs that could result in arbitrary code execution. The patch for Aero (an augmented reality authoring and publishing tool) fixes a single code execution bug. Unless I\u2019m mistaken, this is the first Adobe patch for this product.\nThe fix for Adobe Animate fixes eight bugs, seven of which result in Critical-rated code execution. The patch for FrameMaker also fixes several code execution bugs. These are classic open-and-own bugs that require user interaction. That\u2019s the same for the single bug fixed in Dreamweaver. The patch for Substance 3D Painter addresses four bugs, two of which are rated Critical, while the patch for Substance 3D Designer fixes a single Important-rated memory leak.\nNone of the bugs fixed by Adobe this month are listed as publicly known or under active attack at the time of release. Adobe categorizes these updates as a deployment priority rating of 3.\nMicrosoft Patches for April 2024\nThis month, Microsoft released 59 CVEs in Windows and Windows Components; Office and Office Components; .NET Framework and Visual Studio; Microsoft Dynamics 365; Power BI; DHCP Server; Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based); and Windows Mobile Broadband. If you include the third-party CVEs being documented this month, the CVE count comes to 63. A total of two of these bugs came through the ZDI program. As with last month, none of the bugs disclosed at Pwn2Own Vancouver are fixed with this release. With Apple and VMware fixing the vulnerabilities reported during the event, Microsoft stands alone as the only vendor not to produce patches from the contest.\nOf the new patches released today, only one is rated Critical, 57 are rated Important, and one is rated Moderate in severity. This release is roughly a third of the size of last month\u2019s, so hopefully that\u2019s a sign that a huge number of fixes in a single month isn\u2019t going to be a regular occurrence.\nTwo of the CVEs released today are listed as under active attack, and one other is listed as publicly known at the time of the release. Microsoft doesn\u2019t provide any indication of the volume of attacks, but the DWM Core bug appears to me to be more than a targeted attack. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the more interesting updates for this month, starting with the DWM bug currently exploited in the wild:\n- CVE-2024-30051 \u2013 Windows DWM Core Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\nThis bug allows attackers to escalate the SYSTEM on affected systems. These types of bugs are usually combined with a code execution bug to take over a target and are often used by ransomware. Microsoft credits four different groups for reporting the bug, which indicates the attacks are widespread. They also indicate the vulnerability is publicly known. Don\u2019t wait to test and deploy this update as exploits are likely to increase now that a patch is available to reverse engineer.\n- CVE-2024-30043 \u2013 Microsoft SharePoint Server Information Disclosure Vulnerability\nThis vulnerability was reported to Microsoft by ZDI researcher Piotr Bazyd\u0142o and represents an XML external entity injection (XXE) vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019. An authenticated attacker could use this bug to read local files with SharePoint Farm service account user privileges. They could also perform an HTTP-based server-side request forgery (SSRF), and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 perform NLTM relaying as the SharePoint Farm service account. Bugs like this show why info disclosure vulnerabilities shouldn\u2019t be ignored or deprioritized.\n- CVE-2024-30033 \u2013 Windows Search Service Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\nThis is another bug reported through the ZDI program and has a similar impact to the bug currently being exploited, although it manifests through a different mechanism. This is a link following bug in the Windows Search service. By creating a pseudo-symlink, an attacker could redirect a delete call to delete a different file or folder as SYSTEM. We discussed how this could be used to elevate privileges here. The delete happens when restarting the service. A low-privileged user can't restart the service directly. However, this could easily be combined with a bug that allows a low-privileged user to terminate any process by PID. After failure, the service will restart automatically, successfully triggering this vulnerability.\n- CVE-2024-30050 \u2013 Windows Mark of the Web Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\nWe don\u2019t normally detail Moderate-rated bugs, but this type of security feature bypass is quite in vogue with ransomware gangs right now. They zip their payload to bypass network and host-based defenses, they use a Mark of the Web (MotW) bypass to evade SmartScreen or Protected View in Microsoft Office. While we have no indication this bug is being actively used, we see the technique used often enough to call it out. Bugs like this one show why Moderate-rated bugs shouldn\u2019t be ignored or deprioritized.\nHere\u2019s the full list of CVEs released by Microsoft for May 2024:\nCVE | Title | Severity | CVSS |

vulnerability.\nThere\u2019s just one Critical-rated bug this month, and it deals with a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker could use this bug to execute arbitrary code in the context of the SharePoint Server. While permissions are needed for this to occur, any authorized user on the server has the needed level of permissions.\nLooking at the other RCE bugs, we see a lot of vulnerabilities in rarely used protocols. The Windows Mobile Broadband driver and the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) make up the bulk of this category. More notable are the two bugs in Hyper-V. One of these would allow an authenticated attacker to execute code on the host system. This would result in a guest-to-host escape, but Microsoft doesn\u2019t indicate what level the code execution occurs on the host OS. After a couple of months with many SQL-related fixes, there\u2019s just one this month. As with the previous bugs, you would need to connect to a malicious SQL server. The bug in Cryptographic Services requires a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) but could lead to a malicious certificate being imported onto the target system. The RCE bugs are rounded out with open-and-own style bugs in Excel and .NET and Visual Studio.\nMoving on to the elevation of privilege (EoP) patches in this month\u2019s release, almost all lead to SYSTEM-level code execution if an authenticated user runs specially crafted code. While there isn\u2019t a lot else to say about these bugs, they are often used by attackers to take over a system when combined with a code execution bug \u2013 like the Excel bug mentioned above. They convince a user to open a specially crafted Excel document that executes the EoP and takes over the system. The lone exception to this is the bug in the Brokering File System component. The vulnerability allows attackers to gain the ability to authenticate against a remote host using the current user\u2019s credentials. The attack could be launched from a low-privileged AppContainer, which would allow the attacker to execute code or access resources at a higher integrity level than that of the AppContainer execution environment.\nWe\u2019ve already discussed the MotW security feature bypass (SFB), and the only other SFB vulnerability receiving a fix this month is the MSHTML engine. Just when you thought you were safe from Internet Explorer, the Trident engine rears its ugly head. This bug allows an unauthenticated attacker to get code execution if they can convince a user to open a malicious document. The code execution occurs in the context of the user, so this is another reminder not to log on with Admin privileges unless you absolutely need to.\nThere are only seven information disclosure bugs receiving fixes this month, and we\u2019ve already covered the one in SharePoint. As usual, most of these vulnerabilities only result in info leaks consisting of unspecified memory contents. The bug in Power BI could result in the disclosing of \u201csensitive information,\u201d but Microsoft doesn\u2019t narrow down what type of \u201csensitive information\u201d could be leaked. Similarly, the bug in Deployment Services could leak \u201cfile contents.\u201d Microsoft provides no information on whether that\u2019s any arbitrary file contents or only specific files, so your guess is as good as mine.\nThe May release includes four spoofing bugs. The first is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) bug in Azure Migrate. There\u2019s not a straightforward patch for this one. You need the latest Azure Migrate Agent and ConfigManager updates. More info on how to do that can be found here. There are two spoofing bugs in Dynamics 365, but they read more like XSS bugs. The final spoofing bug addressed this month is in the Bing search engine.

Bu\u00dfgelder sind m\u00f6glich.\nDas im M\u00e4rz vom Bundestag beschlossene Digitale-Dienste-Gesetz (DDG) ist am Montag im Bundesgesetzblatt ver\u00f6ffentlicht worden und tritt damit an diesem Dienstag in Kraft. Zum Koordinator f\u00fcr Digitale Dienste (KDD) hat das Parlament eine neue unabh\u00e4ngige Stelle bei der Bundesnetzagentur bestimmt, die jetzt ihre Arbeit aufgenommen hat. Sie soll als zentrale Plattformaufsicht f\u00fcr Deutschland dienen.

Die Verordnung setzt zudem einheitliche Standards f\u00fcr den Schutz von Verbrauchern vor illegalen Produkten auf Online-Plattformen. Betroffen sind etwa soziale Netzwerke wie Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok und X, Suchmaschinen wie Google, App-Stores, Buchungsportale, Jobb\u00f6rsen und Cloud-Dienste.

Unterst\u00fctzen sollen den DSC die Landesmedienanstalten, die Bundeszentrale f\u00fcr Kinder- und Jugendmedienschutz sowie der Bundesbeauftragte f\u00fcr den Datenschutz.\nZudem arbeitet der KDD mit Strafverfolgungsbeh\u00f6rden wie dem Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) zusammen. B\u00fcrgerrechtler bef\u00fcrchten, dass es zu einer \"Datenflut\" an die Zentrale Meldestelle beim BKA kommt. Denn Plattformen m\u00fcssen dieser beim Verdacht auf Straftaten, die eine Gefahr f\u00fcr das Leben oder die Sicherheit von Personen darstellen, bestimmte Nutzerdaten \u00fcbermitteln. Der Bundestag versuchte diese Bedenken mit der Vorgabe abzumildern, dass das BKA von 2025 an j\u00e4hrlich der Regierung Bericht \u00fcber die eingegangenen Hinweise erstatten muss. Darin sollen Art und Anzahl der gemeldeten Straftaten erfasst sein.\nDer DSC zertifiziert ferner Organisationen, die sich f\u00fcr den Status eines vertrauensw\u00fcrdigen Hinweisgebers (\"trusted flaggers\") bewerben. Diese sollen \u00fcber besonderes Fachwissen zur Identifikation illegaler Inhalte verf\u00fcgen und diese Plattformbetreibern bevorzugt melden k\u00f6nnen. Der KDD wird sich zudem f\u00fcr die Zulassung von Stellen zur au\u00dfergerichtlichen Streitbeilegung k\u00fcmmern. Forschern kann er auf Antrag Zugang zu Daten sehr gro\u00dfer Plattformen gew\u00e4hren.\nWissing: Zunehmender Diskursverrohung Einhalt gebieten\nMit dem Inkrafttreten des DDG wird die Bundesnetzagentur ferner mit der Durchsetzung der Verordnung zur F\u00f6rderung von Fairness und Transparenz f\u00fcr gewerbliche Nutzer von Online-Vermittlungsdiensten von 2020 betraut. Online-Marktpl\u00e4tze, Buchungsportale, App-Stores, Preisvergleichsportale & Co. m\u00fcssen demnach etwa die wesentlichen Parameter ihres Rankings offenlegen.\n\"Nie war eine starke Plattformaufsicht so wichtig wie heute\", betonte Bundesdigitalminister Volker Wissing (FDP). \"Wir sehen eine zusehende Verrohung des Diskurses im Netz.\" Auch die Plattformbetreiber tr\u00fcgen daf\u00fcr mit Verantwortung und m\u00fcssten gegen rechtswidrige Inhalte vorgehen. Das neue Team bei der Regulierungsbeh\u00f6rde werde nun \"auf die Einhaltung unserer gemeinsamen europ\u00e4ischen Regeln pochen und bei Verst\u00f6\u00dfen Verfahren einleiten\". Die zivilgesellschaftliche Organisation AlgorithmWatch begr\u00fc\u00dfte den Ansatz, \"auch wenn es fast zu sp\u00e4t ist f\u00fcr eine wirksame Anwendung f\u00fcr die EU-Wahl im Juni\". Mit dem DDG k\u00f6nnten Plattformen nun besser in die Haftung genommen werden, was in diesem Super-Wahljahr essenziell sei.\n(olb)", "hash": "537436afa5ba8c8f856558d4352fe87c0ade93cb0cc3dd370ec289462a7faf8e", "id": "c84d3e45-bcfd-408f-b2b5-ad573fd2cc52", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Kampf-gegen-illegale-Inhalte-Bundesnetzagentur-nimmt-jetzt-Beschwerden-entgegen-9718162.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-14T17:18:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "a083676c-1ff1-40bf-88e0-928a4eaa8749", "title": "Kampf gegen illegale Inhalte: Bundesnetzagentur nimmt jetzt Beschwerden entgegen"}], "tags": {"AlgorithmWatch": {"name": "AlgorithmWatch", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "BKA": {"name": "BKA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Bundeskriminalamt": {"name": "Bundeskriminalamt", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "DDG": {"name": "DDG", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "DSA": {"name": "DSA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "DSC": {"name": "DSC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Deutschland": {"name": "Deutschland", "tag_type": "Country"}, "FDP": {"name": "FDP", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "KDD": {"name": "KDD", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Volker Wissing": {"name": "Volker Wissing", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Wissing": {"name": "Wissing", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Kampf gegen illegale Inhalte: Bundesnetzagentur nimmt jetzt Beschwerden entgegen"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-15T09:15:53.361467", "id": "b0173366-1362-4fe6-a905-8918159f7394", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "6"}], "created": "2024-05-14T17:14:39", "id": "572ae211-f796-4e66-9a27-9ae5603aae33", "news_items": [{"author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "content": "MITRE announced the public release of its EMB3D threat model for embedded devices used in various industries (i.e. Automotive, healthcare, and manufacturing), including critical infrastructure.\nThe threat model provides a knowledge base of cyber threats to embedded devices.

Die neue Version wurde zusammen mit dem iPad Pro M4 und dem iPad Air M2 vorgestellt.\nDabei stechen vor allem die sogenannten Session Players und der Stem Splitter hervor. Bei den Session Players handelt es sich um KI-generierte Schlagzeuger, Keyboarder und Bassisten, die beispielsweise eine vorhandene Gesangsspur auswerten und passend dazu spielen. Mit mehreren Parametern kann das Spiel der jeweiligen Musikkomponenten vom Nutzer weiter angepasst werden, sodass etwa S\u00e4nger sich eine eigene kleine Band erschaffen k\u00f6nnen.\nLesen Sie auch\nIm Test: Apples Audiosoftware Logic Pro f\u00fcrs iPad\nNachtr\u00e4glich Mitschnitte aufsplitten\nDer Stem Splitter funktioniert in die umgekehrte Richtung.

Die KI trennt dazu Gesang, Schlagzeug, Bass und andere Instrumente. In einfachen F\u00e4llen kann etwa der Sound der Gitarren niedriger geregelt werden, w\u00e4hrend die restliche Musik gleich laut bleibt. M\u00f6glich ist aber zum Beispiel auch, dass eine Gesangsspur extrahiert und mithilfe des Session Players um eine komplett neue KI-generierte Band erweitert wird.\nNeben diesen finden sich zahlreiche weitere neue Funktionen im Update, etwa in der Studioassistenz, eine globale Akkordspur oder ein Feature namens ChromaGlow, mit dem Ger\u00e4usche und Tonbeschaffenheit analoger Aufnahmeger\u00e4te hinzugef\u00fcgt werden k\u00f6nnen.\nSystemvoraussetzungen und Preis\nMusikprojekte k\u00f6nnen laut Apple zwischen der iPad- und Mac-Version transferiert werden. Auf dem iPad wird ein Ger\u00e4t vorausgesetzt, das mindestens den A12 Bionic Chip und iPadOS 17.4 installiert hat. Einige Funktionen ben\u00f6tigen ein iPad mit M1. Es werden etwa ein Gigabyte Speicherplatz f\u00fcr die App und bis zu 31 Gigabyte f\u00fcr die Sound Library ben\u00f6tigt. Auf dem Mac muss macOS 13.5 oder neuer installiert sein.

Zach Nunn, a 44-year-old Iowa Air National Guard intelligence squadron commander who likely arrived in Congress with more cyber experience than any other new member in history, has quickly emerged as a leading contender to succeed the recently retired Mike Gallagher as a leading House Republican voice on cyber policy.\nIn the 16 months since he took office, Nunn has rolled out a steady stream of legislation and policy proposals to address the security implications of artificial intelligence and the cyberthreats facing America\u2019s critical infrastructure. He has raised cyber issues during hearings of the House Financial Services Committee, where he sits on the national security subcommittee, and he has tried to get his colleagues to focus on the digital security challenges facing rural communities, which make up a significant portion of his constituency in Iowa\u2019s 3rd District.\nSucceeding Gallagher as Republicans\u2019 cyber champion will be a daunting task. Gallagher not only chaired the House\u2019s select committee on China and the Armed Services cyber subcommittee but also co-led the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, which produced dozens of reforms. In a recent interview, Nunn said Gallagher\u2019s departure left \u201ca real void\u201d on cyber policy, and he pledged to work with colleagues to carry Gallagher\u2019s vision forward.\n\u201cI want to be a net help,\u201d Nunn told Recorded Future News, \u201cto ensure cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, [and] the threat posed by near-peer adversaries stays at the forefront of our national security conversations.\u201d\nWatching others wake up to the issue\nFew lawmakers focusing on cyber issues bring so much government experience to the task. Before entering politics as an Iowa state legislator, Nunn served from 2008 to 2011 as the senior counterintelligence officer for cyber issues at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and from 2011 to 2013 as a director of cyber policy at the National Security Council.\nNunn had a front-row seat to the government\u2019s evolving approach to cybersecurity, as increasing nation-state threats forced policymakers to realize the power of the internet to cause chaos. This was the era of Iran\u2019s devastating cyberattack on Saudi Aramco and North Korea\u2019s stunning breach of Sony Pictures. Nunn said these attacks showed the White House how cyber could \u201chave a direct impact on economies, on the ability to operate in the kinetic space, as well as the diplomatic space.\u201d\nNunn also watched as China began its push for emerging-technology dominance through companies like the telecom giant Huawei. China and other U.S. rivals \u201cwere coming online with infrastructure that was going to fundamentally change where we were\u201d geopolitically, Nunn said, by helping those adversaries \u201cinfluence us and actually control access to a lot of our data.\u201d\nAt the NSC, Nunn tried to \u201cbring the federal government on board with what the private sector was experiencing on a daily basis,\u201d so policymakers understood that nation-state cyber threats had grown beyond espionage against defense contractors. \u201cWe were going to have to defend the entire internet,\u201d he said.\nDeterrence and dominance\nNunn\u2019s vision for bolstering U.S. cybersecurity has two major components: convincing adversaries that they will pay a price for cyberattacks and establishing an unshakable foothold in markets for cutting-edge technologies.\nNunn said he\u2019s disappointed with President Joe Biden\u2019s approach to deterrence. \u201cThe administration today has lacked that ability to prosecute, to identify and ultimately [to] deter threat actors who are posing very big risks to everybody from our national defense entities down to our hometown schools,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDeterrence in cyberspace is possible,\u201d Nunn added, but for it to work, the U.S. has to \u201cdeploy countermeasures effectively.\u201d Translation: Biden needs to step up the use of U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s offensive capabilities, which Nunn has seen firsthand during his Air Force service.\nNunn at the Iowa State Fair in August 2023. Image: Gage Skidmore / CC BY-SA 2.0\nNunn also wants the U.S. to partner with other countries on aggressive pushback to cyberattacks. He drew an analogy to the Western coalition that helped Israel fend off an Iranian missile barrage last month. \u201cWe've got to be able to do the same thing in cyberspace, oftentimes with folks who we wouldn't be able to work on maybe any other issue with.\u201d\nEqually pressing is the need for the U.S. and its Western allies to out-compete China in the race to deploy 5G wireless networks, build powerful AI models, develop quantum computers, and harness other emerging technologies. \u201cFor the United States to be a leader in the infrastructure of this is absolutely critical,\u201d Nunn said, referring to this as \u201cowning the battlespace itself.\u201d\nThe threats in that battlespace are growing more diverse every day. \u201cWe\u2019re now looking at things like very advanced blockchains,\u201d Nunn said. \u201cChina is moving directly in an area which not only is going to compete with us, but they may end up being the only viable large-scale actor who can operate in this space.\u201d\nNunn and Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) co-introduced a bill last year to prohibit the government from using Chinese-owned blockchain infrastructure. China\u2019s dominance of this technology is \u201ca thousand times worse than whatever China is doing at TikTok,\u201d Nunn said.\nSpanberger called Nunn \u201ca strong partner in addressing threats to our economic and national security\u201d and said she was proud to work with him \u201cto keep Americans\u2019 data out of the hands of our adversaries, strengthen our nation\u2019s defenses against threats from maligned uses of artificial intelligence, and keep our nation competitive.\u201d\nFocused on vulnerable infrastructure\nIn addition to advocating a more aggressive deterrence strategy, Nunn is also pushing new approaches to defending critical sectors of the U.S. economy. He\u2019s proposed more bills to that effect than perhaps any other first-term lawmaker.\nIn April 2023, three months after a cyberattack shut down Des Moines public schools, Nunn introduced a bill that would expand the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)\u2019s resources and guidance for schools and centralize information about cyber threats to education systems. Nunn said he was disturbed by the long-term ripple effects of the Des Moines breach on hundreds of student victims: \u201cThat is going to echo out throughout those kids\u2019 lives.\u201d\nThe more than 150,000 public water systems in the U.S. also face increasing cyber threats, as recent Iranian and Russian attacks have demonstrated. Last June, Nunn and Rep. Don Davis (D-NC) proposed legislation that would task the Department of Agriculture\u2019s local community support teams with offering cyber aid to rural water facilities.\nIn rural communities, \u201chaving a water tower is a luxury,\u201d Nunn said, \u201clet alone having a [chief information security officer] who sits in town being able to effectively combat a cyber threat.\u201d\nNunn wants to turn land-grant universities into technical resources for local communities, modeled on Iowa State University\u2019s large USDA-funded cybersecurity engineering program.\nThe food and agriculture sector also faces major economic and national security risks from cyberattacks, and Nunn wants to increase the government\u2019s focus on those threats. Shortly after introducing his water bill last June, Nunn proposed legislation that would create \u201cRegional Agriculture Cybersecurity Centers\u201d at U.S. universities to conduct research, monitor threats and design custom technology to help protect farms, processing plants and other facilities from hackers intent on tainting food or stealing trade secrets.\nUnlike some other Republicans, Nunn is open to new federal regulations covering these and other critical infrastructure sectors. \u201cWe have so many requirements for getting a home loan today,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have none of the comparable cybersecurity requirements for food supply distribution or water access throughout the country.\u201d\nEven so, Nunn warned against enacting sprawling new rules that would \u201ccrush\u201d small infrastructure operators with paperwork and distract them from real security improvements.\nWorried about AI \u2014 and Biden 'overreach'\nNo lawmaker can focus on cybersecurity today without a plan for addressing the myriad opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence. In March, Nunn and Spanberger introduced the Artificial Intelligence Practices, Logistics, Actions and Necessities (AI PLAN) Act, which would require key departments to collaborate on a plan to combat AI-powered misinformation, election interference and financial crimes.\nNunn said he was worried about rapidly proliferating AI-fueled hoaxes, like fake kidnapping scams and false reports of explosions at government buildings. \u201cThis is the kind of attack vector that is coming online with a low barrier to entry, but a highly effective capability.\u201d\nStill, in discussing the Biden administration\u2019s AI safety agenda, Nunn echoed other Republicans who have criticized the president's use of the 1950 Defense Production Act to compel AI developers to report the results of their security testing. The DPA is meant for wartime, he said, and the U.S. is not \u201cin an artificial intelligence war frame right now.\u201d\nNunn said he\u2019s concerned about \u201coverreach coming out of Biden's bureaucracy,\u201d in which officials are \u201cwriting rules of the road when they don\u2019t even know what the road itself looks like.\u201d\nThe U.S. should provide \u201ca long runway for the tech innovators,\u201d Nunn said, \u201cbecause our adversaries have no guardrails in this space.

Ein einziges Modell soll Audio, Text und Bild verstehen. Erste Funktionen sind schon ausgespielt.\nOpenAI hat mit GPT-4o einen Vielesk\u00f6nner angek\u00fcndigt. Das Omnimodell f\u00fcr K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz, so OpenAIs Bezeichnung \u2013 daher auch das \"o\" \u2013 soll Audio, Text und Bild in einem Schwung verstehen k\u00f6nnen. Die neuen Funktionen erstrecken sich \u00fcber Gesangsk\u00fcnste der KI bis hin zu Live-Videochats. Letztere werden erst in den kommenden Wochen ausgerollt. Doch die Auffrischung der Text- und Bildkompetenz ist bereits sp\u00fcrbar.\nF\u00fcr die Bedienung von GPT-4 kamen mehrere Modelle zum Einsatz, die den Ton in Text und schlie\u00dflich die Antwort der KI wieder in Ton verwandelt haben. Teilweise gehen \u00fcber diese doppelte \u00dcbersetzung Informationen verloren oder die KI interpretiert sie falsch. So macht GPT-4 aus den ersten Textzeilen von \"Toxicity\" (System of a Down) mal eben das St\u00fcck \"Losing my religion\" (R.E.M.). Beim neuen GTP-4o soll alles \u00fcber ein Modell funktionieren. Dadurch gehe weniger Information verloren, sagt OpenAI.\nEntzifferung von Bildern f\u00e4llt gemischt aus\nEin erster Test des neuen Modells ist derzeit vorerst nur f\u00fcr die Text- und Bildverarbeitung m\u00f6glich. Dabei versteht GPT-4o gleicherma\u00dfen wie GPT-4 die Zeichnung eines Tic-Tac-Toe-Spiels, empfiehlt aber unterschiedliche n\u00e4chste Z\u00fcge. Klingt die Antwort von GPT-4 noch recht analytisch, scheint GPT-4o gewinnen zu wollen: Es schl\u00e4gt den aus seiner Sicht kl\u00fcgsten Zug f\u00fcr einen Sieg vor.\nGPT-4o entziffert ohne Probleme Handschriften. Auf die Frage \"Wo ist der Rechtschreibfehler?\" findet es in einem korrekt geschriebenen Text auch einen \u2013 und schl\u00e4gt als L\u00f6sung genau das vor, was schon auf dem Blatt geschrieben steht. Ein \"Wo bin ich?\" anhand eines Fotos funktioniert auch gut, solange das Bild kleine Hinweise \u2013 etwa ein Firmenlogo \u2013 auf die Umgebung enth\u00e4lt. Bei einem historischen Brief in S\u00fctterlin mit leicht verblasster Tinte tun sich beide Modelle schwer und raten, sich an mit historischer deutscher Schrift erfahrene Personen zu wenden.\nGibt man GPT-4o ein Poster eines Jazzmusikers und fragt, wer die abgebildete Person ist, mutma\u00dft es anhand eines Schriftzugs \"Think different\" und einer Trompete, die es als Saxophon interpretiert, auf die Apple-Kampagne. In einer ersten Variante nennt es zielsicher John Coltrane. Fragt man erneut, lautet die Antwort anders: Es k\u00f6nne keine Personen auf Fotos erkennen, aber aus dem Kontext k\u00f6nne es ein bekannter Jazzmusiker wie John Coltrane sein. Um es genauer zu erfahren, r\u00e4t es, die Kampagne nachzuschlagen.\nEine n\u00e4here Aufnahme interpretiert der Chatbot wiederum richtig und identifiziert Miles Davis. Hier erfasst es auch den Gespr\u00e4chsverlauf, und dass das zweite Foto ein Ausschnitt aus dem ersten ist. GPT-4 hingegen vermutet eine Fotocollage eines bekannten amerikanischen K\u00fcnstlers. Hier scheint GPT-4o seinem Vorg\u00e4nger trotz des ersten Fehlschlags deutlich \u00fcberlegen, passte trotz der falschen Vermutung zumindest der Kontext der Apple-Kampagne.\nErkl\u00e4rungen im zweiten oder dritten Versuch deutlich besser\nDie Kontextspeicherung wie bei dem Poster funktioniert auch \u00fcber mehrere Interaktionen hinweg. Verr\u00e4t man der KI beispielsweise am Anfang eines Gespr\u00e4chs sein Lieblingstier, erinnert es sich sp\u00e4ter wieder daran.\nBei der Erkl\u00e4rung komplexerer Sachverhalte, etwa der Relativit\u00e4tstheorie, bringen Zweit- oder Drittversuche deutlich bessere Ergebnisse als der erste Aufschlag. Bittet man GPT-4o, seine eigene Erkl\u00e4rung noch einmal zu erkl\u00e4ren, wirft es im ersten Versuch einen nahezu identischen Text aus. L\u00e4sst man es neu antworten, gliedert es seinen eigenen Text \u00fcbersichtlich in mehrere Elemente und erkl\u00e4rt diese einzeln. Die Interpretation einfacher Songtexte funktioniert da deutlich besser. Hier spucken alle drei Versionen (GPT-4o, GPT-4 und GPT-3.5) f\u00fcr \"Rock Show\" (Blink182) brauchbare Ergebnisse aus.\nWortgewandt \u2013 ja, sprachlich sicher \u2013 nein\nErstaunlich durchmischt fallen die Ergebnisse bei Witzen aus. Versteht das Modell das sprachliche Augenzwinkern bei \"Was ist orange und l\u00e4uft durch den Wald? Eine Wanderine\", versteht es die Bedeutung des exakten Worts bei Flachwitzen offenbar nicht immer. So schl\u00e4gt es vor \"Warum k\u00f6nnen Geister so schlecht l\u00fcgen? Weil man durch sie hindurchsieht\". Der inhaltliche Unterschied zum korrekten \"Weil sie durchschaubar sind\", macht den sprachlichen Witz und damit eine der Kernkompetenzen von Flachwitzen hier zunichte.\nAuf den ersten Blick ist GPT-4o in mancherlei Hinsicht durchaus brauchbarer als sein Vorg\u00e4nger. Offenbar versteht es Kontext besser, verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber aktuellere Trainingsdaten und kann teils auch Bilder interpretieren. Spannend werden auch die weiteren Funktionen, die OpenAI in den kommenden Wochen ausrollen will. Die angek\u00fcndigten Funktionen einer besseren Spracheingabe k\u00f6nnten ebenfalls eine massive Erleichterung sein. Die Live-\u00dcbersetzung eines Gespr\u00e4chs in eine andere Sprache resultiert in GPT-4 sp\u00e4testens nach wenigen Wortwechseln zu einer Verwirrung bei der KI, die den Faden verliert. In den Ank\u00fcndigungsvideos von OpenAI funktioniert die neue Version hingegen regelrecht als Dolmetscherin \u2013 f\u00fcr Reisen in fremdsprachige L\u00e4nder ein Traum.\nAuch die Ank\u00fcndigung der Videofunktion weckt Erwartungen, schlie\u00dflich soll die KI live auf die Kamera zugreifen und beispielsweise die Umgebung interpretieren. GPT-4o kann laut der Ank\u00fcndigungsvideos au\u00dferdem mit anderen KIs sprechen, singen und live mathematische Probleme erkl\u00e4ren und l\u00f6sen. Ob dies eine neue Nachhilfefunktion sein kann oder die Kamerafunktion k\u00fcnftig als Tourguide dient, bleibt abzuwarten. Die neuen Funktionen d\u00fcrften zudem die Debatte \u00fcber Datenschutz und Urheberrechte wieder anfachen.\n(are)", "hash": "9e7a78955771336e1ff6f66b23df5ebbe36e714cf8d3fa60da9b4cfe884db99c", "id":

Darunter sind die ersten Modelle des Herstellers mit dem Betriebssystem TiVo.\nNico Jurran\n-\nVor zwei Jahren trat der US-Konzern Xperi (hierzulande vor allem beannt f\u00fcr sein Soundformat DTS) mit dem TV-Betriebssystem \"TiVo OS\" auch auf dem europ\u00e4ischen Markt gegen Android TV, Fire TV und Roku sowie die propriet\u00e4ren Systeme von Samsung und LG an. Erster Partner war dabei Vestel, der mittlerweile Fernseher mit dem OS unter seinen Marken JVC und Telefunken vertreibt.\nHeute k\u00fcndigte nun auch der japanische Hersteller Panasonic an, k\u00fcnftig in Europa Fernseher mit TiVo zu vertreiben. Konkret wird auf den kommenden LED-Modellen W60A und S45/S40 TiVo laufen. Allerdings setzt der TV-Hersteller weiterhin auch eine Multi-OS-Strategie. So nutzen etwa die Modelle W95A und W90A als Spitzenmodelle unter Panasonics LED-TVs der neuen Generation Amazons Fire TV als Betriebssystem. Dies gilt auch f\u00fcr das kommende OLED-Modell Z90A. Auf den OLED-Topmodellen wird wiederum Panasonics eigenes TV-OS laufen.\nVon Android TV beziehungsweise Google TV, das auf aktuellen TV-Modellen des Unternehmens noch vertreten ist, ist interessanterweise in der Ank\u00fcndigung nicht mehr die Rede.\nSchwieriges Gesch\u00e4ft\nPhilips hatte Ende Januar angek\u00fcndigt, seinen LCD-TVs ein neues Betriebssystem namens Titan OS.zu spendieren. Hintergrund des Umstiegs war, dass s\u00e4mtliche Werbeeinnahmen auf dem Homescreen an den Besitzer des Betriebssystems gehen \u2013 und der TV-Hersteller dieses Gesch\u00e4ft nicht nur Google \u00fcberlassen wollte. Auch Samsung und LG seit langem mit Tizen respektive WebOS eigene Betriebssysteme, w\u00e4hrend Philips und Sony bislang auf Android TV respektive Google TV angewiesen waren.\nF\u00fcr TV-Hersteller ist es aber eine echte Herausforderung, eine eigene TV-Plattform zu unterhalten. Schlie\u00dflich geht es nicht nur darum, eine attraktive Bedienoberfl\u00e4che zu schaffen. Der TV-Hersteller muss auch die Dienste davon \u00fcberzeugen, das System zu unterst\u00fctzen. Welche Verz\u00f6gerungen dabei auftreten k\u00f6nnen, zeigte sich gerade bei Panasonic: Das Unternehmen brachte erst im September 2021 eine TV-App f\u00fcr Disney+ auf seine Ger\u00e4te \u2013 mehr als ein Jahr nach dem Deutschlandstart des Dienstes.\nAuf den ersten Blick f\u00e4llt bei TiVo OS auf, dass dem TV-Hersteller bereits auf der Startseite erm\u00f6glicht wird, sein Branding unterzubringen. Laut Xperi ist dies ein wichtiger Punkt f\u00fcr TV-Hersteller, die bei der Nutzung von Android TV und Fire OS komplett in den Hintergrund gedr\u00e4ngt w\u00fcrden.\nBlick auf TiVo OS\nDie Oberfl\u00e4che von TiVo OS wirkt sehr aufger\u00e4umt, was Nutzern gefallen d\u00fcrfte, die beispielsweise dem doch recht \u00fcberladenen Fire OS nichts abgewinnen k\u00f6nnen. Zu diesem Ansatz passt, dass der Anwender konkret festlegen kann, welche Dienste man abonniert hat, um keine Werbung f\u00fcr Inhalte angezeigt zu bekommen, auf die er keinen Zugriff hat. Interessant f\u00fcr Amazon-Prime-Abonnenten: In den Einstellungen kann man einstellen, nur solche Filme und Serien angezeigt zu bekommen, die bei Amazon Prime Video ohne Zusatzkosten enthalten sind. Kauf- und Miettitel werden folglich gar nicht erst angezeigt.\nAls besonders interessant stellte sich bei Vorf\u00fchrungen die Sprachsteuerung heraus, da TiVo OS einige Features bietet, die nicht oder nicht in diesem Umfang bei den Konkurrenzprodukten verf\u00fcgbar sind. Ein Punkt sind dabei Nachfragen: Hat man sich beispielsweise mit \"Zeige Actionfilme\" eine Auswahl mit Actionstreifen anzeigen lassen, kann man das Suchergebnis mit \"Nur Filme mit Sylvester Stallone\" auf Filme mit einem Schauspieler beschr\u00e4nken lassen. Mit einem Befehl wie \"Nur Filme aus den 2000ern\" ist eine weitere Filterung m\u00f6glich. Ebenso kann man gleich sagen: \"Zeige mir Actionfilme aus den 2000ern mit Sylvester Stallone\".\n(nij)", "hash": "19ba1efbd271912763ff880255af09d4b2a6266006cdacef4ceaa3d6fffda39d", "id": "5be0bd99-fad9-4c9e-8ef1-a435132a9f39", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Erste-Panasonic-TVs-mit-TiVo-Betriebssystem-9717990.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-14T17:03:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "ba2a6448-5191-47bb-8b74-7dd2e158f06b", "title": "Erste Panasonic-TVs mit TiVo-Betriebssystem"}], "tags": {"Android TV": {"name": "Android TV", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "DTS": {"name": "DTS", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Europa": {"name": "Europa", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Google TV": {"name": "Google TV", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "JVC": {"name": "JVC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Nico Jurran": {"name": "Nico Jurran", "tag_type": "PER"}, "OLED": {"name": "OLED", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Panasonic": {"name": "Panasonic", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Philips": {"name": "Philips", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Roku": {"name": "Roku", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Samsung": {"name": "Samsung", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Sony": {"name": "Sony", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Telefunken": {"name": "Telefunken", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "TiVo OS": {"name": "TiVo OS", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Z90A": {"name": "Z90A", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Erste Panasonic-TVs mit TiVo-Betriebssystem"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T17:15:18.644279", "id": "1395b8ea-085e-4d0c-85a5-4e33296ddd9d", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "10"}], "created": "2024-05-14T17:00:19", "id": "82592b21-68e3-4a91-94d6-4c98c5e99f57", "news_items": [{"author": "Arya Voronova", "content": "Today, we revisit another board from [Exentio] \u2013 a HDMI/DVI to LVDS transmitter for the Sony Vaio P display. This board is cool to review \u2013 it has a high-speed serial interface, a parallel interface, a healthy amount of power distribution that can be tricky to route, and many connectors to look over.\nI\u2019ve decided to show this review to you all because it demonstrates a PCB improvement concept we haven\u2019t yet touched upon, that you should absolutely know about when doing board layout. Plus, I get a chance to talk about connector choice considerations!\nThe board is lovely. It integrates the DPI-LVDS circuit we\u2019ve previously reviewed, but also a HDMI to parallel RGB chip from Texas Instruments, TFP401, a chip appreciated enough that even Adafruit has adapters with it. The fun thing about this chip is that it doesn\u2019t even handle EDID like the usual HDMI to RGB/LVDS chips you get on cheap Aliexpress boards. So, there\u2019s no firmware to take care of \u2013 it just receives a HDMI/DVI signal, converts it into parallel RGB, then converts that to LVDS, and off to the display it goes. The downside is that you have to provide your own EDID with an EEPROM, but that isn\u2019t that tricky.\nAgain, this is a two-layer board, and, again, I like this \u2013 fitting tracks to the smallest possible space is a respectable and enjoyable challenge. This board has absolutely done well by this challenge. I do see how this board could be routed in an even better way, however, and it could be way way cleaner as a result. For a start, rotating the chip would improve the odds a whole lot.\nThe Chip Gets Rotated\nWhen doing silicon layout, engineers generally try and make the resulting chip pinout as sensible as possible. There can be exceptions, of course. This rule means that there\u2019s usually a single easy way to lay out a chip, and a few hard ways. You have to look at the pinout, try to notice the pin groups, and see how they align with your peripherals. Ignore this at your own peril.\nThe TFP401 chip has HDMI on one side and parallel RGB pins on the other. This board, however, currently has the chip rotated in a way that disadvantages the layout. This is an easy mistake to do initially \u2013 thankfully, even when the design is already finished, rotating the chip and rerouting it can pay off!\nIf you reroute this kind of board, not only you are more likely to get a functioning board, considering the high-speed signals, you\u2019re also training yourself to distinguish good and subpar chip rotations as you\u2019d be rerouting. In other words, it\u2019s the kind of refactoring that makes you say \u201cwow, that was way easier than the first time around\u201d.\nLift, Clean Up, Rotate, Behold\nTo do the reroute, just, take the chip, \u201clift it up\u201d with M\nand move it off the board. See the grey thin wires? They\u2019re called ratsnest wires, and using them is the best way you can notice rotation issues. Seriously, the ratsnest wires are underrated in noticing such issues before they bite you. Let\u2019s clean the chip\u2019s surroundings up. First, see those capacitor groups? Move them away too, all the power pins are changing their locations anyway, we\u2019ll reposition them later.\nBox select the signal traces that previously went to the chip, and press `Shift+Del` to completely delete them from beginning to end \u2013 on this board, this is the quickest way to get to a quickly routable space. Every trace that went to the chip is now gone, and every unrelated trace stays. Make sure there\u2019s a healthy amount of space between the chip and the HDMI port, but also between it and the DPI-LVDS converter \u2013 more or less the same center position is fine here.\nLook at the picture above. Using the ratsnest wires, you can instantly notice which trace groups you will need to flip and which you won\u2019t. In this case, as you might notice, you will need to flip like, three out of four? No matter, because all of them will be easy, even the HDMI pairs.\nSpeaking about HDMI, before routing, I will replace the THT signal pin HDMI connector with an SMT signal pin one. They\u2019re way, way nicer to layout \u2013 the through-hole staggered pins mean that you have to run two of the diffpairs around the connector shell. Plus, they\u2019re cheaper and easier to source too. [Exentio] picked this connector for expected sturdiness and solderability, and that is a valid choice, I\u2019m just prioritizing ease of layout and easier sourcing.\nReroute Time\nWith HDMI, not only is the order flipped, but the pair polarity is also flipped. Still, there are multiple things you could do here. You could flip the connector onto the opposite side of the board, or use a HDMI connector that\u2019s flipped (harder to source but not impossible), or try to re-route the diffpairs as they are now. I\u2019ll do the last one, since it\u2019s the most fun one.\nHere\u2019s my take. This is draft routing, without any calculated trace impedance, because this is a 2-layer board and we\u2019re winging it. Still, I\u2019m trying to give this routing some love \u2013 not that HDMI would ever love me back, I just think that this board working on the first try is a good goal to strive for, and HDMI can be sensitive. Pair length is also kind of matched between the pairs \u2013 they\u2019re all 23 mm +- 2 mm, good enough. By the way, KiCad 8 has added a new feature where you can check track length by simply pressing 7 (8 for diffpairs) and then hovering over tracks \u2013 inter-pair length matching is now the easiest it\u2019s ever felt!\nNow, what\u2019s left is three bundles of parallel wires (R/G/B) and four individual tracks (EN/CLKIN/HSYNC/VSYNC) going to the DPI-LVDS chip. Since all four individual tracks are on the DPI-LVDS chip corners, I\u2019ve decided that the parallel RGB pairs will go in the middle and the tracks will go around them. The biggest problem is flipping the bundles \u2013 you can do that under the HDMI chip or under the LVDS chip, I did it under the HDMI chip because it felt like there was just enough space there.\nHere you can see how the three bundles progressed. They\u2019re nice and tight, with some ground fills between the separate bundles and accompanying the wires. I\u2019ve had to move the first bundle once to make room for flipping the last one, but other than that, things fit surprisingly nicely. The bundles don\u2019t intersect each other\u2019s paths, and that helps. If they did, I would probably consider rotating the DPI-LVDS chip together with the LVDS connector.\nThere are some other small tweaks too. I\u2019ve moved the EDID EEPROM towards the HDMI I2C header at the bottom, only leaving the HPD pullup near the HDMI connector. The near-connector position is also a valid choice, I just wanted to do via-less routing of I2C as much as possible, and moving the EEPROM helped. Oh, and I\u2019ve moved the LVDS connector to the right a bit \u2013 that let me route LVDS better, which, in turn, let me actually connect the DPI-LVDS chip\u2019s 3.3 V pins.\nPower Pin Routing\nThis is the thing you might get stuck on, at some point. The chip has whole four different groups of power pins \u2013 one direct 3.3 V input, and three separate 3.3 V inputs that you\u2019re supposed to feed through Pi filters, for a cleaner power supply for all your analog needs. Use the \u201c (~)` key to highlight all four power nets of the chip \u2013 here\u2019s how it will look.\nI\u2019d describe these as annoying, but they\u2019re still routable. First, break apart the nice cap groups for the four rails \u2013 they\u2019re nice visually, but they\u2019re not great for power delivery. Remember \u2013 one capacitor per IC power pin is the platonic ideal, and each of these capacitors has to actually be placed close to a power pin, with a short path to ground too.\nI started with the 3.3V feed, and then placed a couple of ferrites to nearby power rails. Then, I went through each of the power rails, starting with the simplest, pulling power tracks where it seemed viable. In the end, I could place all the ferrites near the actual 3.3V supply point. A 3.3V power plane could be fun on this board, and would probably be very much called for if we wanted to do FCC testing for this board, but for now, it\u2019s not required.\nLong story short, here\u2019s the \u201crest of the owl\u201d pictures. Remember \u2013 for power tracks, wherever you can make them thicker, make them thicker. They will drop all that less voltage, and they will look like dedicated power tracks, too. Also, don\u2019t forget about GND! Highlight the GND net, then make sure that each GND point has a via directly near it, going to the bottom layer ground plane, with ground now even more abundant than before.\nAfter this layout was done, there were only cosmetic fixes left. Things like trace keepout that I\u2019m still maintaining, feeding 3.3 V everywhere it was called for. I suppose I would add a 5 V to 3.3 V linear regulator footprint onto this board, just because it would make bringup much easier, but it\u2019s such a small change that it could even be bodged onto this PCB later with little hassle. This board is, all things considered, wonderfully hackable already.\nClosing Statement\nHere\u2019s the end result of the board re-layout. It\u2019s even cleaner than before, with improvements to both high-speed tracks and power distribution, and I hope it\u2019s been a fun example about rotating your chips properly, something you could reasonably overlook on a board of yours.\nAs an outro to this review, here\u2019s some good news. That DPI-LVDS board we\u2019ve reviewed last time? It works! Which means that the DPI and LVDS parts of this HDMI-LVDS board should also work. Nothing is fundamentally broken to the best of our perception, [Exentio] has designed a working RPi config, and, as such, one of the more challenging parts of the Sony Vaio rebuild design is now complete \u2013 we only need to tinker with the backlight now.\nAs usual, if you would like a design review for your board, submit a tip to us with [design review] in the title, linking to your board files.

Delivered daily or weekly right to your email inbox.\nDangerous Google Chrome Zero-Day Allows Sandbox Escape\nExploit code is circulating for CVE-2024-4761, disclosed less than a week after a similar security vulnerability was disclosed as being used in the wild.\nTara Seals, Managing Editor, News, Dark Reading\nMay 14, 2024\n4 Min Read\nSource: Kristoffer Tripplaar via Alamy Stock Photo\nGoogle has released an emergency security update for its Chrome browser, including a patch for a zero-day vulnerability that has exploit code released in the wild that could lead to data theft, lateral movement, malware implantation, and more.\nIt's the second zero-day that Google has patched in the past week, and the sixth for the year so far.\nThe latest update, to version 124.0.6367.207, includes a patch for CVE-2024-4761, a high-severity out-of-bounds write in Google's open source V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine (affecting Chromium browsers as well). It allows a remote attacker who has compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape (which means moving beyond the browser tab to pivot to other Web apps or the network) via a crafted HTML page.\nAn exploit \"makes it possible to manipulate parts of the memory which are allocated to more critical functions,\" allowing an attacker \"to write code to a part of the memory where it will be executed with permissions that the program and user should not have,\" according to a Malwarebytes overview of the bug.\nGoogle noted that exploit code exists but stopped short of saying that active exploitation is underway.\n\"An exploit exists for this vulnerability in the wild, and while Google suggests that they haven\u2019t seen active exploitation in the wild, the fact that an exploit exists suggests that this will soon commence,\" Casey Ellis, founder and chief strategy officer at Bugcrowd, wrote in an emailed statement.\nMeanwhile, four days ago, Google patched CVE-2024-4671, a use-after-free (UAF) flaw in Visuals in Google Chrome prior to version 124.0.6367.201. This one was being exploited in the wild before the patch was released, and it also allows a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.\n\"Exploitation is possible by getting the target to open a specific, specially crafted webpage, so the vulnerability is suitable for exploitation as a drive-by attack,\" according to Malwarebytes.\nWhile both bugs allow sandbox escape and require a compromise of the renderer process, it's unclear if the two are related. As usual, Google has declined to offer details on either vulnerability.\nSixth Chrome Zero-Day for 2024\nThe two vulnerabilities disclosed this week follow three other bugs revealed at Pwn2Own in March that were already being exploited: CVE-2024-2887 (type-confusion issue in WebAssembly); CVE-2024-2886 (UAF issue in WebCodecs); and CVE-2024-3159 (out-of-bounds memory access in V8).\nAnd in January, Google patched its first exploited zero-day of the year, CVE-2024-0519: an out-of-bounds memory access bug in the Chrome JavaScript engine.\nIn contrast, for the entirety of 2023, Mandiant, part of Google, tracked eight total Chrome zero-days being used by threat actors in the wild prior to patching, indicating an increasing volume of zero-day exploitation year-over-year. This dovetails with Mandiant findings in March that there were 50% more zero-day vulnerabilities exploited in the wild overall in 2023 than in 2022.\nThe majority of those exploitations were in pursuit of data theft and cyber-espionage efforts on the part of nation-state actors, the report found.\n\"The frequent discovery of zero-day vulnerabilities in Chrome has significant intelligence implications,\" Callie Guenther, senior manager of Cyber Threat Research at Critical Start, said in an emailed statement. \"These vulnerabilities can be exploited by threat actors, including state-sponsored groups, to conduct cyber espionage, steal sensitive information, and launch targeted attacks.\"\nTo prevent data breaches and more, users should ensure their systems are patched. Chrome will update automatically, unless a user doesn't close the browser or an extension prevents the update. To be on the safe side, users can manually start the update by clicking \"settings\" and then \"about Chrome.\"\nSecurity teams should ensure all Chrome installations are updated immediately. Additional steps would be to implement additional security measures, such as browser isolation and sandboxing.\n\"An emergency patch without details is basically Google\u2019s highest level of alert,\" Ellis said. \"It bears repeating that Chrome will save and reopen non-Incognito tabs, so if losing your place is stopping you or someone you know from applying this patch, you shouldn\u2019t delay.\"\nFor more information on dealing with data breaches and what they mean for your organizations, don't miss \"Anatomy of a Data Breach: What to Do if It Happens to You,\" a free Dark Reading virtual event scheduled for June 20.\nAbout the Author(s)\nTara Seals has 20+ years of experience as a journalist, analyst and editor in the cybersecurity, communications and technology space.

Was hinter dem neuen Design steckt und was genau anders aussieht.\nNutzer des Messengers WhatsApp haben sich in den vergangenen Wochen m\u00f6glicherweise dar\u00fcber gewundert, dass sich die App pl\u00f6tzlich mit anderen Farbt\u00f6nen und ver\u00e4nderten Icons pr\u00e4sentierte. Die Design-Updates wurden jetzt von WhatsApp offiziell best\u00e4tigt und erl\u00e4utert.\nIm Mittelpunkt steht eine neue gr\u00fcne Farbpalette, die einheitlich in den Apps f\u00fcr iOS und Android verwendet wird. Zudem wurden Icons, Illustrationen und Chathintergr\u00fcnde aktualisiert. Anders sehen auch die unten befindliche Leiste in Android und die oben stehende in iOS aus.

Gleichzeitig sei die Verwendung neutraler Farben erh\u00f6ht worden. Unter Android sei zudem der Dark Mode auf Wunsch vieler User verbessert worden.\nIn der Android-App wurde eine neue native Navigationsleiste hinzugef\u00fcgt, die den Wechsel zwischen den verschiedenen Funktionen beschleunigen soll. Bereits vor Kurzem wurden neue Chatfilter eingef\u00fchrt, die helfen sollen, Nachrichten nach Gruppen oder dem Ungelesen-Status zu sortieren.\n(mki)", "hash": "e5ed423a063bd187d06199d1323d370275548a44df3bea8658cb09ae2671b04f", "id": "b540fd63-7823-4c35-a57f-c83889e3b6a8", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Designaenderung-Warum-WhatsApp-ploetzlich-gruener-ist-9718094.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-14T16:30:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "8a5ba11a-509c-4376-9860-7b0371dfeac2", "title": "Design\u00e4nderung: Warum WhatsApp pl\u00f6tzlich gr\u00fcner ist"}], "tags": {"Idit Yaniv": {"name": "Idit Yaniv", "tag_type": "PER"}, "WhatsApp": {"name": "WhatsApp", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Design\u00e4nderung: Warum WhatsApp pl\u00f6tzlich gr\u00fcner ist"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T17:24:52.937691", "id": "ded2c09a-13a6-46fd-95d0-e0f01d8e3950", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "3"}], "created": "2024-05-14T16:30:00", "id": "9a25a09c-bba2-4040-a671-dd5441a24159", "news_items": [{"author": "Stefan Schomberg", "content": "Husqvarna ist Marktf\u00fchrer bei M\u00e4hrobotern. Da ist die Erwartung gro\u00df, wenn ein neues Ger\u00e4t auf den Markt kommt, und so eine Erwartung macht es oft fast unm\u00f6glich, sie in der Realit\u00e4t zu erf\u00fcllen. So erging es uns etwas, als wir den Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera mit Epos auf unseren Testrasen loslie\u00dfen. Denn schon bei der eigentlich einfachen Installation fielen uns Kleinigkeiten negativ auf, die die Konkurrenz besser macht und auch im Alltag konnte uns das neue Modell nicht immer zufriedenstellen. Das ist schade, denn in einigen Bereichen ist der M\u00e4hroboter mit und ohne Begrenzungsdraht richtig gut. Welche das sind, verraten wir im Test.\nWas sind die Highlights des Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera mit Epos?\nspannendes Design mit Lampen vorne\n-\nEdgecut-Feature mit zweiten M\u00e4hteller hinten\n-\nkann mit und ohne Begrenzungsdraht m\u00e4hen\n-\nM\u00e4hroboter vom Marktf\u00fchrer\n-\nDer Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera ist zum Testzeitpunkt ab 2139 Euro zu bekommen. Hinzu kommen 249 Euro f\u00fcr das Plug-in-Kit und 399 Euro f\u00fcr die Referenzstation RS1.\nWer lieber Alternativen h\u00e4tte, sollte einen Blick in unsere Top 10: Die besten M\u00e4hroboter ohne Begrenzungsdraht werfen. Alternativ d\u00fcrften diese Tests spannend sein:\nWie sieht der Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera mit Epos aus?\nHusqvarna entscheidet sich beim Automower 410XE Nera mit Epos f\u00fcr ein Design mit vorn liegenden Antriebsr\u00e4dern, hinten gibt es wie beim Segway Navimow i105E/i108E (Testbericht) nur zwei St\u00fctzr\u00e4der. Das l\u00e4sst den Automower zwar sehr agil erscheinen, allerdings schwenkt das Heck bei Kurven seitlich aus, sodass der M\u00e4her in Ecken schon fr\u00fchzeitig in sanfter Kurve Abstand zu seitlichen Hindernissen gewinnen muss. Dadurch bleiben Ecken weitestgehend unbeschnitten.\nDie zweite Besonderheit des Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera mit Epos ist, dass er grunds\u00e4tzlich gar nicht mit Epos, also dem Satellitennavigationssystem des Herstellers, zum Kunden kommt. Entsprechend fehlt dann der Epos-Zusatz im Namen. Stattdessen kaufen Kunden immer einen Schleifenm\u00e4her, bei dem wie bei herk\u00f6mmlichen M\u00e4hrobotern vor Gebrauch aufwendig ein Kabel im Garten verlegt werden muss. Nur, wer noch einmal rund 650 Euro f\u00fcr das in den Roboter einzubauende Epos-Kit und die \u201ekleine\u201c RTK-Antenne mit rund 500 Meter Reichweite ausgibt (es gibt auch eine mit mehreren Kilometern Reichweite f\u00fcr 999 Euro in der UVP), kann auf den Draht verzichten.\nBesonders ist auch die Anordnung der Schneidewerke unten am Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera mit Epos. So verf\u00fcgt das Modell recht mittig unter dem Chassis den Hauptm\u00e4hteller mit drei Klinken, weit hinten am Chassis installiert der Hersteller zudem einen kleineren M\u00e4hteller mit ebenfalls drei Klingen. Damit soll der 410XE randlos m\u00e4hen k\u00f6nnen.\nDie vierte \u201eBesonderheit\u201c ist die Beleuchtung vorn. Denn wie ein Auto etwa verf\u00fcgt der dunkelgraue Automower 410XE Nera mit oder ohne Epos \u00fcber zwei \u201eScheinwerfer\u201c vorn. Auch wenn die nicht \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig hell sind und der M\u00e4hroboter sie zum M\u00e4hen auch gar nicht ben\u00f6tigt, sieht das schon schick aus. Allerdings k\u00f6nnten sie Nutzer dazu verleiten, den Roboter auch nachts fahren zu lassen \u2013 davon raten wir zum Schutz von d\u00e4mmerungs- und nachtaktiven Tieren aber dringend ab!\nDas restliche Design mit seinen ausgestellten \u201eKotfl\u00fcgeln\u201c l\u00e4sst den Automower breit, tief und bullig wirken. Zur Bedienung am Ger\u00e4t selbst verf\u00fcgt der Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera oben neben der obligatorischen Notstopp-Taste ein kleines Farbdisplay mit angrenzendem Jogdial (Drehrad mit Druckfunktion) sowie eine Start-Taste. Alle Buttons inklusive des Drehrades f\u00fchlen sich dabei hochwertig und pr\u00e4zise an.\nAlle Bilder zum Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera mit EPOS im Test\nHusqvarna Automower 410XE Nera mit EPOS\nWie einfach ist die Inbetriebnahme beim Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera mit Epos?\nBei der ersten Installation sind wir \u00fcberraschend auf einige kleinere Fallstricke gesto\u00dfen, mit denen wir beim Marktf\u00fchrer nicht gerechnet haben. Einige sind darauf zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren, dass der Automower 410XE eben kein reiner RTK-M\u00e4her, sondern ein Hybridmodell ist, das mit zus\u00e4tzlichem Plug-in-Kit erst zu einem kabellosen M\u00e4hroboter aufgewertet werden will. Allerdings h\u00e4tte man das wohl im Detail auch besser l\u00f6sen k\u00f6nnen.\nSo fiel als Erstes auf, dass neben Kabel, Befestigungsmaterial und Epos-Kit sowie Antenne zwar (bis auf Schrauben) alles dabei ist, um die Montage zu beginnen. Allerdings wird im umfangreichen, in zahllosen Sprachen ausgef\u00fchrten Anleitungsbuch zwar davon gesprochen, dass die Antenne an einem Zaun oder einem Mast installiert werden kann, letzterer liegt aber nicht bei. Das macht die Konkurrenz anders, weshalb wir kurzerhand den nur rund 1 Meter langen Metallstab des Segway Navimow i105E & i108E (Testbericht) zweckentfremdeten.\nDabei kam die n\u00e4chste \u00dcberraschung: Husqvarna setzt zum Befestigen der RTK-Antenne an einer Stange auf einfache Schraubschellen, die zwar ihren Zweck absolut erf\u00fcllen, aber fummelig sind und etwas billig wirken. In Anbetracht des hohen Preises des Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera mit Epos finden wir das unangemessen.\nEine kleine Unachtsamkeit ist zudem im eigens dem Epos-Kit beiliegende Handbuch zu finden. Dort wird zwar Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt erkl\u00e4rt, wie man was verkabeln muss, um anschlie\u00dfend das Epos-System nutzen zu k\u00f6nnen. Wer allerdings einen Hinweis sucht, wo oder wie das Plug-in-Kit installiert wird, findet nur den Verweis auf die Anleitung, die er gerade liest \u2013 das ist m\u00e4\u00dfig hilfreich, um es nett auszudr\u00fccken. Letztlich ist das aber kein Hexenwerk: einfach die obere Abdeckung des Roboters entfernen, die nur aufgesteckt ist. Dann die beiden Sternschrauben l\u00f6sen, die mittig eine Abdeckplatte in Position halten, den Blindstopfen des aus dem Roboter bereitliegenden Kabels entfernen, das Kit daran anschlie\u00dfen und mit den gleichen Schrauben wieder befestigen. Die fr\u00fchere Abdeckplatte sollten Nutzer aufbewahren, sofern sie sp\u00e4ter vielleicht doch zum M\u00e4hen per Kabel zur\u00fcckkehren wollen.\nWie gut ist die App des Husqvarna Automower 410XE mit Epos?\nSind alle Ladestation und RTK-Antenne an den Strom angeschlossen, kann es endlich mit der Kontaktaufnahme zwischen Smartphone und M\u00e4hroboter losgehen. Ben\u00f6tigt wird daf\u00fcr die Automower-Connect-App, die es kostenlos im Android Playstore oder im Marketplace f\u00fcr iOS gibt. Anschlie\u00dfend will der M\u00e4her erst einmal mit dem vorgegebenen PIN-Code 1234 entsperrt werden, anschlie\u00dfend ein neuer ersonnen und danach RTK-Antenne und Ladestation mit dem Roboter gekoppelt werden. Wer den M\u00e4her von unterwegs aus steuern m\u00f6chte, muss sich zudem mit der Husqvarna-Cloud verbinden. Bei der Konkurrenz klappt das alles automatisch. Anschlie\u00dfend wollte unser Testger\u00e4t zwingend ein Firmware-Update over the Air einspielen, was mit einer Zeitspanne von bis zu 15 Minuten veranschlagt wurde. Bei uns dauerte das deutlich l\u00e4nger. Zu allem \u00dcberfluss gibt es keine Fortschrittsanzeige, sodass der Nutzer nicht erkennen kann, wie lange das wohl noch geht oder ob \u00fcberhaupt etwas passiert. Das geht besser.\nDer Rest der App ist nicht \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig, aber ausreichend \u00fcbersichtlich, zumindest meistens. Das liegt auch daran, dass es schlichtweg nicht gro\u00dfartig viel einzustellen gibt. Auf der Hauptseite erwartet den Nutzer ein Bild des M\u00e4hers mit einigen Grundangaben wie der T\u00e4tigkeit (etwa M\u00e4hen oder Pausieren). Au\u00dferdem gibt es hier Buttons f\u00fcr die R\u00fcckkehr zur Ladestation oder zum Starten. Am unteren Displayrand gibt es zudem weitere Reiter wie Karte, Shop, Erkunden und mehr. \u00dcber die Karte lernt der Nutzer den Roboter an und bringt ihm die Grenzen seiner zuk\u00fcnftigen Arbeitsst\u00e4tte bei. Das geschieht grunds\u00e4tzlich wie bei der Konkurrenz \u2013 mit dem gro\u00dfen Unterschied, dass der Besitzer jeden GPS-Punkt durch Dr\u00fccken der gro\u00dfen Plustaste unten rechts selbst festlegen muss. Bei allen anderen von uns bislang getesteten Modelle, bei denen der Nutzer die Grenzen h\u00e4ndisch anlernen muss, geschieht das automatisch.\nZum schwammigen Fahrverhalten w\u00e4hrend der manuellen Steuerung kommt dann also auch noch das sek\u00fcndliche Dr\u00fccken einer virtuellen Taste hinzu, was noch dazu jedes Mal von einem Klingelger\u00e4usch untermalt wird. Da ist die Konkurrenz schon deutlich weiter. Immerhin funktioniert diese Vorgehensweise \u2013 sowohl f\u00fcr M\u00e4hzonen, No-Go-Zonen und Pfade, die Zonen verbinden. In der Kartenansicht sieht man \u00fcbrigens auch die bereits gefahrenen M\u00e4hwege \u2013 oder zumindest die letzten. Mangels geordneter Bahnenfahrt l\u00e4sst sich das aber nicht zweifelsfrei sagen, offenbar wird nur eine bestimmte Anzahl dargestellt und dann wieder \u00fcberschrieben.\nIm Shop lassen sich nat\u00fcrlich Wartungs- und Ersatzteile sowie Zubeh\u00f6r erwerben, der Men\u00fcpunkt Erkunden verbirgt einige Tipps und Hinweise sowie etwas Werbung f\u00fcr Produkte des Herstellers. Unter Mehr gelangten Interessenten in die eigentlichen Einstellungen. Hier d\u00fcrfen sie Dinge wie einen Ecomodus einstellen, der etwa die GPS-Antenne deaktiviert, wenn der Roboter l\u00e4dt. Au\u00dferdem d\u00fcrfen hier Dinge wie die Objektvermeidung oder Edgecut aktiviert werden.\nIm Detail wirken viele Men\u00fcpunkte und Features etwas willk\u00fcrlich verteilt, sodass wichtige Funktionen untergehen. Die Funktion zum Einstellen der elektronischen H\u00f6henverstellung (eigentlich 20 bis 55 mm) f\u00fcr das Schneidwerk etwa haben wir anfangs komplett vergeblich gesucht. Nervig sind zudem die teils langen Wartezeiten, etwa wenn Einstellungen gespeichert werden. Das dauerte bei uns im Test gerne auch mal 20 bis 30 Sekunden und d\u00fcrfte an einem nicht perfekten WLAN gelegen haben. Im 4G-Betrieb gab es das deutlich weniger.\nWie gut m\u00e4ht der Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera mit Epos?\nIm Alltag schl\u00e4gt sich der 410X grunds\u00e4tzlich ordentlich. Zumindest, nachdem man den ersten Schock verdaut hat. Denn obwohl der Roboter nicht viel unter 3000 Euro kostet und dabei \u201enur\u201c f\u00fcr rund 1000 m\u00b2 ausgelegt ist, m\u00e4ht er nicht strukturiert in Bahnen, sondern wie die meisten Schleifenm\u00e4her nach dem Chaosprinzip. Das bedeutet: Er f\u00e4hrt in gerader Linie, bis er entweder auf ein Hindernis oder die Begrenzung st\u00f6\u00dft, macht dann in zuf\u00e4lligem Winkel kehrt und f\u00e4hrt genauso weiter.\nIm Alltag bedeutet das vor allem eines: Der Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera ist mit oder ohne Epos wesentlich langsamer als seine strukturierten Wettbewerber. Im Test ist das kaum genau nachzustellen, da aus der App nicht zuverl\u00e4ssig erkennbar ist, wo der Roboter bereits war. Allerdings sch\u00e4tzen wir, dass der Husqvarna-M\u00e4her gut f\u00fcnf bis zehnmal l\u00e4nger als etwa der Mammotion Luba 2 (Testbericht) f\u00fcr die gleiche Fl\u00e4che ben\u00f6tigt.\nDa der Bot selbst nicht genau wei\u00df, wo er bereits war, beendet er auch nicht den M\u00e4hvorgang mit dem Hinweis, dass er seine Aufgabe beendet hat. Stattdessen f\u00e4hrt er immer in vom Nutzer festgelegten Zeitintervallen und \u201ehofft\u201c, eines Tages tats\u00e4chlich jeden Winkel des Rasens abgefahren zu haben. Einen Vorteil hat das Chaos-Prinzip aber immerhin: Bahnen sieht man somit nicht auf dem Gr\u00fcn, daran sollen sich ja manche Interessenten st\u00f6ren.\nAnsonsten macht der M\u00e4her auf dem Gras einen ziemlich ordentlichen Eindruck. Er ist angenehm leise, am lautesten ist da fast schon das Abs\u00e4beln der Grasspitzen. Au\u00dferdem hat der Automower 410XE einen nicht zu verachtenden Vorteil: Er m\u00e4ht nah an den Rand. Das schafft er dank seines zweiten M\u00e4htellers am Heck. Im Betrieb f\u00e4hrt er nah an die zuvor abgesteckte Grenze, setzt dann leicht zur\u00fcck und dreht sich. Dabei schwenkt das Heck aus und der Bot m\u00e4ht mit dem hinteren kleinen Schneidwerk den Rand. Das klappt auch nah an h\u00f6heren Hindernissen wie Mauern oder Z\u00e4unen. Bei gen\u00fcgend Zeit klappt das mit dem Husqvarna-Modell vielleicht sogar am besten aller bislang getesteten Modelle. Bei gleich hohen Hindernissen wie Terrassen- oder Randsteinen kann der Automower hingegen wie andere GPS-M\u00e4her einfach leicht auf die Steine fahren, um m\u00f6glichst viel Rand zu m\u00e4hen.\nEbenfalls relativ gut gefallen hat und die Hinderniserkennung auf Radarbasis. Damit erkennt er kleinere und gr\u00f6\u00dfere Objekte auf dem Gr\u00fcn und umf\u00e4hrt sie normalerweise. Wir haben das mit unserer Igel-Attrappe probiert. Sofern der Roboter direkt mittig darauf zuf\u00e4hrt, hat er die kleine Statue immer als Hindernis erkannt und abgedreht. Lag sie hingegen eher im Randbereich, wurde sie vom Automower auch an- und fast \u00fcberfahren. Hier zeigt sich einmal mehr, dass M\u00e4hroboter nicht in der D\u00e4mmerung oder gar bei Nacht fahren sollten!\nDie Signalst\u00e4rke des Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera ist ebenfalls tadellos und liegt in etwa auf dem Niveau des Stiga A1500 (Testbericht). Damit geh\u00f6rt er zu den stabilsten RTK-M\u00e4hern, so schnell verliert das Modell seine GPS-Positionierung nicht. Allerdings kommt auch dieses System an seine Grenzen. Wer etwa besonders enge, von B\u00fcschen, B\u00e4umen oder Hausw\u00e4nden abgeschirmte Bereiche m\u00e4hen will, muss etwas mehr Ungenauigkeit in Kauf nehmen. Kombisysteme mit GPS und Kamera wie beim Mammotion Luba 2 (Testbericht) sind hier derzeit das Ma\u00df der Dinge.\nGegen Diebstahl helfen beim Marktf\u00fchrer PIN, diverse Sensoren und ein Geofence-Bereich, bei dessen Verlassen der M\u00e4her Alarm schl\u00e4gt. Au\u00dferdem ist er dann per App ortbar. Ein Kletterk\u00fcnstler ist der 410XE hingegen nicht, der Hersteller spricht von maximal 30 Prozent Steigf\u00e4higkeit \u2013 ausreichend. Zu Integration ins eigene Smart Home stehen die Dienste Amazon Alexa, Google Home und IFTTT zur Verf\u00fcgung. Der Akku des Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera mit Epos reicht aus, um etwa 1,5 Stunden am St\u00fcck zu m\u00e4hen. Anschlie\u00dfend l\u00e4dt er f\u00fcr etwa die gleiche Zeit und setzt dann seine Arbeit fort, sofern der Nutzer nichts anderes eingestellt hat.\nPreis\nDie UVP des Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera als Schleifenm\u00e4her liegt bei stolzen 2699 Euro. Wer kabellos m\u00e4hen m\u00f6chte, muss noch Plug-in-Kit und RTK-Antenne dazukaufen. Der Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera ist zum Testzeitpunkt ab 2139 Euro zu bekommen. Hinzu kommen 249 Euro f\u00fcr das Plug-in-Kit und 399 Euro f\u00fcr die Referenzstation RS1.\nBessere Alternativen sind in unseren Augen der deutlich g\u00fcnstigere Segway Navimow i108E (Testbericht) oder der \u00e4ltere, aber immer noch gute Segway Navimow der H-Serie (Testbericht), etwa in der Ausf\u00fchrung als H1500. Beide Modelle bieten mehr Features und eine bessere App. Noch besser hat uns der Luba 2 von Mammotion (Testbericht) gefallen, der zum fast gleichen Preis wie der 410XE die dreifache Fl\u00e4che m\u00e4hen kann und dank GPS und Kamera noch stabiler navigiert. Die beste Hardware hatte in unseren Tests bislang der Stiga A1500 (Testbericht). Wer es hingegen noch einfacher haben will, darf einen Blick auf den Worx Vision (Testbericht) werfen. Er kann zwar noch etwas weniger, ist aber auch g\u00fcnstiger als das Modell vom Marktf\u00fchrer.\nFazit\nSagen wir, wie es ist: Der Husqvarna Automower 410XE Nera mit Epos entt\u00e4uscht uns. Nicht unbedingt, weil er ein schlechter M\u00e4hroboter ohne Begrenzungskabel w\u00e4re, sondern weil er zu einem h\u00f6heren Preis als bei der Konkurrenz meist weniger bietet \u2013 und das vom Marktf\u00fchrer! Positiv hervorzuheben ist das ordentliche und halbwegs leichte Chassis (12,5 kg), mit dem sich der Roboter nie festfuhr und selten durchdrehende R\u00e4der zeigte. Zudem ist der M\u00e4her angenehm leise.

Having some form of 2-factor authentication in place is a great start, but many organizations may not yet be in that spot or have the needed level of authentication sophistication to adequately safeguard organizational data. When deploying advanced authentication measures, organizations can make mistakes, and it is crucial to be aware of these potential pitfalls.\n1. Failing to conduct a risk assessment\nA comprehensive risk assessment is a vital first step to any authentication implementation. An organization leaves itself open to risk if it fails to assess current threats and vulnerabilities, systems and processes or needed level of protections required for different applications and data.\nNot all applications demand the same levels of security. For example, an application that handles sensitive customer information or financials may require stronger authentication measures compared to less critical systems. Without a risk assessment, organizations won't be able to effectively categorize and prioritize what needs additional authentication.\nHence, the a need for elevating organizational security with advanced authentication.\nOn top of that, not all users need access to all applications or data. For example, a user in marketing doesn't need access to sensitive HR data. By evaluating roles as part of a risk assessment, organizations can look to implement role-based access controls (RBAC) which ensure that users in a particular role only have access to the data and applications needed to complete their work.\n2. Not completing due diligence to integrate authentication with current systems\nConsidering compatibility with existing systems, especially legacy ones, is essential to ensure a cohesive authentication framework across an entire infrastructure. Adhering to industry-standard authentication methods is crucial. This may involve recoding application frontends to adopt OIDC (OpenID Connect) or SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) flows. Many vendors offer toolkits that simplify this process to help ensure seamless integration.\nDoing due diligence to make sure your systems have integration options with an authentication system helps to reduce implementation complexity and enhances overall security.\n3. Requiring only one authentication factor\nRequiring at least two authentication factors is imperative in today's security landscape. A selection of recommended additional factors include:\nPhysical tokens: Devices like Yubikey or Google Titan tokens generate digital signatures that offer another layer of identity security\n-\nBiometric authentication: Factors like fingerprints or facial recognition\n-\nTrusted devices: Device enrollment or the presence of an issued and verified certificate ensures that the users we know are using trusted devices and can access the systems they need\n-\nHigh Trust factors such as BankID or Government e-ID\n-\nConsider data sensitivity when choosing authentication factors. For highly sensitive information, a combination of multiple factors can offer higher levels of security. However, access to less sensitive data may be granted with just a password and a time-based-one-time-password (TOTP) authenticator app code or PUSH notification.\nAnother option to explore would be passwordless authentication. Instead of a password, this option leverages other authentication factors like biometrics, trusted devices or physical tokens to grant access.\nReyling on one authentication factor is not enough to effectively combat the evolving threats facing organizations.\n4. Forgetting about user experience\nIf a user's authentication flow is too unwieldy and cumbersome, users will become frustrated. Balancing security and accessibility is crucial for a positive user experience. When considering advanced authentication factors, prioritize solutions that minimize steps and reduce friction. Clear instructions, user-friendly interfaces and self-service options enhance the user experience.\n5. Not paying attention to authentication activities and patterns\nWithout regular review or insights into user behaviors, organizations won't be able to effectively assess or mitigate risks. Regular monitoring and analysis of authentication activities are essential to ensure ongoing security.\nWhile most Identity and Access Management (IAM) platforms offer logging data and dashboards, real-time alerts to suspicious or abnormal behavior through SIEM integrations allow organizations to quickly identify threats and take action. These alerts notify admins and security teams of unauthorized access attempts via unusual login patterns.\nSome organizations implement risk-based authentication, which leverages machine learning to develop a profile of past login behavior and adjusts security measures to verify user identity in real-time. Login attempts with elevated risk scores are required to provide additional authentication factors or are denied access entirely, while lower risk logins are prompted with fewer requirements or bypass authentication altogether.\n6. Neglecting to train and educate users\nTraining users is essential for enhancing overall security. Otherwise, users may engage in risky behaviors that put the organization in a more vulnerable position.\nEffective end-user training involves providing clear, user-friendly documentation on setting up and using advanced authentication methods. This documentation should offer step-by-step instructions, screenshots and troubleshooting tips for easy understanding and enrollment. Additionally, highlighting real-world examples and case studies of security breaches can bring heightened awareness to potential consequences.\nPromoting a culture of security awareness and vigilance allows organizations to instill a sense of responsibility among users and encourages proactive participation in authentication.\nBy avoiding these mistakes, organizations can significantly enhance their security posture, reduce the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches and further protect valuable company assets.", "hash": "62936909a352310a50977e9d2c9a2eca861004d2c001c8c13010fcb9f546b087", "id": "a9eda16a-1762-409f-84bf-ffc923896f31", "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/6-mistakes-organizations-make-when.html", "osint_source_id": "ef5f3f17-365f-4dfb-889d-5a3ef3bdfff0", "published": "2024-05-14T16:21:00", "source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheHackersNews", "story_id": "fe45ba38-4509-493d-a98e-68021d097156", "title": "6 Mistakes Organizations Make When Deploying Advanced Authentication"}], "tags": {"BankID": {"name": "BankID", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "IAM": {"name": "IAM", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "OpenID Connect": {"name": "OpenID Connect", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "RBAC": {"name": "RBAC", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "SAML": {"name": "SAML", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "SIEM": {"name": "SIEM", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "Yubikey": {"name": "Yubikey", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "6 Mistakes Organizations Make When Deploying Advanced Authentication"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-15T01:08:28.718743", "id": "0e0292bf-88b3-4d1a-89cd-0bfb56dd3f4e", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-15T01:11:35.317923", "id": "6f222273-017e-48d5-b07e-06f02fffe2c7", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "13"}], "created": "2024-05-14T16:15:14", "id": "995c7686-4df3-4914-bf1a-60fbda945ad3", "news_items": [{"author": "Sergiu Gatlan", "content": "Microsoft fixes VPN failures caused by April Windows updates\nMay 14, 2024\n-\n04:15 PM\n-\n0\n-\nToday, Microsoft fixed a known issue breaking VPN connections across client and server platforms after installing the April 2024 Windows security updates.\n\"Windows devices might face VPN connection failures after installing the April 2024 security update or the April 2024 non-security preview update,\" Redmond explains on the Windows health dashboard.\nThe list of impacted Windows versions includes Windows 11, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2008 and later.\nWhile Microsoft did not provide a root cause for these VPN failures, it advised home users to use the Windows Get Help app and small business and large enterprise customers to reach out via the dedicated \"Support for Business\" portal if they need support.\nTwo weeks after first acknowledging it, Microsoft fixed this known issue in Windows cumulative updates released during the May 2024 Patch Tuesday.\nThe complete list of affected Windows versions and the cumulative updates that fix the VPN failures includes:\nClient: Windows 11 22H2/23H2 (KB5037771), Windows 11 21H2 (KB5037770), and Windows 10 (KB5037768).\n-\nServer: Windows Server 2022 (KB5037782), Windows Server 2019 (KB5037765), Windows Server 2016 (KB5037763), Windows Server 2012 R2 (KB5037823), Windows Server 2012 (KB5037778), Windows Server 2008 R2 (KB5037780), Windows Server 2008 SP2 (KB5037800).\n-\nAdmins who cannot immediately install this month's Patch Tuesday updates can temporarily address the VPN issues by removing the problematic April cumulative updates.\n\"To remove the LCU after installing the combined SSU and LCU package, use the DISM/Remove-Package command line option with the LCU package name as the argument.

Their guidance book, released today, provides detailed advice on how organizations can avoid paying ransoms, addressing recommendations from parliament [PDF].\nInsurers can't use 'act of war' excuse to avoid Merck's $1.4B NotPetya payout\nREAD MOREFor people who live and breathe cybersecurity, the information in the guidebook isn't novel. However, the NCSC and insurers see it as a useful reference for organizations that lack the necessary infosec understanding to manage a highly stressful situation effectively.\nIt does not provide a step-by-step guide on remediating ransomware attacks \u2013 that's a job for incident responders \u2013 but rather offers a collection of approaches to consider before making a payment.\nThe advice includes recommendations to consult experts where possible, involve the right people across the organization, investigate the root cause, and, of course, \"Don't panic.\"\nAs was evidenced by the LockBit leaks earlier this year, something that was long suspected to be true but never proven until then, ransomware gangs don't always deliver on their promise to delete a victim's data after they pay. It's another consideration that may be useful to organizations in a frenzied state trying to resolve the matter as quickly and quietly as possible.\n\"The NCSC does not encourage, endorse, or condone paying ransoms, and it's a dangerous misconception that doing so will make an incident go away or free victims of any future headaches,\" said Oswald. \"In fact, every ransom that is paid signals to criminals that these attacks bear fruit and are worth doing.\n\"This cross-sector initiative is an excellent next step in foiling the ransom business model: We're proud to support work that will see cybercriminals' wallets emptier and UK organizations more resilient.\"\nIt's not lost on the NCSC that this won't be as effective as an outright legal ban on ransom payments, which has long been discussed among industry and international governments.\nNHS Digital hints at exploit sightings of Arcserve UDP vulnerabilities\n-\n'Cyberattack' shutters Christie's website days before $840M art mega-auction\n-\nUncle Sam urges action after Black Basta ransomware infects Ascension\n-\nEncrypted mail service Proton hands suspect's personal info to cops again\n-\nThose discussions are happening at the highest levels of government, and the matter is a Home Office priority, it's understood, but implementing a ban, in whatever form it may take, will require a substantial amount of time.\nDuring that time, there will be many ransomware attacks, so this guidebook is seen as a stop-gap measure while the government works on a more permanent solution to the ransom payment problem.\nDespite widespread dissemination of advice on handling ransomware, experts believe there is still a significant problem with organizations believing they will never be the target of an attack. Too many are blind to their risk and adopt the \"it will never happen to me\" mindset.\nThe prevailing view at the NCSC and among insurers is that any measures undermining the ransomware business model are a step forward, regardless of their permanence.\nIn Oswald's opening speech at CYBERUK today, she likened the act of a trusted organization paying a ransom to a cybercriminal gang to \"leaving a carrier bag full of used bank notes in a dark alley.\"\n\"That's why today's agreement with the insurance sector is so important,\" she added.\nUnhappy about excluding nation-state attacks from cyberinsurance? Get ready to pay\nREAD MOREInsurance associations such as the ABI already have interactive online tools offering advice similar to the coalition's guidebook. Its online Cyber Safety tool walks organizations through their security posture to get a tailored action plan for building better cyber resilience.\nThe ABI's director of general insurance policy, Mervyn Skeet, said: \"We're pleased to be working with NCSC, BIBA, and the IUA on strengthening cyber resilience and supporting customers affected by ransomware attacks.\n\"Following the launch of our Cyber Safety Tool for SMEs last year, this collaborative guidance is another positive step towards tackling cybercrime across the UK, and we look forward to continuing to work with NCSC on this shared goal.\"\nSarah Pearce, Partner at Hunton Andrews Kurth said: \"Without a doubt, ransomware attacks have been on the rise in recent months and this initiative is welcome news.\n\"Helping guide clients through the handling in the event of such an attack including the strategic considerations that go into assessing whether or not to pay ransom demands is always an intense period and the C-suite/senior management are under extreme pressure to make critical decisions in a time-pressured environment.\"\nPearce added that the strategic considerations vary, but giving into ransom demands only incentivizes \"cybercriminals to expand their activities.\" \u00ae", "hash": "401424c20bbaeca5dd987da87373681848f0a808e76cb80d73d27d2315c8228b", "id": "738e00d4-7e74-4baf-8b12-e46bccbcb593",

"news_items": [{"author": "info@thehackernews.com (The Hacker News)", "content": "Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered an ongoing social engineering campaign that bombards enterprises with spam emails with the goal of obtaining initial access to their environments for follow-on exploitation.\n\"The incident involves a threat actor overwhelming a user's email with junk and calling the user, offering assistance,\" Rapid7 researchers Tyler McGraw, Thomas Elkins, and Evan McCann said.\n\"The threat actor prompts impacted users to download remote monitoring and management software like AnyDesk or utilize Microsoft's built-in Quick Assist feature in order to establish a remote connection.\"\nThe novel campaign is said to be underway since late April 2024, with the emails primarily consisting of newsletter sign-up confirmation messages from legitimate organizations and done so with an aim to overwhelm email protection solutions.\nThe impacted users are then approached over phone calls by masquerading as the company's IT team, tricking them into installing a remote desktop software under the guise of resolving the email issues.\nThe remote access to their computer is subsequently leveraged to download additional payloads to harvest credentials and maintain persistence on the hosts.\nThis is accomplished by executing various batch scripts, one of which also establishes contact with a command-and-control (C2) server to download a legitimate copy of OpenSSH for Windows and ultimately launch a reverse shell to the server.\nIn one incident observed by the cybersecurity firm, the threat actors behind the campaign unsuccessfully attempted to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons to other assets within the compromised network.\nWhile there is no evidence of ransomware being executed as part of the campaign, Rapid7 said the activity overlaps with previously identified attack indicators associated with the Black Basta ransomware operators.\nThe attack chain has also been used to deliver additional remote monitoring and management tools like ConnectWise ScreenConnect as well as a remote access trojan called NetSupport RAT, which has been recently put to use by FIN7 actors as part of a malvertising campaign.\nThis is particularly noteworthy in light of the fact that FIN7 actors are suspected to have close ties with Black Basta. While FIN7 initially used point-of-sale (PoS) malware to conduct financial fraud, it has since pivoted to ransomware operations, either in the capacity of an affiliate or conducting its own operations under the names DarkSide and BlackMatter.\n\"After successfully gaining access to the compromised asset, Rapid7 observed the threat actor attempting to deploy Cobalt Strike beacons, disguised as a legitimate Dynamic Link Library (DLL) named 7z.DLL, to other assets within the same network as the compromised asset using the Impacket toolset,\" Rapid7 said.\nPhorpiex Distributes LockBit Black\nThe development comes as Proofpoint revealed details of a new LockBit Black (aka LockBit 3.0) ransomware campaign that leverages the Phorpiex (aka Trik) botnet as a conduit to deliver email messages containing the ransomware payload.\nMillions of messages are estimated to have been sent out during the high-volume campaign that began on April 24, 2024. It's currently not clear who is behind the attack.\n\"The LockBit Black sample from this campaign was likely built from the LockBit builder that was leaked during the summer of 2023,\" Proofpoint researchers said.\n\"The LockBit Black builder has provided threat actors with access to proprietary and sophisticated ransomware. The combination of this with the longstanding Phorpiex botnet amplifies the scale of such threat campaigns and increases chances of successful ransomware attacks.\"\nInsights into the Mallox Ransomware Group\nRansomware attacks have also been observed brute-forcing Microsoft SQL servers to deploy the Mallox file-encrypting malware via a .NET-based loader named PureCrypter, according to Sekoia.\nA closed ransomware group operating from the European region, Mallox is known to be distributed since at least June 2021. It gained prominence in mid-2022 following its transition to a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and a double extortion strategy.\nTwo different online personas associated with the group, namely Mallx and RansomR, have been observed actively recruiting affiliates for the operation on several underground forums.\nFurther analysis of the threat actor's data exfiltration server and their dark web infrastructure has revealed the names of different \"staff\" members, including Admin, Support, Maestro, Team, Neuroframe, Panda, Grindr, Hiervos, and Vampire.\n\"Mallox is almost certainly an opportunistic intrusion set impacting organizations in various verticals, notably the manufacturing, the retail and the technology ones,\" the company said.\n\"Although Mallox representatives actively seek high-revenue targets (as indicated in recruitment posts on cybercrime forums), most of the ransomware's victims known in open-source are small and middle size enterprises.\"", "hash":

estimating that 895,204 people are impacted by a ransomware attack it suffered in August 2023.\nSinging River Health System is a major healthcare provider located in Mississippi, operating the Singing River Hospital in Pascagoula, Ocean Springs Hospital, and the Singing River Gulfport Hospital, collectively providing over 700 beds.\nThe health system, which employs over 3,500 people, also operates two hospices, four pharmacies, six imaging centers, ten specialty centers, and twelve medical clinics in the Gulf Coast region.\nOn August 19, 2023, Singing River announced that it had been targeted by a sophisticated ransomware attack, which resulted in operational disruptions at its hospitals and potentially data theft.\nSinging River was added to the HHS' Office for Civil Rights breach portal in late August, with a temporary figure of 501 impacted individuals.\nOn September 13, 2023, the healthcare organization confirmed that data had been exfiltrated from its systems, and on December 18, 2023, it announced that the incident impacted 252,890 people.\nThe latest and presumably final update on the estimate of exposed individuals came yesterday, with Singing River now saying to Maine's authorities that 895,204 people were impacted.\nAccording to the latest information in the data breach notice and also the latest update on the organization's site, the exposed data includes:\nFull name\n-\nDate of birth\n-\nPhysical address\n-\nSocial Security Number (SSN)\n-\nMedical information\n-\nHealth information\n-\nSinging River said there is no evidence that any of the exposed data was used for identity theft or fraud, and it offers 24 months of credit monitoring and identity restoration services through IDX to all letter recipients.\nThe attack was claimed by the Rhysida ransomware gang, which is notorious for attacking healthcare service providers, most recently, even children's hospitals.\nThe threat actors have so far leaked roughly 80% of the data they claim to hold from the breach at Singing River, which allegedly includes a catalog of 420,766 files totaling 754 GB in size.\nConsidering this exposure, impacted people are recommended to enroll in IDX's services as soon as possible, treat unsolicited communications with caution, monitor all accounts for suspicious activity, and consider placing a security freeze on their credit report.\nPost a Comment Community

Diesmal ist es offiziell nur ein Tag, an dem sich die Entwickler*innen virtuell zu verschiedensten Vortr\u00e4gen rund um Googles \u00d6kosysteme treffen. Er\u00f6ffnet wird die Google I/O traditionell mit der Keynote.\nHier findet ihr den Livestream, darunter unseren Liveticker.\nGoogle I/O 2024 Keynote\nSundar Pichai ist da\nUnd er startet mit einem Taylor-Swift-Joke. Die I/O sei so etwas wie die \"Eras Tour\", \"aber mit weniger Kost\u00fcmwechseln\", so der Google-Chef.\n-\nLos geht's\n...und wir starten wenig \u00fcberraschend mit Gemini und einem Video, das verschiedene Anwendungen von K\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz pr\u00e4sentiert.\n-\nIm Livestream wird \u00fcbrigens schon hippe Elektromusik von einem wilden Mann im bunten Bademantel aufgelegt\n-\nSmart Home\nD\u00fcrfte ich mir etwas w\u00fcnschen, w\u00e4ren das Smart-Home-Ger\u00e4te mit Gemini. Etwa neue Nest-Speaker oder vielleicht sogar ein neues smartes DIsplay. Allzu viele Hoffnungen mache ich mir hier aber nicht...\n-\nWenig durchgesickert\nInteressant an der heurigen Google-Keynote ist, dass erstaunlich wenig vorab durchgesickert ist. Auch im Hinblick auf Hardware-Ank\u00fcndigungen ist noch v\u00f6llig unklar, ob oder was kommt. Das g\u00fcnstige Pixel 8a hat Google ja schon vergangene Woche vorweggenommen.\n-\nWie macht die KI, was ich will?\nW\u00e4hrend ihr wartet: Der Umgang mit Gemini, ChatGPT und Microsoft Copilot muss gelernt sein. Um die KI-Chatbots wirklich nutzen zu k\u00f6nnen, muss man a) wissen was sie schon k\u00f6nnen und b) auch richtig danach fragen. Wir haben hier ein paar Tipps f\u00fcr euch zusammengestellt, wie man gute Prompts formuliert:\n-\nKI-Suche\nBei Google und Microsoft ist immer wieder die Suchmaschine ein Thema. KI soll alles besser machen, bisher ist davon aber noch nichts zu sehen. Auch hier gr\u00e4tscht OpenAI rein. Erst hie\u00df es, bald w\u00fcrde eine eigene Suche angek\u00fcndigt, dann kam die Entwarnung: Der Google-Killer kommt doch noch nicht. Gearbeitet wird daran vermutlich trotzdem.\nW\u00fcrde es Google heute gelingen, ein \u00fcberzeugendes Produkt vorzustellen, k\u00f6nnte der Konkurrenz der Wind aus den Segeln genommen werden. Denn Google gilt es zu schlagen, und das funktioniert nicht mit Funktionen, die die weltweit beliebteste Suchmaschine schon hat.\n-\nOpenAI prescht wieder vor\nGestern, und damit einen Tag vor der I/O (ein Schelm, wer B\u00f6ses denkt), hat Konkurrent OpenAI sein verbessertes Sprachmodell GPT-4o vorgestellt. Auch Nutzer*innen der Gratisversion k\u00f6nnen jetzt auf den Bildgenerator und Echtzeit-Internetdaten zugreifen. Zudem erkennt die KI Stimmungen, wenn man die Spracherkennung nutzt und sie kann Bilder und Videoinhalte analysieren. Google wird etwas \u00e4hnliches pr\u00e4sentieren. Der Kampf um die Vorherrschaft ist also weiter in vollem Gange.\n-\nSuche nach dem Killer-Feature\nDer Hype um KI h\u00e4lt sich nun schon eine ganze Weile, so richtig eingeschlagen ist das aber noch nicht. Das liegt vor allem daran, dass viele im Alltag gar nicht wissen, was sie damit anfangen sollen. Das eine Feature, das alles ver\u00e4ndern wird, hat noch niemand vorgestellt. Ob Google das heute \u00e4ndern wird, darf bezweifelt werden - aber wir lassen uns auch gern \u00fcberraschend.\n-\nDie gro\u00dfe Frage wird f\u00fcr uns hier in \u00d6sterreich sein: Wie viele der neuen Features schaffen es auch in die EU? Aufgrund der strengen Datenschutzgesetze k\u00f6nnte es zumindest l\u00e4nger dauern, bis es bestimmte Funktionen nach Europa schaffen.\n-\nK\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz\nEs d\u00fcrfte wohl niemanden \u00fcberraschen, dass Googles I/O heuer ganz im Zeichen der KI stehen wird. Ein interessantes Feature, bei dem Gemini Videoinhalte live analysieren, bewerten und Fragen dazu beantworten kann, hat der Konzern bereits gestern geteilt. Das d\u00fcrfte ein kleiner Ausblick darauf sein, wie KI k\u00fcnftig Android verbessern soll.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Google teasert neue KI-Suche f\u00fcr Handy-Kameras an\n-\nWillkommen\nWillkommen bei unserem Liveticker zur Keynote der heurigen Google I/O, um 19:00 geht's los!\n-\nKommentare", "hash": "299036cad8081c93e1a06492a711653454d75924923750c2f81584b5b22e6fc9", "id": "0889adb1-15ab-4cd3-982c-a8612bdd1863", "link": "https://futurezone.at/produkte/google-io-livestream-liveticker-konferenz-gemini-kuenstliche-intelligenz/402896228", "osint_source_id": "eec2ad26-2f4c-4dd8-a3e5-08c0eb3765ca", "published": "2024-05-14T16:02:08", "source": "https://futurezone.at/xml/rss", "story_id": "3125daf4-c478-43ee-bcb6-6d7d6e096d0f", "title": "Livestream und Liveticker: Google k\u00fcndigt Neuerungen auf der I/O an"}], "tags": {"Eras Tour": {"name": "Eras Tour", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Europa": {"name": "Europa", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "GPT-4o": {"name": "GPT-4o", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Gemini Videoinhalte": {"name": "Gemini Videoinhalte", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Google": {"name": "Google", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "KI-Suche": {"name": "KI-Suche", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Sundar Pichai": {"name": "Sundar Pichai", "tag_type": "PER"}, "\u00d6sterreich": {"name": "\u00d6sterreich", "tag_type": "Country"}}, "title": "Livestream und Liveticker: Google k\u00fcndigt Neuerungen auf der I/O an"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T17:27:54.736413", "id": "d4c7a738-fce7-4aa1-a9ac-a1c8eb99f4ce", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "11"}], "created": "2024-05-14T16:00:00", "id": "2278a648-7cd2-4591-ae29-6ef1890f3305", "news_items": [{"author": "Matthias Parbel", "content": "data2day 2024: Von Data Mesh bis GenAI \u2013 eine neue \u00c4ra in Data Science\nWie ver\u00e4ndern LLMs, GenAI und Knowledge Graphs die Data Science und welche Datenarchitektur bew\u00e4hrt sich in der Praxis?

Erfahrungsberichte geben Einblicke in die Praxis und die bei der praktischen Umsetzung von Data-Science- und Machine-Learning-Projekten gewonnenen Erkenntnisse.\nData Mesh & Co.: Der Weg zur geeigneten Datenarchitektur\nMit einem dezentralen Datenarchitekturansatz will Data Mesh unter anderem Entwicklerinnen und Entwickler in die Lage versetzen, selbstst\u00e4ndig dom\u00e4nen\u00fcbergreifende Datenanalysen durchzuf\u00fchren. Doch wie bew\u00e4hrt sich dieser Ansatz in der Praxis und welche Herausforderungen m\u00fcssen Unternehmen meistern, um eine auf die eigenen Bed\u00fcrfnisse zugeschnittene Datenarchitektur umzusetzen? Antworten auf diese und weitere Fragen gehen zahlreiche Vortr\u00e4ge auf der data2day 2024 nach. Aus jahrelanger Projekterfahrung wei\u00df Matthias Niehoff, Head of Data & AI bei codecentric, dass es nicht die eine richtige Datenarchitektur gibt, sondern Unternehmen auf der Grundlage individueller Rahmenbedingungen das f\u00fcr sie passende Design finden m\u00fcssen. In seinem Talk stellt er unterschiedliche L\u00f6sungsans\u00e4tze vor und gibt einen \u00dcberblick zu den notwendigen Entscheidungen bei der Wahl einer Datenarchitektur.\nFilip Stepniak und Nicolas Haubner von esentri unterziehen derweil den Data-Mesh-Ansatz einem Reality-Check und pr\u00e4sentieren die gesammelten Erfahrungen aus der Einf\u00fchrung eines Data Mesh bei einem global aufgestellten Maschinenbau-Konzern.\nLLMs, GenAI und Knowledge Graphs: Eine neue \u00c4ra in der Data Science?\nVon der Datenakquise zum Prompt Engineering \u2013 gro\u00dfe Sprachmodelle (Large Language Models \u2013 LLMs), Generative AI und Knowledge Graphs (KGs) er\u00f6ffnen neue Herangehensweisen f\u00fcr die Arbeit von Entwicklerinnen und Entwicklern, aber ebenso f\u00fcr Data Scientists. Mit Chat-Bots und ma\u00dfgeschneiderten Prompts lassen sich Daten aus den unterschiedlichsten Quellsystemen einfacher abfragen.

Establishing this security baseline at the tenant level puts in place additional security to protect your cloud investments and company. \nMFA is a security method commonly required among cloud service providers and requires users to provide two or more pieces of evidence to verify their identity before accessing a service or a resource. It adds an extra layer of protection to the standard username and password authentication.\n \nThe roll-out of this requirement will be gradual and methodical to minimize impact on your use cases. The blog post below provides helpful information from the Azure product team to assist you in getting ready to MFA-enable your access to Azure services.  Going forward, the team will provide communications to you about your specific roll-out dates through direct emails and Azure Portal notifications. Expect these in the coming months.  \n \nRead on to learn why and how MFA is important to securing customers on Azure and your workloads, environments, and users.\n \nIf you do not wait to wait for the roll-out, set up MFA now with the MFA wizard for Microsoft Entra.\n \n- Erin\n \nHow MFA works\nMulti-factor authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires users to provide two or more pieces of evidence to verify their identity before accessing a service or a resource. The evidence can be something the user knows (such as a password or a PIN), something the user has (such as a phone or a token), or something the user is (such as a fingerprint or a face scan).\n \nMFA adds an extra layer of protection to the standard username and password authentication, making it harder for attackers to compromise accounts and steal data. MFA can also help prevent unauthorized access due to phishing, credential stuffing, brute force, or password reuse attacks.\n \nEntra ID supports various MFA methods, such as Microsoft Authenticator app, SMS, voice call, and hardware tokens. Users can choose the method that suits their preferences and needs.  Admins can also use Entra ID Conditional Access policies to tune when MFA is required based on signals such as the user\u2019s location, device, role, or risk level.\n \nWhy MFA is important for Azure tenant security\nThe need for MFA is more important than ever, as cyberattacks are becoming more frequent, sophisticated, and damaging. According to a report by Microsoft, 99.9% of compromised accounts did not use MFA. The report also found that MFA can block more than 99.2% of account compromise attacks, making it one of the most effective security measures available. As noted in the report, MFA can block more than 99.9% of account compromise attacks, making it one of the most effective security measures available.\n \nThe rise of the hybrid workforce and accelerated digital transformation of businesses by the COVID-19 pandemic expanded risk scenarios for employees and companies. Today, more people work outside of the office and access data and applications from various devices and locations. All of this has increased the attack surface and the potential for unauthorized access, as users may use unsecured networks, devices, or passwords. MFA can help mitigate these risks by adding an extra verification step and preventing access from unknown or suspicious sources.\n \nMFA is also a key component of identity and access management, which involves ensuring that only authorized and authenticated users can access the services and resources. One of the three areas of engineering advancements within Microsoft\u2019s Secure Future Initiative focuses on implementing new identity protections and MFA at the tenant level helps you with identity protections. MFA not only reduces the risk of account compromise and data breach, but it also helps you comply with various security standards and regulations, such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, and NIST.\n \nDon\u2019t wait to set up MFA\nTo help you keep users and data safe, MFA is now available and free for you to enable at the tenant level. You can set up MFA today with the MFA wizard for Microsoft Entra.\n \nIf you have additional questions, please review the MFA FAQ on Microsoft Learn for more information and learn more about the Secure Future Initiative and Microsoft\u2019s built-in security features here.", "hash": "bac9e719f38b7d7f29f42cfcc7f5820003d058a76241aa07301aa369267fd3f3", "id": "417e87c3-6e5a-44e9-8c50-f67c4e96dadc", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/microsoft-will-require-mfa-for-all-azure-users/ba-p/4140391", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-14T15:47:01", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "abbfc013-165c-444b-bdae-6922e5e9b523", "title": "Microsoft will require MFA for all Azure users"}], "tags": {"Azure Portal": {"name": "Azure Portal", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "COVID-19": {"name": "COVID-19", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Data breach": {"name": "Data breach", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "GDPR": {"name": "GDPR", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "HIPAA": {"name": "HIPAA", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "MFA": {"name": "MFA", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Multi-factor authentication": {"name": "Multi-factor authentication", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "NIST": {"name": "NIST", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "SMS": {"name": "SMS", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "phishing": {"name": "phishing", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Microsoft will require MFA for all Azure users"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T17:17:54.002987", "id": "6255d0b3-3e54-4fbe-b39e-5abf3d2f03da", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "14"}, {"created": "2024-05-14T17:14:34.912887", "id": "dd9b1f4a-f599-48ad-af7e-1d39f48c29bf", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "5"}], "created": "2024-05-14T15:41:23", "id": "e4cb1357-96c0-46ee-9f2b-d7a076e29e8d", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Tornado Cash co-founder convicted of laundering $1.2 billion by Dutch court\nA Dutch court on Tuesday found the cofounder of the anonymizing cryptocurrency service Tornado Cash guilty of money laundering, sentencing him to five years and four months in prison.\nThe sentencing of Alexey Pertsev concludes a case that has been seen as a bellwether pitting financial privacy advocates who view blockchain anonymity as a fundamental right against law enforcement intent on tracking the source of funds.\nProsecutors contend that Tornado Cash laundered $1.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen through at least 36 hacks \u2014 including the theft of more than $600 million from the game Axie Infinity in March of 2022 and some $275 million from the crypto exchange Kucoin, both by North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group hackers.\nTornado Cash hides the origin of Ethereum transactions by allowing users to deposit currency into common pools, where the funds are mixed together, thus obfuscating their origin.\nPertsev and his fellow Tornado Cash founders have claimed that their service merely provides valuable privacy and that they are not responsible for the financial behavior of users.\n\u201cThe court disagrees.

But what if you could capture nearly all of the sun\u2019s output? Scientists think that maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 they\u2019ve detected 60 new extraterrestrial civilizations doing just that. At least, that\u2019s what it could be.\n[Freeman Dyson] popularized the idea of a Dyson sphere, an artificial sphere surrounding a sun to capture the maximum amount of energy, back in 1960. However, the idea is older and usually credited to [Olaf Stapledon]\u2019s 1937 novel Star Maker. While most people think the sphere would be solid, [Dyson] himself thought it would be a swarm of disjointed collectors owing to the difficulty in creating a solid shell of the required size.\nBoth SETI and Fermilab have searched for what is thought to be telltale infrared radiation that scientists think would emanate from a star surrounded by spheres or swarms. Several have been located, but there is no conclusive evidence.\nThe new 60 were identified by analyzing data from the Gaia satellite. Again, the evidence is not conclusive, but small and dim stars that are very bright in infrared can\u2019t be explained by conventional explanations. One way to explain at least some of the stars would be if about 16% of the star was obscured by something like a swarm of Dyson sphere collectors.\nThere are, of course, more jejune explanations possible. For example, the star might happen to be in front of some more distant IR source. Still, it is tantalizing to think there may be more than 60 high-tech civilizations out there either waiting to meet us or, perhaps, waiting to eat us, depending on how paranoid you are.\n4 thoughts on \u201cThe Alien Energy Crisis Solved\u201d\nAny civilizations capable of building and utilizing one or more Dyson spheres would look at us like we look at the first mammals after the dinosaurs were wiped out. Cute, full of potential, but of no significance. Or, to quote Douglas Adams, \u201cMostly Harmless\u201d and ripe for a bypass to come through.\nAt least we\u2019ve been upgraded from \u201cHarmless\u201d\n\u201cSeveral have been located, but there is no conclusive evidence.\u201d Pffft\u2026 Without conclusive evidence \u2013 you hane not located anything!\nIt\u2019s a sentence with subject shifting, perhaps poorly, but still\u2026\n\u201cSeveral [telltale infrared radiation that scientists think would emanate from a star] have been located, but there is no [star surrounded by spheres or swarms] conclusive evidence.\u201d\nI suppose the writer is [mis]assuming the readers familiarity with the subject.\nWe do have the ability to detect IR from stars.\nWe do not have the ability to detect swarms of collectors around those stars.\nThat\u2019s why we know for certain the former was there and no longer is, but why we can\u2019t know if this is the reason. (Hopefully that is a \u201ccan\u2019t -yet- know\u201d, but alas, physics can be very mean to us)\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Das T Phone 2 ist erschwinglich und soll lange halten.\nNeue Handys von der Deutschen Telekom: T Phone 2 und T Phone 2 Pro richten sich an Nutzer, die ein g\u00fcnstiges Handy mit l\u00e4ngerem Support suchen. Die Telekom verspricht f\u00fcr beide Modelle f\u00fcnf Jahre Sicherheitsupdates. In diesem Zeitraum bekommen die Handys aber nur zwei neue Android-Versionen \u2013 das Update-Versprechen der Telekom ist also weniger wert als bei Herstellern wie Samsung und Google, die neben Sicherheitsupdates auch regelm\u00e4\u00dfig neue Android-Versionen verteilen.\nMit den Security-Updates sind T Phone und T Phone 2 aber zumindest jahrelang ohne Sicherheitsbedenken nutzbar. Zudem sind beide neuen Telekom-Handys g\u00fcnstig: Das Einsteigermodell T Phone gibt es ohne Vertrag f\u00fcr 200 Euro, das T Phone Pro kostet 300 Euro. Angeboten werden die Handys ab dem 23. Mai.\nSnapdragon-Chip\nAngesichts des Preises d\u00fcrfen K\u00e4ufer an die Hardware keine allzu hohen Erwartungen haben. Beide Modelle arbeiten allerdings mit einem Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 \u2013 im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen Einsteiger-Handys, die auf Mediatek-Prozessoren setzen. Das Standardmodell hat 6 GByte Arbeitsspeicher, die Pro-Variante ist mit 8 GByte etwas gro\u00dfz\u00fcgiger ausgestattet. Auch der interne Speicherplatz ist beim T Phone 2 Pro mit 256 GByte gr\u00f6\u00dfer als beim T Phone 2 mit 128 GByte. Beide Modelle haben einen MicroSD-Slot zur Speichererweiterung.\nDas T Phone 2 Pro ist dem Standardmodell zudem bei der Kamera leicht \u00fcberlegen, die die Triple-Kamera mit 50 Megabyte des T Phone 2 um optische Bildstabilisierung erg\u00e4nzt. Deutliche Unterschiede gibt es beim Display: Das T Phone 2 Pro bekommt im Gegensatz zum T Phone ein AMOLED-Panel, w\u00e4hrend das T Phone mit einem IPS-Display ausgestattet ist.\nBeide Displays sind 6,8 Zoll gro\u00df, auch die Produktabmessungen sind entsprechend \u00e4hnlich. Das T Phone 2 Pro ist aber etwas schlanker, hat ein kleineres Kinn und die Frontkamera in einer Punchhole-Auskerbung oben in der Mitte, w\u00e4hrend das Standardmodell mit einer tropfenf\u00f6rmigen Notch versehen ist.\nDie Telekom betont zudem das positive Eco-Rating der beiden neuen Smartphones: Das T Phone 2 erreicht 88 Punkte, das T Phone 2 Pro 84. Damit spielen beide Handys im Ranking weit oben mit \u2013 das Eco-Rating wird aber auch wegen seiner Undurchsichtigkeit kritisiert.\nEmpfohlener redaktioneller Inhalt\nMit Ihrer Zustimmmung wird hier ein externer Preisvergleich (heise Preisvergleich) geladen.\nIch bin damit einverstanden, dass mir externe Inhalte angezeigt werden.

Das entspricht der Flugh\u00f6he eines B-2 Stealth Bombers der US-Luftwaffe.\nDie abgefeuerte pr\u00e4zisionsgelenkte Munition soll eine Geschwindigkeit \u00fcber Mach 5 und damit Hyperschallgeschwindigkeit erreicht haben. Nach etwa 3 Minuten Flug schlug sie auf dem Boden auf.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: China baut Hyperschall-Generator f\u00fcr Railguns und Laser\nWas ist eine Railgun?\nDie Railgun funktioniert \u00e4hnlich wie ein Katapult. Ein Schlitten l\u00e4uft zwischen 2 Schienen \u2013 daher auch der Name Railgun (rail = Schiene). Eine Schiene ist positiv, die andere negativ geladen. Durch den stromleitenden Schlitten wird der Kreislauf zwischen den beiden Schienen geschlossen.\nDadurch entsteht ein Magnetfeld. Dies erzeugt Lorentzkraft, bei der ein Magnetfeld Kraft auf bewegte Ladungen aus\u00fcbt. Der Schlitten wird dadurch beschleunigt, entgegen der Richtung der Energiequelle, also hin zur M\u00fcndung der Railgun. Das Projektil auf dem Schlitten wird dadurch mit extrem hoher Geschwindigkeit weggeschossen.\nVorteile von Railguns:\nMehr als die 10-fache Reichweite eines normalen Gesch\u00fctzes\n-\nGelenktes Railgun-Projektil kostet weniger als 20 Prozent einer Rakete\n-\nPlatz- und Gewichtsersparnis bei der Munition: Treibladungen f\u00fcr Granaten/Geschosse sind nicht mehr notwendig\n-\nNachteile von Railguns:\nHohe Hitze beim Schie\u00dfen besch\u00e4digt Schienen und andere Bauteile und reduziert so die Haltbarkeit\n-\nLeistungsstarke Railguns sind noch zu gro\u00df, um sie mobil einsetzen zu k\u00f6nnen\n-\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Was ist eine Railgun?\nGeplante H\u00f6he, Geschwindigkeit und Flugbahn nicht erreicht\nAllerdings war der Test ein Misserfolg. \"Das Projektil folgte nicht in der erwarteten Flugbahn und die maximale Reichweite und H\u00f6he entsprachen nicht den Designwerten\", hei\u00dft es laut SCMP in einer zugeh\u00f6rigen Studie der zur chinesischen Volksarmee geh\u00f6rigen Naval Engineering University.\nDemnach habe das Projektil im Aufstieg zu stark rotiert. Dadurch sei es in Schieflage geraten und habe die Flugbahn verlassen. Zur angepeilten Reichweite und Geschwindigkeit gibt es keine Informationen. Laut SCMP war zuvor aber von 200 km und Mach 7 die Rede gewesen sein.\nChina h\u00e4lt an Railgun fest\nDer Test hat bereits vor August 2023 stattgefunden. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt wurde das Paper eingereicht. China h\u00e4lt an der Railgun fest, w\u00e4hrend die USA das Konzept schon 2021 aufgegeben hat. Neben dem milit\u00e4rischen Einsatz soll die Entwicklung von Railguns auch in der Raumfahrt und im Transportwesen Anwendung finden.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Riesige Railgun soll chinesische Astronauten ins All schie\u00dfen\nDer Nachteil von Railguns sind einerseits die hohen Kosten. Zudem m\u00fcssen die Geschosse - seien es Bomben oder sp\u00e4ter Satelliten - enormen Kr\u00e4ften von etwa 3.500g standhalten. Zum Vergleich: Bei einem normalen Raketenstart wirken 3g auf die Fracht.\nIm milit\u00e4rischen Bereich ist vor allem die Haltbarkeit einer Railgun ein Problem.

Ein einfacher Roboterhund, der mit Greifern ausgestattet ist, k\u00f6nnte sich im Haushalt n\u00fctzlich machen.\nEin Forschungsteam des Fachbereichs Maschinenbau der Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) hat in Zusammenarbeit mit Google DeepMind und der University of Washington einen Go1-Roboterhund von Unitree so umgebaut, dass er in Zukunft dazu genutzt werden kann, im Haushalt zu helfen.\nRoboterhunde werden meist zu \u00dcberwachungs- und Rettungsaufgaben herangezogen. Auch deshalb, weil sie daf\u00fcr pr\u00e4destiniert sind, sich auf ihren vier Beinen durch beliebiges Gel\u00e4nde zu bewegen. Als Helfer im Haushalt kommen sie eigentlich nicht infrage, weil ihnen dazu die geeigneten Manipulatoren \u2013 etwa in Form von Greifern \u2013 fehlen.\nDie CMU-Forscher haben f\u00fcr den Unitree-Go-Roboterhund deshalb spezielle, leichtgewichtige Manipulatoren entwickelt und sie in die Vorderbeine integriert. Dabei handelt es sich um Greifer mit zwei Fingern, die zus\u00e4tzlich in drei Freiheitgraden bewegt werden k\u00f6nnen, wie aus dem wissenschaftlichen Paper \"LocoMan: Advancing Versatile Quadrupedal Dexterity with Lightweight Loco-Manipulators\" hervorgeht, der auf Arxiv im Preprint erschienen ist.\nUm die Manipulatoren herzustellen, griffen die Wissenschaftler auf vier Servos sowie diversen Teilen aus dem 3D-Drucker zur\u00fcck. Die Greifer sind vielseitig genug, um damit T\u00fcren zu \u00f6ffnen, Getr\u00e4nke einzuschenken, Mobiltelefone zum Aufladen einzustecken und hinter Kleinkindern hinterher zu r\u00e4umen.\nDer Vorteil dabei ist, dass dazu ein recht preiswerter Roboter genutzt werden kann, der etwa im Vergleich zu einem humanoiden Roboter deutlich g\u00fcnstiger zu bauen ist. So kostet ein Unitree Go2-Roboterhund, das Nachfolgemodell des verwendeten Go1, etwa 1600 US-Dollar.\n\"W\u00e4hrend viele an humanoiden Robotern arbeiten, die wie Menschen aussehen und das Potenzial haben, direkt vom Menschen zu lernen oder ihn sogar bei einigen Aufgaben zu ersetzen, konzentrieren wir uns auf Roboter, die den Menschen erg\u00e4nzen und mit ihm zusammenarbeiten k\u00f6nnen\", sagt Ding Zhao, Professor f\u00fcr Maschinenbau an der CMU.\nEinfache Objektmanipulationen\nLocoMan ist bereits in der Lage, einfache Aufgaben durchzuf\u00fchren. Dazu geh\u00f6rte das \u00d6ffnen von T\u00fcren, das Aufnehmen von Objekten und Stecker in die Steckdose stecken. Dies testeten die Wissenschaftler in einer Vorschulklasse des Cyert Center for Early Education. Den Kindern wurde der Roboter erkl\u00e4rt und gezeigt, wie sie ihn verwenden k\u00f6nnen.

Dazu wollen sie seine Wahrnehmungsf\u00e4higkeiten sowie F\u00e4higkeiten zur Intelligenzplanung in seine Ganzk\u00f6rpersteuerung integrieren.\nDie Wissenschaftler rund um Zhao nehmen an, dass LocoMan in etwa drei Jahren so weit sein wird, dass er im Haushalt oder in Kinderg\u00e4rten helfen und etwa hinter Kindern hinterherr\u00e4umen kann.

For this to work, Elasticsearch needs to index all data we want to search for, so that it can retrieve it quickly when requested. Once the data is indexed, all works as expected, our users are happy, our developers are happy, and life is good.\nHowever, I recently tested something I haven\u2019t tried in a while: indexing a fairly large database (with 100 million posts) completely from scratch. When the database is already indexed, subsequent indexes of new posts and files are quite fast, so the normal usage of Elasticsearch is flawless, but an index from scratch is slow:\nThis screenshot is our job system informing us that the Elasticsearch indexing job has been running for around 18 hours, and hasn\u2019t even finished half of what it needs to do \ud83d\ude41 And the progress was not linear, slowing down more and more the further it progressed! Something was clearly wrong here.\nThe culprit\nLet\u2019s start the investigation by identifying what exactly is slow here, since there are many moving parts: it could be the database, the Mattermost server, the Elasticsearch server, the network, or an under-resourced machine.\nLooking at our Mattermost Performance Monitoring Grafana dashboard while the indexing job was running, the problem was crystal clear at first sight:\nThe graph above shows the top 10 database calls by duration, which comes down (simplifying it a bit) to the following Prometheus query:\ntopk(10,\nsum(increase(mattermost_db_store_time_sum[5m])) by (method)\n/\nsum(increase(mattermost_db_store_time_count[5m])) by (method)\n)\nWe measure the time it takes for each database method to finish, averaged over the last 5 minutes, and we plot that by second, showing only the top 10 methods.\nAnd looking at the graph, there\u2019s a clear outlier there: PostStore.GetPostsBatchForIndexing\n, which is taking more and more time as the indexing job progresses, eventually hitting the 30 seconds mark, when it simply times out. Looking at the code, we see the exact query that\u2019s causing all these problems:\nSELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId\nFROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id\nWHERE\nPosts.CreateAt > ?1\nOR\n(Posts.CreateAt = ?1 AND Posts.Id > ?2)\nORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC\nLIMIT ?3;\nThis query does a simple job: it orders all posts by their creation timestamp and returns the first N (a limit provided by the caller) posts that are newer than a provided timestamp. The query needs to check the ID of the post and cover the rare case of two posts happening simultaneously. It also joins with the Channels table, but only to return the post\u2019s TeamId along with its other data.\nThe indexing job is then built on top of this query, running it over and over again until all posts are indexed. In pseudo-code, it looks something like this:\nfunc IndexingJob() {\nt := 0\nid := \"\"\nlimit := 1000\nfor {\n// Run the query\nbatch := GetPostsBatchForIndexing(t, id, limit)\n// Index the posts returned by the query\nelasticsearchService.Index(batch)\n// Stop when we get less than `limit` posts\nif len(batch) < limit {\nbreak\n}\n// Update the timestamp and id to newest post's\nnewestPost := batch[len(batch)-1]\nt = newestPost.CreateAt\nid = newestPost.Id\n}\n}\nThe first investigation\nNow that we understand what we\u2019re dealing with and what piece of the whole system is misbehaving, we can start the real investigation.\nTrying to optimize a SQL query never follows a predefined plan, but one can apply some methodologies that can help find the problem and possibly the solution faster and more consistently. I didn\u2019t do any of that, though, and my investigation was chaotic and instinct-driven at first. Never do this at home.\nMy first concern with this query was: why on earth does it take longer and longer each time it gets executed? The answer was actually pretty simple, but I had no idea at the beginning. So the first thing I looked at was the data I already had at hand: the AWS Performance insights of the query:\nThis gave me the first clue: the query spends nearly 100% of its running time on CPU. This means the query is not bottlenecked by the time it takes to read or write data, but by the time it takes to process that data. Interesting.\nThen I started playing with the query. The first thing I did was, of course, run an EXPLAIN ANALYZE\n. Lately, I\u2019ve gotten into the habit of adding the BUFFERS\noption to this, so the EXPLAIN\ngives a bit more data. There\u2019s a fantastic blog post on the BUFFERS\noption, so I won\u2019t go into much detail here, but by copying the definition from pgMustard, which is short and to the point, we can understand what this does:\nBUFFERS extends EXPLAIN by adding values to describe the data read/written by each operation.\nWe\u2019re not only getting info on the query plan, but also on the actual data we move around. Neat.\nNow, choosing some data for the arguments the query receives (the timestamp, the post ID and the limit), I ran EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)\nand got the following result:\nmmdb=> EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId FROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id WHERE Posts.CreateAt > '1687424888405' OR (Posts.CreateAt = '1687424888405' AND Posts.Id > 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h') ORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC LIMIT 10000;\nQUERY PLAN\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLimit (cost=1.22..2287.94 rows=10000 width=464) (actual time=23921.236..23954.229 rows=10000 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=40557115\n-> Incremental Sort (cost=1.22..13998881.93 rows=61217938 width=464) (actual time=23921.235..23953.205 rows=10000 loops=1)\nSort Key: posts.createat, posts.id\nPresorted Key: posts.createat\nFull-sort Groups: 311 Sort Method: quicksort Average Memory: 45kB Peak Memory: 45kB\nBuffers: shared hit=40557115\n-> Nested Loop Left Join (cost=1.00..11421751.31 rows=61217938 width=464) (actual time=23920.970..23947.067 rows=10001 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=40557115\n-> Index Scan using idx_posts_create_at on posts (cost=0.57..9889434.54 rows=61217938 width=461) (actual time=23920.930..23931.063 rows=10001 loops=1)\nFilter: ((createat > '1687424888405'::bigint) OR ((createat = '1687424888405'::bigint) AND ((id)::text > 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h'::text)))\nRows Removed by Filter: 40920000\nBuffers: shared hit=40553119\n-> Memoize (cost=0.43..0.70 rows=1 width=30) (actual time=0.001..0.001 rows=1 loops=10001)\nCache Key: posts.channelid\nCache Mode: logical\nHits: 9002 Misses: 999 Evictions: 0 Overflows: 0 Memory Usage: 151kB\nBuffers: shared hit=3996\n-> Index Scan using channels_pkey on channels (cost=0.42..0.69 rows=1 width=30) (actual time=0.007..0.007 rows=1 loops=999)\nIndex Cond: ((id)::text = (posts.channelid)::text)\nBuffers: shared hit=3996\nPlanning:\nBuffers: shared hit=112\nPlanning Time: 0.501 ms\nExecution Time: 23954.974 ms\n(25 rows)\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a lot to digest. Some key points:\nThe second-to-last line, the execution time, says this query took around 24 seconds to finish. This is what we want to fix.\n-\nThe query plan shows the nodes. From inner to outer:\nFirst, a couple of Index scan nodes:\nOne on the Posts table, with a Filter applying the WHERE condition, using an index covering the CreateAt field. Why is it not using the other index this table has on (CreateAt, Id), though? We don\u2019t know yet.\n-\nAnother on the Channels table, with an Index Cond applying the join condition (the post\u2019s ID equals the channel\u2019s ID), using the the index on the primary key, which is the ID.\n-\n-\nThen, it performs the JOIN itself between the Posts and Channels table.\n-\nFinally, it does an Incremental Sort, using Posts.CreateAt and Posts.Id as the sort keys, noting that we have an already sorted key, Posts.CreateAt, due to the fact that we used the idx_posts_create_at index before.\n-\n-\nFirst, a couple of Index scan nodes:\n-\nThe number of shared hit buffers is forty million on the Index Scan node for the Posts table and on the wrapping Nested Loop Left Join node. That\u2019s a lot.\n-\nPoint 3 here is important. Although the number of hits inside a nested loop has its nuances, it\u2019s something that gives us another clue: here\u2019s where the CPU is being spent. Even if this doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re reading 40 million blocks from the cache (we would need a pretty large cache for that), it means we are processing 40 million blocks. We can check how much data this means, actually:\nmmdb=> SELECT pg_size_pretty(40557115 * current_setting('block_size')::bigint);\npg_size_pretty\n----------------\n309 GB\n(1 row)\nSo that query is processing three hundred gigabytes. Not bad.\nThe first solution\nThe first thing I tried to solve this was to remove the JOIN\nwith the Channels\ntable. Both tables are pretty large, so I was worried this was adding a lot of overhead to the query. That ended up not being the case. The time taken on the query without the JOIN\nwas virtually the same as with it.\nWhat next, then? The next step was mostly luck. I wanted to keep understanding the query, so I kept simplifying it. If the JOIN was not the problem, the only other complexity was in the WHERE\ncondition: CreateAt > t OR (CreateAt = t AND Id > id)\n.\nSo I ran EXPLAIN\nwith the query skipping the second part of the OR\n; i.e.:\nSELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId\nFROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id\nWHERE Posts.CreateAt > ?1 -- <- only the first condition here\nORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC\nLIMIT ?3;\nAnd I got a very interesting result:\nmmdb=> EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId FROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id WHERE Posts.CreateAt > '1687424888405' ORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC LIMIT 10000;\nQUERY PLAN\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLimit (cost=1.14..1616.83 rows=10000 width=464) (actual time=0.347..33.077 rows=10000 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=13949\n-> Incremental Sort (cost=1.14..9890887.64 rows=61217938 width=464) (actual time=0.346..32.054 rows=10000 loops=1)\nSort Key: posts.createat, posts.id\nPresorted Key: posts.createat\nFull-sort Groups: 311 Sort Method: quicksort Average Memory: 45kB Peak Memory: 45kB\nBuffers: shared hit=13949\n-> Nested Loop Left Join (cost=1.00..7313757.02 rows=61217938 width=464) (actual time=0.053..25.892 rows=10001 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=13949\n-> Index Scan using idx_posts_create_at on posts (cost=0.57..5781440.25 rows=61217938 width=461) (actual time=0.032..9.802 rows=10001 loops=1)\nIndex Cond: (createat > '1687424888405'::bigint)\nBuffers: shared hit=9953\n-> Memoize (cost=0.43..0.70 rows=1 width=30) (actual time=0.001..0.001 rows=1 loops=10001)\nCache Key: posts.channelid\nCache Mode: logical\nHits: 9002 Misses: 999 Evictions: 0 Overflows: 0 Memory Usage: 151kB\nBuffers: shared hit=3996\n-> Index Scan using channels_pkey on channels (cost=0.42..0.69 rows=1 width=30) (actual time=0.007..0.007 rows=1 loops=999)\nIndex Cond: ((id)::text = (posts.channelid)::text)\nBuffers: shared hit=3996\nPlanning:\nBuffers: shared hit=112\nPlanning Time: 0.440 ms\nExecution Time: 33.735 ms\n(24 rows)\nSee that execution time? That\u2019s 30 milliseconds, or ~1000 times less than the original query! And the shared hit buffers is at 13949, or a more sane 109 MiB. Before I could keep looking at this plan, I immediately tried to run a query with only the second part of the OR\ncondition; i.e.:\nSELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId\nFROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id\nWHERE Posts.CreateAt = ?1 AND Posts.Id > ?2 -- <- only the second condition here\nORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC\nLIMIT ?3;\nWithout thinking too much about it, I honestly expected this to take around 24 seconds again, so that I could focus on optimizing only this part. But here\u2019s what I got:\nagnivaltdb=> EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId FROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id WHERE Posts.CreateAt = '1687424888405' AND Posts.Id > 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h' ORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC LIMIT 10000;\nQUERY PLAN\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLimit (cost=0.99..17.03 rows=1 width=464) (actual time=0.015..0.015 rows=0 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=4\n-> Nested Loop Left Join (cost=0.99..17.03 rows=1 width=464) (actual time=0.014..0.014 rows=0 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=4\n-> Index Scan using idx_posts_create_at_id on posts (cost=0.57..8.59 rows=1 width=461) (actual time=0.013..0.013 rows=0 loops=1)\nIndex Cond: ((createat = '1687424888405'::bigint) AND ((id)::text > 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h'::text))\nBuffers: shared hit=4\n-> Index Scan using channels_pkey on channels (cost=0.42..8.44 rows=1 width=30) (never executed)\nIndex Cond: ((id)::text = (posts.channelid)::text)\nPlanning:\nBuffers: shared hit=112\nPlanning Time: 0.437 ms\nExecution Time: 0.047 ms\n(13 rows)\nIt took 0.047 milliseconds!!!! That\u2019s\u2026 well, ~500000 (five hundred thousand) times quicker than the original query. What????\nAh, wait, it returned no rows, that makes sense. And it didn\u2019t return rows because it covers a quite rare case, since we\u2019re looking for a post happening in the same millisecond as another one and whose ID is larger than the given one. Not impossible, but not frequent either.\nBut the important question was: where did my original 24 seconds go? Why are these two separate queries taking 30 milliseconds in total instead of 30 seconds?\nI still had too many questions and not enough answers, but I made a decision: I\u2019ll split the original query into those two, run them one after the other, and collect the results in the Mattermost server code afterwards. It will make the code a bit more complex, but it\u2019ll be worth it. I\u2019ll do that tomorrow morning, I said to myself.\nActually understanding everything\nI didn\u2019t do that the next morning either, of course, and I instead went back to understand what was happening. Why were we getting so many shared hit buffers in the original query? Why was it taking longer each time it got executed? Why did the split queries return the exact same answer but 1000 times faster?\nWell, I already had all data I needed to understand everything; it\u2019s just that I hadn\u2019t paid the attention it deserved.\nLooking back at the query plans of the original query and the one filtering only by CreateAt > ...\n, we see a very important difference. Let\u2019s look a bit closer to the Index Scan\nnode in both cases.\nFirst, the original query:\n-> Index Scan using idx_posts_create_at on posts (cost=0.57..9889434.54 rows=61217938 width=461) (actual time=23920.930..23931.063 rows=10001 loops=1)\nFilter: ((createat > '1687424888405'::bigint) OR ((createat = '1687424888405'::bigint) AND ((id)::text > 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h'::text)))\nRows Removed by Filter: 40920000\nBuffers: shared hit=40553119\nNow, the one filtering only by CreateAt > ...\n:\n-> Index Scan using idx_posts_create_at on posts (cost=0.57..5781440.25 rows=61217938 width=461) (actual time=0.032..9.802 rows=10001 loops=1)\nIndex Cond: (createat > '1687424888405'::bigint)\nBuffers: shared hit=9953\nDid you spot the difference? The first one uses a Filter\n, removing 40 million rows in the process, while the second one uses an Index Cond\n, just checking the index itself.\nAnd that\u2019s the main difference. Going back to the short and to-the-point descriptions of pgMustard:\nIndex Cond is the condition used to find the locations of rows from the index. Postgres uses the structured nature of the index to quickly jump to the rows it\u2019s looking for.\nAlthough similar in purpose to \u201cFilter\u201d, the implementation is completely different. In a \u201cFilter\u201d, rows are retrieved and then discarded based on their values. As such, you can find an \u201cIndex Cond\u201d and a \u201cFilter\u201d on the same operation.\nSo that\u2019s the key difference: the original query is going through all the rows in the Posts\ntable, then discarding or keeping them based on the condition, while the second one just looks at the index and retrieves the rows it needs. One question answered!\nBut this also explains why the query takes longer and longer each time it gets executed: as it orders the posts from oldest to newest, and each query uses the newest timestamp of the last batch, it needs to discard more and more rows each time. To see this more clearly, let\u2019s say our Posts table has 1000 posts, and we index batches of 100 posts each time. Then the job runs as follows:\nThe first batch will return posts 0 to 99, discarding no posts at all, so it will be quite fast. In total, it has processed 100 posts, as one could expect.\n-\nThe second batch will return posts 100 to 199, but only after having discarded the first 100 posts. Those first 100 posts were read, though, so in total, it has processed 200 posts.\n-\nThe third batch will return posts 200 to 299, discarding the first 200 posts. That\u2019s 300 posts processed in total.\n-\n\u2026\n-\n\u2026\n-\n\u2026\n-\nThe tenth and last batch will return posts 900 to 999, discarding the first 900 posts. This last batch processed 1000 posts, that is, the whole table.\n-\nMy other two questions have been answered as well: the original query had so many shared hit buffers and was taking longer and longer simply because it was eventually going through the one hundred million posts in our database. Poor query.\nThe beautiful solution\nAlthough it\u2019s true that we now understand everything, we are still left with the original task: split the original query in two, run them independently, and collect the results afterwards in the server.\nBut there\u2019s an alternative, though! Now that I understand everything, I was able to look for similar cases with the exact incantation needed to summon the gods of StackOverflow. And they delivered. Thank you, StackOverflow. And thank you, Laurenz Albe.\nIt turns out there\u2019s a handy feature in PostgreSQL called row constructor comparisons that allows me to compare tuples of columns. That\u2019s exactly what we need. Instead of doing CreateAt > ?1 OR (CreateAt = ?1 AND Id > ?2)\n, we can do (CreateAt, Id) > (?1, ?2)\n. And the row constructor comparisons are lexicographical, meaning that it\u2019s semantically the same as what we had before!\nSo we just need to convert our original query to the following:\nSELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId\nFROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id\nWHERE (Posts.CreateAt, Posts.Id) > (?1, ?2) -- <- lexicographical comparisons to the rescue!\nORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC\nLIMIT ?3;\nAnd what\u2019s the result? Well, let\u2019s see:\nmmdb=> EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId FROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id WHERE (Posts.CreateAt, Posts.Id) > ('1687424888405', 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h') ORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC LIMIT 10000;\nQUERY PLAN\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLimit (cost=1.15..1666.83 rows=10000 width=464) (actual time=0.366..34.053 rows=10000 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=13951\n-> Incremental Sort (cost=1.15..10196977.36 rows=61217938 width=464) (actual time=0.365..33.031 rows=10000 loops=1)\nSort Key: posts.createat, posts.id\nPresorted Key: posts.createat\nFull-sort Groups: 311 Sort Method: quicksort Average Memory: 45kB Peak Memory: 45kB\nBuffers: shared hit=13951\n-> Nested Loop Left Join (cost=1.00..7619846.74 rows=61217938 width=464) (actual time=0.059..26.840 rows=10001 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=13951\n-> Index Scan using idx_posts_create_at on posts (cost=0.57..6087529.97 rows=61217938 width=461) (actual time=0.040..10.548 rows=10001 loops=1)\nIndex Cond: (createat >= '1687424888405'::bigint)\nFilter: (ROW(createat, (id)::text) > ROW('1687424888405'::bigint, 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h'::text))\nRows Removed by Filter: 2\nBuffers: shared hit=9955\n-> Memoize (cost=0.43..0.70 rows=1 width=30) (actual time=0.001..0.001 rows=1 loops=10001)\nCache Key: posts.channelid\nCache Mode: logical\nHits: 9002 Misses: 999 Evictions: 0 Overflows: 0 Memory Usage: 151kB\nBuffers: shared hit=3996\n-> Index Scan using channels_pkey on channels (cost=0.42..0.69 rows=1 width=30) (actual time=0.007..0.007 rows=1 loops=999)\nIndex Cond: ((id)::text = (posts.channelid)::text)\nBuffers: shared hit=3996\nPlanning:\nBuffers: shared hit=112\nPlanning Time: 0.471 ms\nExecution Time: 34.716 ms\n(26 rows)\n34 milliseconds, yay! A query that\u2019s 1000 times faster, and that\u2019s even more readable than the original one, a textbook win-win.\nIf you take a look at the Index Scan\nnode, you\u2019ll notice that PostgreSQL is now using an Index Cond\n, thus checking the index to find those posts, and only afterwards applying a Filter. The shared hit buffers went down to 9955, which is only 78 MiB. Isn\u2019t it beautiful?\n(Why the query planner doesn\u2019t automatically convert a condition like x > a OR (x == a AND y > b)\nto (x, y) > (a, b)\nis something I still don\u2019t understand to this day, though.)\nThe solution we need\nSo I was done. But then I remembered that we not only support PostgreSQL, but also MySQL. And that made me shiver.\nOf course, the behaviour in MySQL was the complete opposite \ud83d\ude41\nLet\u2019s run an EXPLAIN ANALYZE\n(no BUFFERS\nin MySQL, sorry) on the query running in MySQL. First, the original one:\nmysql> EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId FROM Posts USE INDEX(idx_posts_create_at_id) LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id WHERE Posts.CreateAt > 1557752415221 OR (Posts.CreateAt = 1557752415221 AND Posts.Id > 'ad59ire57tfwmjr5r8xqxc75qw') ORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC LIMIT 10000;\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| -> Limit: 10000 row(s) (cost=7472068.91 rows=10000) (actual time=0.063..164.174 rows=10000 loops=1)\n-> Nested loop left join (cost=7472068.91 rows=5559093) (actual time=0.062..163.450 rows=10000 loops=1)\n-> Index range scan on Posts using idx_posts_create_at_id over (CreateAt = 1557752415221 AND 'ad59ire57tfwmjr5r8xqxc75qw' < Id) OR (1557752415221 < CreateAt), with index condition: ((Posts.CreateAt > 1557752415221) or ((Posts.CreateAt = 1557752415221) and (Posts.Id > 'ad59ire57tfwmjr5r8xqxc75qw'))) (cost=1357066.29 rows=5559093) (actual time=0.043..97.358 rows=10000 loops=1)\n-> Single-row index lookup on Channels using PRIMARY (Id=Posts.ChannelId) (cost=1.00 rows=1) (actual time=0.006..0.006 rows=1 loops=10000)\n|\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n1 row in set (0.18 sec)\n0.18 seconds.

Uuuugh.\nThis outcome had no easy escape: I had to split the code flow in two, using the good-looking query when using PostgreSQL, and the original one when using MySQL. And that\u2019s the change that finally got merged. A bit sad, but it is what it is.\nWhat we learned\nThis was a fun journey after all, and definitely a good optimization: who doesn\u2019t love making something a thousand times faster? It ended up landing on v9.7.0 and later, and got backported to the 9.5 ESR as well, starting in v9.5.3.\nAlso, I learned a couple of very interesting things:\nAlways use BUFFERS\nwhen running anEXPLAIN\n. It gives some data that may be crucial for the investigation.\n-\nAlways, always try to get an Index Cond\n(calledIndex range scan\nin MySQL) instead of aFilter\n.\n-\nAlways, always, always assume PostgreSQL and MySQL will behave differently. Because they do.\n-", "hash": "1c70b1ae8a983059e3842fe9d2106def0f85789aad768ace51b604ef5d30f453", "id": "04c03efc-9221-4f99-99c8-f4a13332e86c", "link": "https://mattermost.com/blog/making-a-postgres-query-1000-times-faster/", "osint_source_id": "2d88a2c2-3767-419d-ae64-6975e45577be", "published": "2024-05-14T15:00:00", "source": "https://mattermost.com/feed/", "story_id": "23a5a9fc-e908-4a50-8f27-96d5be127ced", "title": "Making a Postgres query 1,000 times faster"}], "tags": {"Elasticsearch": {"name": "Elasticsearch", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Mattermost": {"name": "Mattermost", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "MySQL": {"name": "MySQL", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "PostgreSQL": {"name": "PostgreSQL", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Postgres": {"name": "Postgres", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Uuuugh": {"name": "Uuuugh", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Making a Postgres query 1,000 times faster"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T17:11:53.666864", "id": "53ea95c6-97e6-43d8-92dd-dfc71b4ac6f6", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}, {"created": "2024-05-14T17:31:02.963269", "id": "bbb7ec36-99e8-42aa-8921-d5c93950362a", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "27"}], "created": "2024-05-14T15:00:00", "id": "fe5dbfd1-e332-4628-84da-e33a2dba097c", "news_items": [{"author": "Isabel Gr\u00fcnewald", "content": "KI-Update kompakt: GPT-4o, Claude in Europa, Grok im Test, KI in der Medizin\nDas \"KI-Update\" liefert werkt\u00e4glich eine Zusammenfassung der wichtigsten KI-Entwicklungen.\nIsabel Gr\u00fcnewald\n-\nThe Decoder\n-\nOpenAI pr\u00e4sentiert GPT-4o\nOpenAI hat im Rahmen des Spring-Updates das neue Modell GPT-4o vorgestellt, ein \"Omnimodel\" f\u00fcr k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz, das Audio-, Text- und Bildverarbeitung nativ integriert.

Das Modell wurde mit Daten bis 2023 trainiert und zeigt bei politisch sensiblen Themen eine klare chinesische Perspektive, etwa bei Fragen ums Tianmen-Massaker.\nDeepSeek-VL, eine Reihe multimodaler Sprachmodelle, bildet die Basis f\u00fcr den Chat. Diese Modelle k\u00f6nnen visuelle und sprachliche Informationen aus verschiedenen Quellen verarbeiten und zeigen vielversprechende Leistungen bei der Objekterkennung in Bildern. Der Chat selbst verarbeitet derzeit nur Text und hat im Vergleich zu ChatGPT-4 noch Defizite.\nAls Open-Source-Projekt stehen die DeepSeek-Modelle auf GitHub und HuggingFace zur Verf\u00fcgung. Das Unternehmen plant, die Modelle weiterzuentwickeln und MoE-Architekturen zu integrieren. F\u00fcr Entwickler bietet DeepSeek SDKs und APIs, die mit OpenAI kompatibel sind.\nKI kann l\u00fcgen und betr\u00fcgen\nSysteme mit K\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz sind in der Lage, Menschen zu t\u00e4uschen \u2013 selbst wenn sie darauf trainiert wurden, hilfreich und ehrlich zu sein. Das ist das Ergebnis einer \u00dcbersichtsstudie von Forschenden am Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), die in der Fachzeitschrift \"Patterns\" ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde. Als auff\u00e4lligstes Beispiel f\u00fcr eine manipulative KI nennen die Autorinnen und Autoren das vom Facebook-Konzern Meta entwickelte KI-System Cicero, das im Brettspiel-Klassiker \"Diplomacy\" gegen menschliche Mitspieler antreten kann. Diplomacy simuliert die Machtverh\u00e4ltnisse in Europa vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg.\nDas MIT-Wissenschaftsteam fand nun heraus, dass Cicero oft nicht fair gespielt habe, obwohl Meta behaupte, das KI-System angewiesen zu haben, seine menschlichen Verb\u00fcndeten w\u00e4hrend des Spiels \"niemals absichtlich zu hintergehen\". Die Forschenden st\u00fctzen ihre Bewertung auf Daten, die von Meta selbst in Verbindung mit einem wissenschaftlichen Paper zu Cicero ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurden. Auch KI-Systeme von OpenAI und Google seien in der Lage, Menschen zu t\u00e4uschen.\n\"Wenn KI die F\u00e4higkeit zur T\u00e4uschung erlernt, kann sie von b\u00f6swilligen Akteuren, die absichtlich Schaden anrichten wollen, effizienter eingesetzt werden\", hei\u00dft es in der \u00dcbersichtsstudie. Die Forschenden fordern die Politik auf, so schnell wie m\u00f6glich strenge Vorschriften zu entwickeln, um KI-Systeme in die Schranken zu weisen.\nKI Grok von Elon Musk im Test\nElon Musks KI-Firma X.AI entwickelte den Chatbot Grok, der \u00fcber ein X-Premium-Abo verf\u00fcgbar ist. Ein Vergleichstest offenbart Schw\u00e4chen: Grok zeigt veraltete und falsche Informationen an, da er nur auf Tweets zugreift und Trainingsdaten bis April 2023 nutzt. Auch wenn Grok laut Musk weniger politisch korrekt sein soll, vermeidet der Bot politisch unkorrekte Aussagen. Obwohl Grok Teil des kostenpflichtigen X Premium Abos in Deutschland ist, l\u00e4sst sich der Chatbot hierzulande nur mittels VPN nutzen.\nBei einfachen Aufgaben wie Coding oder Ausflugstipps f\u00fcr Hannover schneidet Grok \u00e4hnlich wie die Konkurrenz ab, halluziniert jedoch bei ungew\u00f6hnlichen Fragen. Deutsche Witze gelingen ihm kaum. Insgesamt liegt Grok im Vergleich zu GPT-4, Claude 3 oder dem deutlich kleineren Open-Source-Modell Lama im unteren Durchschnitt.\nEine neue Version 1.5 mit zus\u00e4tzlichen Bildf\u00e4higkeiten ist angek\u00fcndigt. Trotz hoher Entwicklungskosten und enormer Rechenleistung \u00fcberzeugt die getestete Version 1.0 jedoch nicht. Es bleibt abzuwarten, ob zuk\u00fcnftige Versionen Grok konkurrenzf\u00e4hig machen.\nDas ganze Test-Video findet ihr im YouTube-Kanal von c\u2019t 3003.\nKI-generierte Kinderpornografie stellt Ermittler vor neue Herausforderungen\nIn einer Antwort auf eine kleine Anfrage der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion gibt die Bundesregierung Einblick in ihre Einsch\u00e4tzungen und vorliegenden Zahlen zu KI-generierten Darstellungen sexuellen Kindesmissbrauchs. Zwar sei bekannt, dass es das Ph\u00e4nomen gebe und die Anzahl steigen w\u00fcrde. Allerdings gebe es zum Gesamtumfang derzeit keine validen Zahlen, antwortet die Bundesregierung. Ein Indiz w\u00e4ren allerdings die vom National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) gemeldeten Inhalte: etwa 4700 Reports zu KI-generierten Missbrauchsdarstellungen habe die private US-Institution mitgeteilt. Sie wiederum bezieht ihre Informationen im Wesentlichen von privaten Plattformbetreibern wie Meta oder Google.\nDie gro\u00dfen KI-Anbieter w\u00fcrden versuchen, mit Sicherheitsmechanismen die Generierung zu unterbinden \u2013 allerdings gebe es Umgehungsstrategien und Anleitungen zur Umgehung f\u00fcr diese sogenannten Ethik-Filter im Netz. Die CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete Catarina dos Santos-Wintz sieht ihre Bef\u00fcrchtungen best\u00e4tigt, dass K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz zunehmend missbraucht werde, um kinder- und jugendpornografisches Foto- und Filmmaterial zu erstellen. Sie fordert daher auch von Open-Source-KI den Einsatz solcher Ethik-Filter, um die Erstellung derartiger Inhalte zu verhindern.\nDeutscher \u00c4rztetag fordert Rechtsrahmen f\u00fcr KI in der Medizin\nAuf dem 128. Deutschen \u00c4rztetag haben die Delegierten mit gro\u00dfer Mehrheit beschlossen, dass sich der Vorstand der Bundes\u00e4rztekammer f\u00fcr einen verantwortungsvollen Umgang mit K\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz einsetzen soll. Sie fordern einen verbindlichen Rechtsrahmen, der sich an den Vorgaben der EU-KI-Verordnung und der Europaratskonvention orientiert. Dabei m\u00fcssen Menschenrechte sowie demokratische und rechtsstaatliche Prinzipien gewahrt bleiben. KI d\u00fcrfe ausschlie\u00dflich dem Wohle des Menschen dienen.\nF\u00fcr die KI-Systeme fordern die Medizinerinnen und Mediziner qualit\u00e4tsgesicherte Daten. \"KI-Systeme, die auf mit maschinellem Lernen aus Daten gewonnenen Modellen basieren, d\u00fcrfen nicht zur Blackbox werden\", hei\u00dft es in dem angenommenen Beschlussantrag. Auch m\u00fcsse nachvollziehbar sein, \"welche Entscheidungsparameter ein Algorithmus verwendet\". KI-Systeme, die nicht den Werten Deutschlands und Europas entsprechen, sollen nicht zum Einsatz kommen. Verst\u00f6\u00dfe sollen sanktioniert werden, so die Forderung.\n(igr)", "hash": "4114baf58b6f87628604c9fe1cd6f00bb8148aece1f7a13ed941a6897dc6435e", "id": "7d6427ac-0f99-4bc7-a1e6-2e0963253a4f", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/KI-Update-kompakt-GPT-4o-Claude-in-Europa-Grok-im-Test-KI-in-der-Medizin-9717143.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-14T15:00:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "fe5dbfd1-e332-4628-84da-e33a2dba097c", "title": "KI-Update kompakt: GPT-4o, Claude in Europa, Grok im Test, KI in der Medizin"}], "tags": {"CDU": {"name": "CDU", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Catarina dos Santos-Wintz": {"name": "Catarina dos Santos-Wintz", "tag_type": "PER"}, "China": {"name": "China", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Cicero": {"name": "Cicero", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Claude": {"name": "Claude", "tag_type": "PER"}, "DeepSeek-AI": {"name": "DeepSeek-AI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Deutschland": {"name": "Deutschland", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Deutschlands": {"name": "Deutschlands", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Diplomacy": {"name": "Diplomacy", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Europa": {"name": "Europa", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Europas": {"name": "Europas", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "GPT-4o": {"name": "GPT-4o", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Google": {"name": "Google", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Hannover": {"name": "Hannover", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Huangzhou": {"name": "Huangzhou", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Isabel Gr\u00fcnewald": {"name": "Isabel Gr\u00fcnewald", "tag_type": "PER"}, "MIT": {"name": "MIT", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Meta": {"name": "Meta", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Musk": {"name": "Musk", "tag_type": "PER"}, "NCMEC": {"name": "NCMEC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Omnimodel": {"name": "Omnimodel", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Open-Source-KI": {"name": "Open-Source-KI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "OpenAI": {"name": "OpenAI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Patterns": {"name": "Patterns", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Sam Altman": {"name": "Sam Altman", "tag_type": "PER"}, "X.AI": {"name": "X.AI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "igr": {"name": "igr", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "KI-Update kompakt: GPT-4o, Claude in Europa, Grok im Test, KI in der Medizin"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T17:31:02.988312", "id": "cab73fd8-41b5-441e-ba9f-4cb428bcc057", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "3"}], "created": "2024-05-14T15:00:00", "id": "a31b139a-1ddf-45b7-bc19-dd76d825ceaa", "news_items": [{"author": "Leo Becker", "content": "App-Store-Konkurrenz: Setapp bringt App-Flatrate h\u00e4ppchenweise auf iPhones\nEin bekanntes Entwicklerstudio nutzt die von der EU erzwungene iOS-\u00d6ffnung, um ihre App-Flatrate auf iPhones zu bringen.

For this to work, Elasticsearch needs to index all data we want to search for, so that it can retrieve it quickly when requested. Once the data is indexed, all works as expected, our users are happy, our developers are happy, and life is good.\nHowever, I recently tested something I haven\u2019t tried in a while: indexing a fairly large database (with 100 million posts) completely from scratch. When the database is already indexed, subsequent indexes of new posts and files are quite fast, so the normal usage of Elasticsearch is flawless, but an index from scratch is slow:\nThis screenshot is our job system informing us that the Elasticsearch indexing job has been running for around 18 hours, and hasn\u2019t even finished half of what it needs to do \ud83d\ude41 And the progress was not linear, slowing down more and more the further it progressed! Something was clearly wrong here.\nThe culprit\nLet\u2019s start the investigation by identifying what exactly is slow here, since there are many moving parts: it could be the database, the Mattermost server, the Elasticsearch server, the network, or an under-resourced machine.\nLooking at our Mattermost Performance Monitoring Grafana dashboard while the indexing job was running, the problem was crystal clear at first sight:\nThe graph above shows the top 10 database calls by duration, which comes down (simplifying it a bit) to the following Prometheus query:\ntopk(10,\nsum(increase(mattermost_db_store_time_sum[5m])) by (method)\n/\nsum(increase(mattermost_db_store_time_count[5m])) by (method)\n)\nWe measure the time it takes for each database method to finish, averaged over the last 5 minutes, and we plot that by second, showing only the top 10 methods.\nAnd looking at the graph, there\u2019s a clear outlier there: PostStore.GetPostsBatchForIndexing\n, which is taking more and more time as the indexing job progresses, eventually hitting the 30 seconds mark, when it simply times out. Looking at the code, we see the exact query that\u2019s causing all these problems:\nSELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId\nFROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id\nWHERE\nPosts.CreateAt > ?1\nOR\n(Posts.CreateAt = ?1 AND Posts.Id > ?2)\nORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC\nLIMIT ?3;\nThis query does a simple job: it orders all posts by their creation timestamp and returns the first N (a limit provided by the caller) posts that are newer than a provided timestamp. The query needs to check the ID of the post and cover the rare case of two posts happening simultaneously. It also joins with the Channels table, but only to return the post\u2019s TeamId along with its other data.\nThe indexing job is then built on top of this query, running it over and over again until all posts are indexed. In pseudo-code, it looks something like this:\nfunc IndexingJob() {\nt := 0\nid := \"\"\nlimit := 1000\nfor {\n// Run the query\nbatch := GetPostsBatchForIndexing(t, id, limit)\n// Index the posts returned by the query\nelasticsearchService.Index(batch)\n// Stop when we get less than `limit` posts\nif len(batch) < limit {\nbreak\n}\n// Update the timestamp and id to newest post's\nnewestPost := batch[len(batch)-1]\nt = newestPost.CreateAt\nid = newestPost.Id\n}\n}\nThe first investigation\nNow that we understand what we\u2019re dealing with and what piece of the whole system is misbehaving, we can start the real investigation.\nTrying to optimize a SQL query never follows a predefined plan, but one can apply some methodologies that can help find the problem and possibly the solution faster and more consistently. I didn\u2019t do any of that, though, and my investigation was chaotic and instinct-driven at first. Never do this at home.\nMy first concern with this query was: why on earth does it take longer and longer each time it gets executed? The answer was actually pretty simple, but I had no idea at the beginning. So the first thing I looked at was the data I already had at hand: the AWS Performance insights of the query:\nThis gave me the first clue: the query spends nearly 100% of its running time on CPU. This means the query is not bottlenecked by the time it takes to read or write data, but by the time it takes to process that data. Interesting.\nThen I started playing with the query. The first thing I did was, of course, run an EXPLAIN ANALYZE\n. Lately, I\u2019ve gotten into the habit of adding the BUFFERS\noption to this, so the EXPLAIN\ngives a bit more data. There\u2019s a fantastic blog post on the BUFFERS\noption, so I won\u2019t go into much detail here, but by copying the definition from pgMustard, which is short and to the point, we can understand what this does:\nBUFFERS extends EXPLAIN by adding values to describe the data read/written by each operation.\nWe\u2019re not only getting info on the query plan, but also on the actual data we move around. Neat.\nNow, choosing some data for the arguments the query receives (the timestamp, the post ID and the limit), I ran EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)\nand got the following result:\nmmdb=> EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId FROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id WHERE Posts.CreateAt > '1687424888405' OR (Posts.CreateAt = '1687424888405' AND Posts.Id > 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h') ORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC LIMIT 10000;\nQUERY PLAN\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLimit (cost=1.22..2287.94 rows=10000 width=464) (actual time=23921.236..23954.229 rows=10000 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=40557115\n-> Incremental Sort (cost=1.22..13998881.93 rows=61217938 width=464) (actual time=23921.235..23953.205 rows=10000 loops=1)\nSort Key: posts.createat, posts.id\nPresorted Key: posts.createat\nFull-sort Groups: 311 Sort Method: quicksort Average Memory: 45kB Peak Memory: 45kB\nBuffers: shared hit=40557115\n-> Nested Loop Left Join (cost=1.00..11421751.31 rows=61217938 width=464) (actual time=23920.970..23947.067 rows=10001 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=40557115\n-> Index Scan using idx_posts_create_at on posts (cost=0.57..9889434.54 rows=61217938 width=461) (actual time=23920.930..23931.063 rows=10001 loops=1)\nFilter: ((createat > '1687424888405'::bigint) OR ((createat = '1687424888405'::bigint) AND ((id)::text > 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h'::text)))\nRows Removed by Filter: 40920000\nBuffers: shared hit=40553119\n-> Memoize (cost=0.43..0.70 rows=1 width=30) (actual time=0.001..0.001 rows=1 loops=10001)\nCache Key: posts.channelid\nCache Mode: logical\nHits: 9002 Misses: 999 Evictions: 0 Overflows: 0 Memory Usage: 151kB\nBuffers: shared hit=3996\n-> Index Scan using channels_pkey on channels (cost=0.42..0.69 rows=1 width=30) (actual time=0.007..0.007 rows=1 loops=999)\nIndex Cond: ((id)::text = (posts.channelid)::text)\nBuffers: shared hit=3996\nPlanning:\nBuffers: shared hit=112\nPlanning Time: 0.501 ms\nExecution Time: 23954.974 ms\n(25 rows)\nThat\u2019s\u2026 a lot to digest. Some key points:\nThe second-to-last line, the execution time, says this query took around 24 seconds to finish. This is what we want to fix.\n-\nThe query plan shows the nodes. From inner to outer:\nFirst, a couple of Index scan nodes:\nOne on the Posts table, with a Filter applying the WHERE condition, using an index covering the CreateAt field. Why is it not using the other index this table has on (CreateAt, Id), though? We don\u2019t know yet.\n-\nAnother on the Channels table, with an Index Cond applying the join condition (the post\u2019s ID equals the channel\u2019s ID), using the the index on the primary key, which is the ID.\n-\n-\nThen, it performs the JOIN itself between the Posts and Channels table.\n-\nFinally, it does an Incremental Sort, using Posts.CreateAt and Posts.Id as the sort keys, noting that we have an already sorted key, Posts.CreateAt, due to the fact that we used the idx_posts_create_at index before.\n-\n-\nFirst, a couple of Index scan nodes:\n-\nThe number of shared hit buffers is forty million on the Index Scan node for the Posts table and on the wrapping Nested Loop Left Join node. That\u2019s a lot.\n-\nPoint 3 here is important. Although the number of hits inside a nested loop has its nuances, it\u2019s something that gives us another clue: here\u2019s where the CPU is being spent. Even if this doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re reading 40 million blocks from the cache (we would need a pretty large cache for that), it means we are processing 40 million blocks. We can check how much data this means, actually:\nmmdb=> SELECT pg_size_pretty(40557115 * current_setting('block_size')::bigint);\npg_size_pretty\n----------------\n309 GB\n(1 row)\nSo that query is processing three hundred gigabytes. Not bad.\nThe first solution\nThe first thing I tried to solve this was to remove the JOIN\nwith the Channels\ntable. Both tables are pretty large, so I was worried this was adding a lot of overhead to the query. That ended up not being the case. The time taken on the query without the JOIN\nwas virtually the same as with it.\nWhat next, then? The next step was mostly luck. I wanted to keep understanding the query, so I kept simplifying it.

Before I could keep looking at this plan, I immediately tried to run a query with only the second part of the OR\ncondition; i.e.:\nSELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId\nFROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id\nWHERE Posts.CreateAt = ?1 AND Posts.Id > ?2 -- <- only the second condition here\nORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC\nLIMIT ?3;\nWithout thinking too much about it, I honestly expected this to take around 24 seconds again, so that I could focus on optimizing only this part. But here\u2019s what I got:\nagnivaltdb=> EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId FROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id WHERE Posts.CreateAt = '1687424888405' AND Posts.Id > 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h' ORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC LIMIT 10000;\nQUERY PLAN\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLimit (cost=0.99..17.03 rows=1 width=464) (actual time=0.015..0.015 rows=0 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=4\n-> Nested Loop Left Join (cost=0.99..17.03 rows=1 width=464) (actual time=0.014..0.014 rows=0 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=4\n-> Index Scan using idx_posts_create_at_id on posts (cost=0.57..8.59 rows=1 width=461) (actual time=0.013..0.013 rows=0 loops=1)\nIndex Cond: ((createat = '1687424888405'::bigint) AND ((id)::text > 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h'::text))\nBuffers: shared hit=4\n-> Index Scan using channels_pkey on channels (cost=0.42..8.44 rows=1 width=30) (never executed)\nIndex Cond: ((id)::text = (posts.channelid)::text)\nPlanning:\nBuffers: shared hit=112\nPlanning Time: 0.437 ms\nExecution Time: 0.047 ms\n(13 rows)\nIt took 0.047 milliseconds!!!! That\u2019s\u2026 well, ~500000 (five hundred thousand) times quicker than the original query. What????\nAh, wait, it returned no rows, that makes sense. And it didn\u2019t return rows because it covers a quite rare case, since we\u2019re looking for a post happening in the same millisecond as another one and whose ID is larger than the given one. Not impossible, but not frequent either.\nBut the important question was: where did my original 24 seconds go? Why are these two separate queries taking 30 milliseconds in total instead of 30 seconds?\nI still had too many questions and not enough answers, but I made a decision: I\u2019ll split the original query into those two, run them one after the other, and collect the results in the Mattermost server code afterwards. It will make the code a bit more complex, but it\u2019ll be worth it. I\u2019ll do that tomorrow morning, I said to myself.\nActually understanding everything\nI didn\u2019t do that the next morning either, of course, and I instead went back to understand what was happening. Why were we getting so many shared hit buffers in the original query? Why was it taking longer each time it got executed? Why did the split queries return the exact same answer but 1000 times faster?\nWell, I already had all data I needed to understand everything; it\u2019s just that I hadn\u2019t paid the attention it deserved.\nLooking back at the query plans of the original query and the one filtering only by CreateAt > ...\n, we see a very important difference. Let\u2019s look a bit closer to the Index Scan\nnode in both cases.\nFirst, the original query:\n-> Index Scan using idx_posts_create_at on posts (cost=0.57..9889434.54 rows=61217938 width=461) (actual time=23920.930..23931.063 rows=10001 loops=1)\nFilter: ((createat > '1687424888405'::bigint) OR ((createat = '1687424888405'::bigint) AND ((id)::text > 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h'::text)))\nRows Removed by Filter: 40920000\nBuffers: shared hit=40553119\nNow, the one filtering only by CreateAt > ...\n:\n-> Index Scan using idx_posts_create_at on posts (cost=0.57..5781440.25 rows=61217938 width=461) (actual time=0.032..9.802 rows=10001 loops=1)\nIndex Cond: (createat > '1687424888405'::bigint)\nBuffers: shared hit=9953\nDid you spot the difference? The first one uses a Filter\n, removing 40 million rows in the process, while the second one uses an Index Cond\n, just checking the index itself.\nAnd that\u2019s the main difference. Going back to the short and to-the-point descriptions of pgMustard:\nIndex Cond is the condition used to find the locations of rows from the index. Postgres uses the structured nature of the index to quickly jump to the rows it\u2019s looking for.\nAlthough similar in purpose to \u201cFilter\u201d, the implementation is completely different. In a \u201cFilter\u201d, rows are retrieved and then discarded based on their values. As such, you can find an \u201cIndex Cond\u201d and a \u201cFilter\u201d on the same operation.\nSo that\u2019s the key difference: the original query is going through all the rows in the Posts\ntable, then discarding or keeping them based on the condition, while the second one just looks at the index and retrieves the rows it needs. One question answered!\nBut this also explains why the query takes longer and longer each time it gets executed: as it orders the posts from oldest to newest, and each query uses the newest timestamp of the last batch, it needs to discard more and more rows each time. To see this more clearly, let\u2019s say our Posts table has 1000 posts, and we index batches of 100 posts each time. Then the job runs as follows:\nThe first batch will return posts 0 to 99, discarding no posts at all, so it will be quite fast. In total, it has processed 100 posts, as one could expect.\n-\nThe second batch will return posts 100 to 199, but only after having discarded the first 100 posts. Those first 100 posts were read, though, so in total, it has processed 200 posts.\n-\nThe third batch will return posts 200 to 299, discarding the first 200 posts. That\u2019s 300 posts processed in total.\n-\n\u2026\n-\n\u2026\n-\n\u2026\n-\nThe tenth and last batch will return posts 900 to 999, discarding the first 900 posts. This last batch processed 1000 posts, that is, the whole table.\n-\nMy other two questions have been answered as well: the original query had so many shared hit buffers and was taking longer and longer simply because it was eventually going through the one hundred million posts in our database. Poor query.\nThe beautiful solution\nAlthough it\u2019s true that we now understand everything, we are still left with the original task: split the original query in two, run them independently, and collect the results afterwards in the server.\nBut there\u2019s an alternative, though! Now that I understand everything, I was able to look for similar cases with the exact incantation needed to summon the gods of StackOverflow. And they delivered. Thank you, StackOverflow. And thank you, Laurenz Albe.\nIt turns out there\u2019s a handy feature in PostgreSQL called row constructor comparisons that allows me to compare tuples of columns. That\u2019s exactly what we need. Instead of doing CreateAt > ?1 OR (CreateAt = ?1 AND Id > ?2)\n, we can do (CreateAt, Id) > (?1, ?2)\n. And the row constructor comparisons are lexicographical, meaning that it\u2019s semantically the same as what we had before!\nSo we just need to convert our original query to the following:\nSELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId\nFROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id\nWHERE (Posts.CreateAt, Posts.Id) > (?1, ?2) -- <- lexicographical comparisons to the rescue!\nORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC\nLIMIT ?3;\nAnd what\u2019s the result? Well, let\u2019s see:\nmmdb=> EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId FROM Posts LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id WHERE (Posts.CreateAt, Posts.Id) > ('1687424888405', 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h') ORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC LIMIT 10000;\nQUERY PLAN\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLimit (cost=1.15..1666.83 rows=10000 width=464) (actual time=0.366..34.053 rows=10000 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=13951\n-> Incremental Sort (cost=1.15..10196977.36 rows=61217938 width=464) (actual time=0.365..33.031 rows=10000 loops=1)\nSort Key: posts.createat, posts.id\nPresorted Key: posts.createat\nFull-sort Groups: 311 Sort Method: quicksort Average Memory: 45kB Peak Memory: 45kB\nBuffers: shared hit=13951\n-> Nested Loop Left Join (cost=1.00..7619846.74 rows=61217938 width=464) (actual time=0.059..26.840 rows=10001 loops=1)\nBuffers: shared hit=13951\n-> Index Scan using idx_posts_create_at on posts (cost=0.57..6087529.97 rows=61217938 width=461) (actual time=0.040..10.548 rows=10001 loops=1)\nIndex Cond: (createat >= '1687424888405'::bigint)\nFilter: (ROW(createat, (id)::text) > ROW('1687424888405'::bigint, 'tpomh9yu1tffmdp6dopobwuc9h'::text))\nRows Removed by Filter: 2\nBuffers: shared hit=9955\n-> Memoize (cost=0.43..0.70 rows=1 width=30) (actual time=0.001..0.001 rows=1 loops=10001)\nCache Key: posts.channelid\nCache Mode: logical\nHits: 9002 Misses: 999 Evictions: 0 Overflows: 0 Memory Usage: 151kB\nBuffers: shared hit=3996\n-> Index Scan using channels_pkey on channels (cost=0.42..0.69 rows=1 width=30) (actual time=0.007..0.007 rows=1 loops=999)\nIndex Cond: ((id)::text = (posts.channelid)::text)\nBuffers: shared hit=3996\nPlanning:\nBuffers: shared hit=112\nPlanning Time: 0.471 ms\nExecution Time: 34.716 ms\n(26 rows)\n34 milliseconds, yay! A query that\u2019s 1000 times faster, and that\u2019s even more readable than the original one, a textbook win-win.\nIf you take a look at the Index Scan\nnode, you\u2019ll notice that PostgreSQL is now using an Index Cond\n, thus checking the index to find those posts, and only afterwards applying a Filter. The shared hit buffers went down to 9955, which is only 78 MiB. Isn\u2019t it beautiful?\n(Why the query planner doesn\u2019t automatically convert a condition like x > a OR (x == a AND y > b)\nto (x, y) > (a, b)\nis something I still don\u2019t understand to this day, though.)\nThe solution we need\nSo I was done. But then I remembered that we not only support PostgreSQL, but also MySQL. And that made me shiver.\nOf course, the behaviour in MySQL was the complete opposite \ud83d\ude41\nLet\u2019s run an EXPLAIN ANALYZE\n(no BUFFERS\nin MySQL, sorry) on the query running in MySQL. First, the original one:\nmysql> EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT Posts.*, Channels.TeamId FROM Posts USE INDEX(idx_posts_create_at_id) LEFT JOIN Channels ON Posts.ChannelId = Channels.Id WHERE Posts.CreateAt > 1557752415221 OR (Posts.CreateAt = 1557752415221 AND Posts.Id > 'ad59ire57tfwmjr5r8xqxc75qw') ORDER BY Posts.CreateAt ASC, Posts.Id ASC LIMIT 10000;\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| -> Limit: 10000 row(s) (cost=7472068.91 rows=10000) (actual time=0.063..164.174 rows=10000 loops=1)\n-> Nested loop left join (cost=7472068.91 rows=5559093) (actual time=0.062..163.450 rows=10000 loops=1)\n-> Index range scan on Posts using idx_posts_create_at_id over (CreateAt = 1557752415221 AND 'ad59ire57tfwmjr5r8xqxc75qw' < Id) OR (1557752415221 < CreateAt), with index condition: ((Posts.CreateAt > 1557752415221) or ((Posts.CreateAt = 1557752415221) and (Posts.Id > 'ad59ire57tfwmjr5r8xqxc75qw'))) (cost=1357066.29 rows=5559093) (actual time=0.043..97.358 rows=10000 loops=1)\n-> Single-row index lookup on Channels using PRIMARY (Id=Posts.ChannelId) (cost=1.00 rows=1) (actual time=0.006..0.006 rows=1 loops=10000)\n|\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n1 row in set (0.18 sec)\n0.18 seconds.

Uuuugh.\nThis outcome had no easy escape: I had to split the code flow in two, using the good-looking query when using PostgreSQL, and the original one when using MySQL. And that\u2019s the change that finally got merged. A bit sad, but it is what it is.\nWhat we learned\nThis was a fun journey after all, and definitely a good optimization: who doesn\u2019t love making something a thousand times faster? It ended up landing on v9.7.0 and later, and got backported to the 9.5 ESR as well, starting in v9.5.3.\nAlso, I learned a couple of very interesting things:\nAlways use BUFFERS\nwhen running anEXPLAIN\n. It gives some data that may be crucial for the investigation.\n-\nAlways, always try to get an Index Cond\n(calledIndex range scan\nin MySQL) instead of aFilter\n.\n-\nAlways, always, always assume PostgreSQL and MySQL will behave differently. Because they do.\n-", "hash": "982fdca696b67125c46d2445f2686794add2f30966aa0cf74a79db0752456127", "id": "ad917479-71ab-4bcc-958c-05cff1db1ff3", "link": "https://mattermost.com/blog/making-a-postgres-query-1000-times-faster/", "osint_source_id": "2d88a2c2-3767-419d-ae64-6975e45577be", "published": "2024-05-14T15:00:00", "source": "https://mattermost.com/feed/", "story_id": "2728090a-b819-48c0-b642-5a03c538a3e3", "title": "Making a Postgres query 1000 times faster"}], "tags": {"Elasticsearch": {"name": "Elasticsearch", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Mattermost": {"name": "Mattermost", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "MySQL": {"name": "MySQL", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "PostgreSQL": {"name": "PostgreSQL", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Postgres": {"name": "Postgres", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Uuuugh": {"name": "Uuuugh", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Making a Postgres query 1000 times faster"}, {"attributes": [], "created": "2024-05-14T14:57:38", "id": "0cc77027-e121-4b47-ab9f-40d4b42e06dd", "news_items": [{"author": "Jessie_Hwang", "content": "Join our next community call on May 28 to deep dive into the Copilot for Microsoft 365 Success Kit.

In particular, we find the strongest negative effects at the top of the respective distributions, implying a more pronounced exodus of relatively senior personnel.\nThe study looked at r\u00e9sum\u00e9 data from People Data Labs and used \"260 million r\u00e9sum\u00e9s matched to company data.\" It only examined three companies, but the report's authors noted that Apple, Microsoft, and SpaceX represent 30 percent of the tech industry's revenue and over 2 percent of the technology industry's workforce. The three companies have also been influential in setting RTO standards beyond their own companies. Robert Ployhart, a professor of business administration and management at the University of South Carolina and scholar at the Academy of Management, told the Post that despite the study being limited to three companies, its conclusions are a broader reflection of the effects of RTO policies in the US.\n\"Taken together, our findings imply that return to office mandates can imply significant human capital costs in terms of output, productivity, innovation, and competitiveness for the companies that implement them,\" the report reads.\nFor example, after Apple enacted its RTO mandate, which lets employees work at home part-time, the portion of its employee base considered senior-level decreased by 5 percentage points, according to the paper. Microsoft, which also enacted a hybrid RTO approach, saw a decline of 5 percentage points. SpaceX's RTO mandate, meanwhile, requires workers to be in an office full time. Its share of senior-level employees fell 15 percentage points after the mandate, the study found.\n\"We find experienced employees impacted by these policies at major tech companies seek work elsewhere, taking some of the most valuable human capital investments and tools of productivity with them,\u201d one of the report's authors, Austin Wright, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of Chicago, told the Post.\nChristopher Myers, associate professor of management and organization health at Johns Hopkins University, suggested to the Post that the departure of senior-level workers could be tied to the hurt morale that comes from RTO mandates, noting that \"it\u2019s easier to manage a team that\u2019s happy.\u201d\nDebated topic\nSince the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, whether having employees return to work in an office is necessary or beneficial to companies is up for debate. An estimated 75 percent of tech companies in the US are considered \"fully flexible,\" per a 2023 report from Scoop. As noted by the Post, however, the US's biggest metro areas have, on average, 51 percent office occupancy, per data from managed security services firm Kastle Systems, which says it analyzes \"keycard, fob and KastlePresence app access data across 2,600 buildings and 41,000 businesses.\"\nMicrosoft declined to comment on the report from University of Chicago and University of Michigan researchers, while SpaceX didn't respond. Apple representative Josh Rosenstock told The Washington Post that the report drew \"inaccurate conclusions\" and \u201cdoes not reflect the realities of our business.\" He claimed that \"attrition is at historically low levels.\"\nYet some companies have struggled to make employees who have spent months successfully doing their jobs at home eager to return to the office. Dell, Amazon, Google, Meta, and JPMorgan Chase have tracked employee badge swipes to ensure employees are coming into the office as often as expected. Dell also started tracking VPN usage this week and has told workers who work remotely full time that they can't get a promotion.\nSome company leaders are adamant that remote work can disrupt a company's ability to innovate. However, there's research suggesting that RTO mandates aren't beneficial to companies. A survey of 18,000 Americans released in March pointed to flexible work schedules helping mental health. And an analysis of 457 S&P 500 companies in February found RTO policies hurt employee morale and don't increase company value.\nreader comments\n177", "hash": "6f2ac9e0c0e1ac2c0e052d3e54c7551b517e01dcc956604cedc450fd33cf1744", "id": "10d95fa4-611d-4c09-8c2a-cb9b8ea5f2fd", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024094", "osint_source_id": "a71fce67-918e-4ec0-bd23-e575b5149c1b", "published": "2024-05-14T14:40:32", "source": "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/technology-lab", "story_id": "bb1b8e34-8ecb-470b-8fdf-96f6705ba7dd", "title": "Apple, SpaceX, Microsoft return-to-office mandates drove senior talent away"}], "tags": {"Americans": {"name": "Americans", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Apple": {"name": "Apple", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Austin Wright": {"name": "Austin Wright", "tag_type": "PER"}, "COVID-19": {"name": "COVID-19", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Christopher Myers": {"name": "Christopher Myers", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Dell": {"name": "Dell", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Google": {"name": "Google", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Josh Rosenstock": {"name": "Josh Rosenstock", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Kastle Systems": {"name": "Kastle Systems", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Meta": {"name": "Meta", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Post": {"name": "Post", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "RTO": {"name": "RTO", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Robert Ployhart": {"name": "Robert Ployhart", "tag_type": "PER"}, "SpaceX": {"name": "SpaceX", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "The Washington Post": {"name": "The Washington Post", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "University of Chicago": {"name": "University of Chicago", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "University of Michigan": {"name": "University of Michigan", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "VPN": {"name": "VPN", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Apple, SpaceX, Microsoft return-to-office mandates drove senior talent away"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T17:23:36.440983", "id": "6566a940-11ba-47db-93ee-615899c946dd", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "14"}, {"created": "2024-05-14T17:14:51.226071", "id": "b386323e-5575-47fe-b5cc-cfd92deef7a0", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "4"}], "created": "2024-05-14T14:40:00", "id": "d9f53f7d-00ce-46b4-ab54-263af89dcd66", "news_items": [{"author": "msmash", "content": "Tornado Cash Developer Found Guilty of Laundering $1.2 Billion of Crypto (wired.com) 36\nA panel of judges in the Netherlands has found Alexey Pertsev, one of the developers behind crypto anonymizing tool Tornado Cash, guilty of money laundering. Wired: Over the course of two days in March, the Russian national was tried on the allegation that the tool he developed had allowed criminals -- among them hackers with ties to North Korea -- to freely launder $1.2 billion in stolen cryptocurrency. \"The management of Tornado Cash welcomed the bank robbers with open arms,\" the prosecutors wrote in a March court filing.\nDutch judges sentenced Pertsev to five years and four months in prison on Tuesday, which was the term requested by prosecutors in the case. \"With Tornado Cash, the defendant created a shortcut for financing crimes and terrorism,\" said the court in a statement, translated from Dutch. \"He chose to look away from the abuse and did not take any responsibility.\" The purpose of tools like Tornado Cash, known as crypto mixers or tumblers, is to mask the origin and destination of users' coins.

These services are promoted as a way to improve the level of privacy available to crypto users, but have been readily co-opted for the purpose of money laundering.\nOn August 8, 2022, Tornado Cash was sanctioned in the United States, making it illegal for US citizens to use the service. Any product that \"indiscriminately facilitates anonymous transactions,\" wrote the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, represents a \"threat to US national security.\" Two days later, Pertsev was arrested in the Netherlands, where he resided. Money laundering activity, the Dutch prosecutors claim, accounted for more than 30 percent of the funds that passed through Tornado Cash between 2019 and 2022.

The article suggests the possibility that Signal and US intelligence are closely linked, mentioning that the current chair of the Signal Foundation is Katherine Maher, who from 2010 to 2011 worked for the National Democratic Institute, a US-backed NGO.\nThe report says that Maher was an \"agent of regime change\" during the Arab Spring, and communicated with dissidents in the Middle East and North Africa. Maher has held other noteworthy positions, including serving as CCO at Wikimedia in 2014 to 2016 and then CEO from 2016 to 2021; held a seat in the Foreign Affairs Policy Board from 2022 to last January; and occupied dual roles as CEO and President of National Public Radio (NPR) just last March.\nDurov appears to have used the City Journal article as a jumping off point for his criticisms. \"The US government spent $3 million to build Signal's encryption, and today the exact same encryption is implemented in WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Google Messages and even Skype,\" the Telegram leader said. \"It looks almost as if big tech in the US is not allowed to build its own encryption protocols that would be independent of government interference.\"\nThe CEO also claims that users' Signal messages have popped up in court cases or in the media, and implies that this has happened because the app's encryption isn't completely secure. However, Durov cites \"important people I've spoken to\" and doesn't mention any specific instance of this happening.\nIt's hard to say, but Durov may be making a reference to Sam Bankman-Fried, whose Signal messages were a key part of the trial that resulted in the ex-CEO being convicted. However, it's more likely that the messages' recipients, who included two star witnesses, gave them to federal prosecutors.\nThe Register could not find public reports of Signal messages leaking due to faulty encryption. We also have reached out to the company and will update accordingly.\nDurov's also claims that Signal doesn't permit users to reproduce the iOS version of the app, something that would prove that the version of Signal that users download in the App Store is the same one a user can build using the open source code.\nSimilarly, Durov lampooned WhatsApp for not publishing its source code, saying \"all their talk about \"privacy\" is an even more obvious circus trick.\"\nWhile it is true that iOS users can't make a reproducible build of Signal, that's not for a lack of trying. \"For various Apple-specific reasons this is shockingly hard to do on iOS,\" said Johns Hopkins professor Matthew Green on X. \"Mostly because apps are encrypted. (Apple should fix this.)\"\nDRM encryption also complicates build reproduction for Telegram's iOS app, which Green points out is only possible on older iPhones that have been jailbroken, and can only result in a partial verification since some files are still encrypted. By contrast, reproduction is possible on Android, which doesn't encrypt apps like iOS does.\nDurvo's statements come just a couple of months after he raised the possibility of Telegram going public with an initial public offering (IPO), giving him and his company a key financial incentive to criticize rival services, even if the accusations are a little out there.\nAgain, we've reached out for comment from Telegram and Signal, which haven't yet replied.\u00ae", "hash": "537936588d7f28af156a29fba8fb74c8c22d6bbfc2bc86228622cdb1b80ecf20", "id": "b1de349e-31f7-46db-9c58-07df16d97455", "link": "https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2024/05/14/telegram_ceo_calls_out_rival/", "osint_source_id": "a94d3f15-5689-470c-9d1f-670b8c63491d", "published": "2024-05-14T14:30:13", "source": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/headlines.atom", "story_id": "f9a092c2-c121-44a1-9209-fe3d638dfd58", "title": "Telegram CEO calls out rival Signal, claiming it has ties to US government"}], "tags": {"Android": {"name": "Android", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Apple": {"name": "Apple", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Apple-specific": {"name": "Apple-specific", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "CCO": {"name": "CCO", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CEO": {"name": "CEO", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Durov": {"name": "Durov", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Foreign Affairs Policy Board": {"name": "Foreign Affairs Policy Board", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "IPO": {"name": "IPO", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Katherine Maher": {"name": "Katherine Maher", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Maher": {"name": "Maher", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Matthew Green": {"name": "Matthew Green", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Middle East": {"name": "Middle East", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "NGO": {"name": "NGO", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "NPR": {"name": "NPR", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "National Democratic Institute": {"name": "National Democratic Institute", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "National Public Radio": {"name": "National Public Radio", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "North Africa": {"name": "North Africa", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Pavel Durov": {"name": "Pavel Durov", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Sam Bankman-Fried": {"name": "Sam Bankman-Fried", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Signal": {"name": "Signal", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Signal Foundation": {"name": "Signal Foundation", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Skype": {"name": "Skype", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Telegram": {"name": "Telegram", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "US-backed": {"name": "US-backed", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "WhatsApp": {"name": "WhatsApp", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ex-CEO": {"name": "ex-CEO", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Telegram CEO calls out rival Signal, claiming it has ties to US government"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-15T01:08:28.804334", "id": "41fcea44-c22e-4b61-b870-bd0d08d9720f", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "3"}, {"created": "2024-05-15T01:15:48.692294", "id": "9d895671-f413-42b9-8423-8639ba084ef1", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "23"}, {"created": "2024-05-15T01:09:45.901374", "id": "f7620d23-0163-4fea-90a8-acb4d6000073", "key": "IOC_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-14T14:18:05", "id": "2dc0b83f-248a-4416-b08d-3f78ad277aaa", "news_items": [{"author": "Sergiu Gatlan", "content": "Microsoft fixes Windows zero-day exploited in QakBot malware attacks\nMay 14, 2024\n-\n02:18 PM\n-\n0\n-\nMicrosoft has fixed a zero-day vulnerability exploited in attacks to deliver QakBot and other malware payloads on vulnerable Windows systems.\nTracked as CVE-2024-30051, this privilege escalation bug is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow in the DWM (Desktop Window Manager) core library. Following successful exploitation, attackers can gain SYSTEM privileges.\nDesktop Window Manager is a Windows service introduced in Windows Vista that allows the OS to use hardware acceleration when rendering graphical user interface elements such as glass window frames and 3D transition animations.\nKaspersky security researchers discovered the vulnerability while investigating another Windows DWM Core Library privilege escalation bug tracked as CVE-2023-36033 and also exploited as a zero-day in attacks.\nWhile combing through data related to recent exploits and associated attacks, they stumbled upon an intriguing file uploaded to VirusTotal on April 1, 2024. The file's names hinted that it contained details on a Windows vulnerability.\nAs they discovered, the file provided information (in broken English) regarding a Windows Desktop Window Manager (DWM) vulnerability that could be exploited to escalate privileges to SYSTEM, with the outlined exploitation processing perfectly mirroring the one used in CVE-2023-36033 attacks, even though it described a distinct vulnerability.\nDespite the document's subpar quality and some omissions on how the vulnerability could be exploited, Kaspersky confirmed the existence of a new zero-day privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows DWM Core Library. Microsoft assigned the CVE-2024-30051 CVE ID and patched the vulnerability during this month's Patch Tuesday.\n\"After sending our findings to Microsoft, we began to closely monitor our statistics in search of exploits and attacks that exploit this zero-day vulnerability, and in mid-April we discovered an exploit for this zero-day vulnerability,\" Kaspersky said.\n\"We have seen it used together with QakBot and other malware, and believe that multiple threat actors have access to it.\"\nSecurity researchers at Google Threat Analysis Group, DBAPPSecurity WeBin Lab, and Google Mandiant also reported the zero-day to Microsoft, pointing to likely widespread exploitation in malware attacks.\nQakBot (also tracked as Qbot) started as a banking trojan in 2008 and was used to steal banking credentials, website cookies, and credit cards to commit financial fraud. Over time, QakBot evolved into a malware delivery service, partnering with other threat groups to provide initial access to enterprise and home networks for ransomware attacks, espionage, or data theft.\nWhile its infrastructure was dismantled in August 2023 following a multinational law enforcement operation spearheaded by the FBI and known as Operation 'Duck Hunt,' the malware resurfaced in phishing campaigns targeting the hospitality industry in December.\nLaw enforcement linked QakBot to at least 40 ransomware attacks targeting companies, healthcare providers, and government agencies worldwide, which, according to conservative estimates, caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.\nThroughout the years, Qakbot served as an initial infection vector for various ransomware gangs and their affiliates, including Conti, ProLock, Egregor, REvil, RansomExx, MegaCortex, and, most recently, Black Basta.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

But after hours, he hunts for rare chunks of bitcoin. He does it for the thrill. \u201cIt\u2019s like collecting Magic: The Gathering or Pok\u00e9mon cards,\u201d says Restey. \u201cIt\u2019s that excitement of, like, what if I catch something rare?\u201d\nIn the same way a dollar is made up of 100 cents, one bitcoin is composed of 100 million satoshis\u2014or sats, for short. But not all sats are made equal. Those produced in the year bitcoin was created are considered vintage, like a fine wine. Other coveted sats were part of transactions made by bitcoin\u2019s inventor. Some correspond with a particular transaction milestone. These and various other properties make some sats more scarce than others\u2014and therefore more valuable. The very rarest can sell for tens of millions of times their face value; in April, a single sat, normally worth $0.0006, sold for $2.1 million.\nRestey is part of a small, tight-knit band of hunters trying to root out these rare sats, which are scattered across the bitcoin network. They do this by depositing batches of bitcoin with a crypto exchange, then withdrawing the same amount\u2014a little like depositing cash with a bank teller and immediately taking it out again from the ATM outside. The coins they receive in return are not the same they deposited, giving them a fresh stash through which to sift. They rinse and repeat.\nIn April 2023, when Restey started out, he was one of the only people hunting for rare sats\u2014and the process was entirely manual. But now, he uses third-party software to automatically filter through and separate out any precious sats, which he can usually sell for around $80. \u201cI\u2019ve sifted through around 230,000 bitcoin at this point,\u201d he says.\nRestey has unearthed thousands of uncommon sats to date, selling only enough to cover the transaction fees and turn a small profit\u2014and collecting the rest himself. But the window of opportunity is closing. The number of rare sats yet to be discovered is steadily shrinking and, as large organizations cotton on, individual hunters risk getting squeezed out. \u201cFor a lot of people, it doesn\u2019t make [economic] sense anymore,\u201d says Restey. \u201cBut I\u2019m still sat hunting.\u201d\nRarity out of thin air\nBitcoin has been around for 15 years, but rare sats have existed for barely more than 15 months. In January 2023, computer scientist Casey Rodarmor released the Ordinals protocol, which sits as a veneer over the top of the bitcoin network. His aim was to bring a bitcoin equivalent to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the network, whereby ownership of a piece of digital media is represented by a sat. He called them \u201cinscriptions.\u201d\nThere had previously been no way to tell one sat from another. To remedy the problem, Rodarmor coded a method into the Ordinals protocol for differentiating between sats for the first time, by ordering them by number from oldest to newest. Thus, as a side effect of an apparatus designed for something else entirely, rare sats were born.\nBy allowing sats to be sequenced and tracked, Rodarmor had changed a system in which every bitcoin was freely interchangeable into one in which not all units of bitcoin are equal. He had created rarity out of thin air. \u201cIt\u2019s an optional, sort of pretend lens through which to view bitcoin,\u201d says Rodarmor. \u201cIt creates value out of nothing.\u201d\nWhen the Ordinals system was first released, it divided bitcoiners. Inscriptions were a near-instant hit, but some felt they were a bastardization of bitcoin\u2019s true purpose\u2014as a system for peer-to-peer payments\u2014or had a \u201creflexive allergic reaction,\u201d says Rodarmor, to anything that so much as resembled an NFT.

The goal? To gain useful insights into new ways to compromise organizations.\nResearchers from Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 have identified several recent threat campaigns that have gone beyond the typical use of DNS tunneling, which is the process of using outbound DNS traffic to smuggle malicious data from malware exploitation back to attackers' command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. They revealed in a recent blog post that attackers have been abusing DNS traffic to track victims' activities, by delivering malicious domains to victims with their identity information encoded in subdomain payloads.\n\"DNS tunneling techniques can be leveraged by adversaries to perform various actions not normally associated with [it],\" Unit 42's Shu Wang, Ruian Duan, and Daiping Liu wrote in the post. \"Despite the conventional impression that tunneling is used for C2 and VPN purposes, we also find that attackers can use DNS tunneling as a vehicle for victim activity tracking and network scanning.\"\nThe scanning in recent campaigns includes trolling network infrastructure by encoding the IP address and time stamp in the tunneling payloads, with spoofed source IP addresses, according to Unit 42. This allows attackers to discover open resolvers \u2014 or a DNS server that's willing to resolve recursive DNS lookups for anyone on the Internet \u2014 so that they can exploit resolver vulnerabilities to perform DNS attacks, the researchers wrote. This can lead to malicious redirection or denial-of-service attacks.\nHow DNS Tunneling Works\nDNS tunneling is valuable to malicious actors because it provides a covert communications channel, allowing them to bypass conventional network firewalls and thus hide C2 traffic and data exfiltration among legitimate outbound traffic, masking it from traditional detection methods.\nDNS tunneling hides traffic in several ways. For instance, attackers can send traffic over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 53, which is ubiquitous and commonly allowed through firewalls and other network security measures. The client machine does not communicate with the attacker's server directly, adding another layer of obscurity.\nFurther, attackers typically encode data sent during exfiltration and infiltration with their own customized methods, which disguises the data within seemingly legitimate DNS traffic.\nDNS Tunneling for Tracking\nUnit 42 researchers observed two specific attacks in which DNS tunneling was used to track victims' behavior by using subdomains in DNS traffic.\n\"In this application of DNS tunneling, an attacker's malware embeds information on a specific user and that user's actions into a unique subdomain of a DNS query,\" the researchers explained. \"This subdomain is the tunneling payload, and the DNS query for the FQDN uses an attacker-controlled domain.\"\nOne campaign, dubbed \"TRkCdn\" by the researchers, targeted 731 potential victims using 75 IP addresses for nameservers and resolving 658 attacker-controlled domains. Based on researchers' observations, the technique likely was used to track victims' interaction with email content.\nIn another campaign, aptly dubbed SpamTracker, attackers used DNS tunneling in a similar way to TrkCdn to track spam delivery, the researchers said. The campaign \u2014 related to 44 tunneling domains \u2014 employed emails and website links to deliver spam and phishing content with various lures, including fortune-telling services, fake package delivery updates, secondary job offers, and lifetime free items.\nDNS Tunneling for Scanning\nThe third novel use of DNS tunneling observed by Unit 42 came in the form of using the method to periodically scan a victim's network infrastructure for vulnerabilities \u2014 often the first stage of a cyberattack \u2014 and then performing reflection attacks.\nThe researchers observed the so-called SecShow campaign seeking open resolvers, testing resolver delays, exploiting resolver vulnerabilities, and obtaining time-to-live (TTL) information. It contained three domains that used various subdomains to achieve different types of network scanning.\nThe SecShow campaign generally targeted the open resolvers it found and, as a result, victims of it were mainly from \"education, high tech and government fields, where open resolvers are commonly found,\" the researchers noted.\nMitigating Malicious DNS Behavior\nWhen it comes to detecting DNS tunneling, Unit 42 researchers recommended that organizations control the service range of resolvers to accept necessary queries only, and promptly update the version of the resolver software to prevent the exploitation of N-day vulnerabilities.\nOf course, the best way to prevent attackers from leveraging DNS tunneling in novel attacks is to keep threat actors out of environments entirely, notes Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist at security awareness training firm KnowBe4.\n\"The key is to prevent them from gaining that initial foothold access,\" he says. \"Once they are in, they are in. It's already game over.\"\nTo mitigate about 90% of attacks \u2014 whether they use DNS tunneling or otherwise \u2014 organizations must prevent socially engineered phishing and other attacks from being successful, and patch vulnerable software and firmware, Grimes advises.\nAbout the Author(s)\nElizabeth Montalbano is a freelance writer, journalist, and therapeutic writing mentor with more than 25 years of professional experience.

The Apple IIe came out six years later, with a higher level of integration and a raft of new useful features. Apple eventually ended production of the whole Apple II line in 1993, but that wasn\u2019t the end. People like [James Lewis] are still riffing on the platform to this day. Even better, he came to Supercon 2023 to tell us all about his efforts!\n[James]\u2019s talk covers the construction of the Mega IIe, a portable machine of his own design. As the name suggests, the project was based on the Mega II chip, an ASIC for which he had little documentation. He wasn\u2019t about to let a little detail like that stop him, though.\nThe journey of building the Mega IIe wasn\u2019t supposed to be long or arduous; the initial plan was to \u201cjust wire this chip up\u201d as [James] puts it. Things are rarely so simple, but he persevered nonetheless\u2014and learned all about the Apple II architecture along the way.\nSimply Mega\nFor the unfamiliar, the Mega II contained most of Apple IIe, but condensed down to fit on to one single 84-pin ASIC. It first appeared in 1986, and was used in the Apple IIGS. The Mega II chip doesn\u2019t contain a CPU, but does contain a lot of the supporting hardware that makes the Apple IIe what it is. The IOU, MMU, video and keyboard ROMs, and keyboard and mouse controller are all there.\nIn theory, you could wire it up with a CPU, some RAM, and a ROM, and you\u2019d have an Apple II. That sounded about right to [James], but as he would soon find out, the reality is more complicated. Had real documentation been available, he might have learned this sooner, but he was flying blind and stuck at it anyway.\n[James]\u2019s talk starts by dispelling some myths. The first is that the Mega II is a single-chip Apple II. His own build makes it obvious that\u2019s not the case. Beyond that, he also notes that the Apple IIGS didn\u2019t use the Mega II for backwards compatibility. It was instead used as a memory controller and for working with classic Apple II video modes and the expansion slots. He also states that the \u201cGemini\u201d chip from the Macintosh LC Apple II card is not a Mega II, based on significant differences in registers and general design. He wanted to check on a rumor, too, that the chip was never finished, hence why it was just used as a basic controller in the Apple IIGS. To figure that out, he wanted to prove that you could build a functional Apple II using the Mega II chip salvaged from the IIGS.\nEarly work went well. After spinning up a basic board with the Mega II and the necessary hardware, [James] was able to get a text video mode working. It spat out a lot of gibberish, but it was evidence that something was going on. The string \u201cApple ][\u201d even appeared in the output!\nIt wasn\u2019t smooth sailing from there, though. Months of debugging ensued, with a logic analyzer showing the \u201ccomputer\u201d he\u2019d built was making seemingly random jumps all over the place rather than going through a normal boot process. He suspected it was because the chip wasn\u2019t finished, but that wasn\u2019t the case. Eventually, a friend suggested he check if one of the data bus lines was stuck. It turned out a stuck wire fragment on a solder pad was causing all of his problems. With that fixed, he made a huge leap forward. He saw the message appear\u2014\u201dKERNEL OK\u201d. Success!\nHowever, he still wasn\u2019t at a prompt. He was stuck in a test routine, and didn\u2019t have a fully fledged computer. Nonetheless, he knew this meant he was on the right path. If the test routine was behaving appropriately, it suggested the Mega II really did have most of an Apple II living inside it.\nFrom there, the talk goes through the arduous work required to get this thing fully operational. He faced crash after crash as he tried to get a full boot to happen. Once he got that far, he had to try and go from a rat\u2019s nest of wires and breadboards to something that wouldn\u2019t fall apart every time he breathed on it. His final design has some neat features\u2014like the way he built his own motherboard with a connector that let him plug his logic analyzer right in with a single connector.\nBy revision 2, he had the thing built up on a bunch of PCBs with header connectors, and it was even booting from floppy disks. The amount of work it took to get even this far was phenomenal. [James] didn\u2019t just have to whip up a motherboard, he had to do all kinds of work to give the thing a working keyboard interface and the ability to read floppy disks. By this point, he\u2019d realized that the supposed single chip solution that was the Mega II anything but. Beyond RAM, ROM, and a CPU, it also needed another custom ASIC called SlotMaker, and a keyboard controller. This chip is for handling expansion slots, but it also handles one important signal for the keyboard that makes it essential to the computer\u2019s proper functioning. Frustrating stuff indeed. Other work involved producing video output over VGA and creating a working sound board.\nHis third revision involved consolidating his multi-PCB solution into a working computer on a single PCB. A few mistakes cropped up in the board design, but it wasn\u2019t enough to stop [James]. With a little creative bodging, he got the thing operational. He\u2019d managed to build a working computer based around the Mega II ASIC.\nHe may not have been the first to build a Mega II into a working computer; [James] admits that the prototype of the Tiger Learning Computer from Tiger Electronics does serve as an existing example that the Mega II was usable as a fully-fledged machine. But he did manage to do it without any support or documentation from Apple at all. That\u2019s no mean feat.\nWatching the talk, it\u2019s easy to understand why the project took [James] several years to complete. It\u2019s always neat to see someone set themself a difficult goal and follow through to completion. It\u2019s also rad that [James] was able to teach us so much more about the Mega II that we never knew before. That\u2019s worthy of celebration!\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Delivered daily or weekly right to your email inbox.\nThere Is No Cyber Labor Shortage\nThere are plenty of valuable candidates on the market. Hiring managers are simply looking in the wrong places.\nRex Booth, Chief Information Security Officer, SailPoint\nMay 14, 2024\n5 Min Read\nSource: Bryan Sikora via Alamy Stock Photo\nCOMMENTARY\nThe unfortunate truth is, if you're looking for an entry-level position in the cybersecurity field, there aren't many on-ramps. The wide-ranging security certification bodies and training organizations that dominate the industry have convinced many \u2014 maybe even most \u2014 cybersecurity leaders that \"number of certifications\" or \"years of formal training\" are the only metrics by which potential job candidates should be judged. What's more, the emergence of both undergraduate and graduate-level cybersecurity degrees has placed another arbitrary barrier between otherwise qualified individuals and the jobs they want. Don't have the right degree? Too many organizations will tell you not to bother applying.\nUnfortunately, the meaningless requirements and barriers we place in front of candidates are only likely to get more burdensome with time. Want an entry-level security operations center (SOC) position? Please arrive with a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity, Security+ (CISSP preferred) training, and $30,000 worth of SANS courses. Oh, and be prepared to work third shift for a while.\nYes, those credentials have value, but treating them as mandatory artificially raises the barrier to entry for new security professionals. Hiring managers often are hesitant to hire candidates perceived as undercredentialed when they believe there must be a \"perfect\" candidate out there somewhere. But the truth is, a perfect candidate probably isn't interested in a third-shift SOC position \u2014 which means hiring managers need to reevaluate where they look for new employees and which qualifications matter most.\nSolving the Shortage by Broadening the Candidate Pool\nIt isn't just organizations themselves that fall into this trap \u2014 recruiters do, too. As effective as recruiters are at gathering candidates, they usually aren't cybersecurity experts \u2014 which means they aren't always capable of discerning between cybersecurity candidates ready to deliver value and those who are simply good at marketing themselves. Understandably, they look for shorthand ways to help them narrow down candidates: Degrees, certifications, training, and other measurable factors obviously are attractive. They become de facto indicators of value, and their absence is treated as an indicator that a candidate is unqualified \u2014 or at least not a fit for a technical role.\nThe result is self-defeating. By narrowing down candidate pools based on a small number of arbitrary qualifications, organizations and recruiters end up self-selecting candidates who are good at acquiring credentials and taking tests \u2014 neither of which necessarily correlate to long-term success in the cybersecurity field. Prioritizing this small pool of candidates also means overlooking the many, many candidates with analytical potential, technical promise, and professional dedication who may not have gotten the right degree or attended the right training course. By tapping into these candidates, organizations will find that the \"labor shortage\" that has received so much attention isn't such a hard problem to solve, after all.\nSolving the Problem Requires Adopting a New Approach\nOf course, recruiters and hiring managers aren't the ones who suffer when they overlook potentially valuable candidates. Yes, the companies struggling to fill critical positions will continue to feel the impact of the so-called labor shortage, but perhaps even worse is the fact that it cuts off a path to prosperity for countless individuals who fail to meet a list of arbitrary qualifications. Any security organization worth its salt should have a strong training program in place, and entry-level positions should be treated as just that. Candidates with the right traits and skills are qualified \u2014 whatever their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 may say. Helping them make the most of those skills is up to the organization.\nThis is why the White House's cyber workforce workshops \u2014 well-intentioned though they may be \u2014 are misplaced. Fueled by a limited understanding of the true indicators of success for a cybersecurity career and an inability (or unwillingness) to tackle the root cause of the labor shortage, these workshops have only served to exacerbate the problem. The workshops invite schools and certification bodies to brainstorm ways to improve access to education and training \u2014 without stopping to consider that an overreliance on education and training benchmarks is a core part of the issue at hand. Education and training programs are great, but they scale poorly and continuing to treat them as the gold standard only serves to gatekeep opportunities in our industry. The recent announcement from the White House that candidates for IT positions should be evaluated based on skills rather than degrees is a step in the right direction, but it doesn't go far enough to encourage emerging talent.\nWhere, then, can organizations find qualified individuals to fill their SOCs and run their vulnerability management programs? The answer is simple: They can be found in all walks of life, and from virtually every background. They can be found graduating high school, unconvinced by the merits of higher education and ready and eager to join the workforce. They can be found in fields ranging from closely related IT roles to those a bit further afield in biotech, retail, physical security, and other industries. They can be found in virtually every geographic region and in every imaginable demographic combination. Hiring managers simply require the willingness to organize their teams with the space and time to develop emerging talent. Countless other industries already do this \u2014 and (despite what many security professionals like to think) cybersecurity isn't exceptional. There's nothing unique about this industry that prevents it from approaching talent acquisition the same way.\nThe Cybersecurity Labor Shortage Is a Lie\nNone of this is meant to imply that succeeding as a security analyst is easy. It isn't. It takes a strong analytic mind, a willingness to explore and grow, and a level of comfort with new and evolving technology. Perhaps most importantly, it requires a hiring manager willing to invest in a potentially unproven candidate. But the pool of individuals with the characteristics needed to succeed is far larger than many organizations and recruiters often believe \u2014 they just need to look in the right places. The sooner the industry recognizes how artificial many of the most common barriers to entry are, the sooner security organizations can realize that the so-called \"labor shortage\" is a lie \u2014 one that's been told for far too long.\nAbout the Author(s)\nChief Information Security Officer, SailPoint\nRex Booth is the chief information security officer at SailPoint \u2014 an identity security company \u2014 as well as a non-resident expert at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.

VERT is actively working on coverage for these vulnerabilities and expects to ship ASPL-1106 as soon as coverage is completed.\nIn-The-Wild & Disclosed CVEs\nUp first this month, we have a security feature bypass in MSHTML. More specifically, we have an Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) mitigation bypass in Microsoft Office. There is an interesting disconnect in the current Microsoft content that will hopefully be updated soon. At the time of writing, Microsoft indicated that a user would need to download the malicious file and manipulate it, but not open it. However, in the FAQ, they also indicate that successful exploitation relies on the user opening the document. Since Microsoft has reported this as being actively exploited, extra caution should be taken to verify the source of Office documents before opening them. Microsoft has reported this vulnerability as Exploitation Detected.\nA vulnerability in the Windows Desktop Window Manager (DWM) is described by this CVE. Kaspersky, credited with reporting the vulnerability, has released an article about the vulnerability and indicating that they\u2019ve seen it used within QakBot. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would provide the attacker with SYSTEM privileges. Microsoft has reported this vulnerability as Exploitation Detected.\nThe final vulnerability in this section this month is a denial of service impacting Visual Studio 2022. While information on this vulnerability is public, Microsoft has stated that it has a high attack complexity and requires an attacker to repeatedly exploit the issue by sending constant or intermittent data across the network to take advantage of the race. Microsoft has reported this vulnerability as Exploitation Less Likely.\nCVE Breakdown by Tag\nWhile historical Microsoft Security Bulletin groupings are gone, Microsoft vulnerabilities are tagged with an identifier. This list provides a breakdown of the CVEs on a per tag basis.

"content": "Windows 10 KB5037768 update released with new features and 20 fixes\nMay 14, 2024\n-\n01:59 PM\n-\n1\n-\nMicrosoft has released the KB5037768 cumulative update for Windows 10 21H2 and Windows 10 22H2 with twenty changes, including account notifications in the Start Menu and Widgets on the lock screen.\nKB5037768 is a mandatory Windows 10 cumulative update containing Microsoft's May 2024 Patch Tuesday security updates.\nWindows users can install this update by going into Settings, clicking on Windows Update, and manually performing a 'Check for Updates.'\nHowever, as this update is mandatory, it will automatically start installing in Windows once you check for updates. To make this more manageable, you can schedule a time when your computer is restarted to finish the installation.\nAfter installing this update, Windows 10 22H2 will be updated to build 19045.4412, and Windows 10 21H2 will be updated to build 19044.4412.\nWindows 10 users can also manually download and install the KB5037768 update from the Microsoft Update Catalog.\nWhat's new in Windows 10 KB5037768\nFor the most part, the Windows 10 KB5037768 update consists of mostly bug fixes and improvements. However, with this update, Microsoft released two new features and fixed a known issue that breaks VPN connections.\nThis update also includes a total of twenty fixes or changes, with the highlighted ones listed below:\nThis update addresses a known issue that might cause your VPN connection to fail. This occurs after you install the update dated April 9, 2024, or later.\n-\nNew! This update starts the roll out of account-related notifications for Microsoft accounts in Settings > Home. A Microsoft account connects Windows to your Microsoft apps. The account also backs up all your data and helps you to manage your subscriptions. You can also add extra security steps to keep you from being locked out of your account. This feature displays notifications across the Start menu and Settings. You can manage your Settings notifications in Settings > Privacy & security > General.\n-\nNew! This update affects Widgets on the lock screen. They are more reliable and have improved quality. This update also supports more visuals and a more customized experience for you.\n-\nThis update addresses an issue that affects some wireless earbuds. Bluetooth connections are not stable. This occurs on devices that have firmware from April 2023 and later.\n-\nThis update makes some changes to Windows Search. It is now more reliable, and it is easier to find an app after you install it. This update also gives you a personalized app search experience.\n-\nUnfortunately, four known Windows 10 issues persist with this update, including two longtime problems where Copilot causes icons to switch between multiple monitors and Copilot not being supported if your taskbar is located vertically on the left or right of the screen.\nThe other two issues are that Microsoft Connected Cache (MCC) node discovery is broken when using DHCP Option 235 and Windows users are receiving 0x80070520 errors when attempting to change account profile pictures.\nIn addition to the four highlighted fixes listed above, this update contains changes introduced in last month's KB5036979 preview update bulletin.\nComments\nb1k3rdude - 6 hours ago\n\"New!

And it follows allegations of stalkers using these trackers to harass and even kill victims.\nApple, Amazon, and Tile devices have all allegedly been used to facilitate stalking users and violating their privacy with Bluetooth tracking tags.\nApple's Find My network already has a feature that will send an alert to users if there is an unauthorized AirTag moving with them \u2013 implying that someone has planted a tracker somewhere, such as in a bag or hidden in a vehicle. This latest update \u2013 and iOS 17.5 is out this week \u2013 will mean they get a similar alert if any kind of supported Bluetooth tracker is detected \u2013 not just AirTags.\nAndroid users have been able to get similar AirTag-detection, but it presently requires downloading a separate app specifically for AirTags. The collaboration on a universal standard will eliminate that hassle. In other words, Android will also flag up any supported tracker tag without the need for a separate app.\nGoogle's blog post on Monday emphasized the cross-platform cooperation. \"With this new capability, Android users will now get a 'Tracker traveling with you' alert on their device if an unknown Bluetooth tracking device is seen moving with them over time, regardless of the platform the device is paired with.\"\nIf a user gets this alert, it means that a stalker's Bluetooth tracker is following them. According to Apple and Google, users will then be offered assistance in locating the widget (by having the tracker make a noise) and - if possible - disabling them.\nAccording to Apple's announcement, other Bluetooth tag manufacturers \u2013 including Chipolo, eufy, Jio, Motorola and Pebblebee \u2013 have committed that future trackers will support the anti-stalking alert. Samsung and Tile have endorsed the spec, too, but there's no word on when their products will be updated with the privacy feature.\nFor now, Apple and Google say this anti-stalking mechanism works with widgets that are an \"AirTag, Find My accessory, or other industry specification-compatible Bluetooth tracker.\"\n\"Bluetooth trackers like AirTags are great for finding stuff. However, they've always creeped us out with how they can be \u2013 and are \u2013 abused for stalking,\" Mozilla Foundation's Jen Caltrider, program director for its Privacy Not Included project, told The Register.\nThis added protection, she added, is \"long overdue.\"\nTile started selling Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless tracking tags ten years ago. More recently, in 2021, Samsung introduced its Galaxy SmartTag and Apple introduced its AirTag. Shortly after, reports of stalkers abusing these devices to track \u2013 and sometimes physically harm \u2013 their victims began popping up.\n\"The fact that these Big Tech giants are still working on a public industry specification for these Bluetooth trackers that have been around for over three years now says they care more about profit than protecting people \u2013 they'll get around to the safety features as an afterthought,\" Caltrider argued, noting that Mozilla found similar problems with newer car tracking and monitoring technology.\n\"I really wish the smart people at these companies would think through how their technologies could be used to harm the most vulnerable before they launch them,\" Caltrider added.\nThree dozen plaintiffs join Apple AirTag tracking lawsuit in amended complaint\n-\nApple, Google propose anti-stalking spec for Bluetooth tracker tags\n-\nWomen sue Apple claiming AirTags helped their stalkers\n-\nStalking victims sue Tile and Amazon for negligence over tracking tech\n-\nEFF director of cybersecurity Eva Galperin told The Register the move by Apple and Google is \"a very good start.\" But she pointed out that the standard to track the trackers also raises its own privacy concerns \u2013 which Matthew Green, a cryptographer and professor at Johns Hopkins University in the US, and fellow researchers referenced in a September paper last year.\n\"On one hand, yes, you will be able to protect people from being stalked using AirTags,\" Galperin noted. \"It's very good that people will be getting always-on alerts, no matter what kind of phone they have. But if you are creating a tracking system that allows people to be able to know where all AirTags are and who they belong to, that is also a very serious privacy problem.\"\nIn that paper, the academics propose a cryptographic fix, which they say balances user privacy and stalker detection. \"My hope is that Google and Apple will implement [Green et al's] recommendations,\" Galperin added.\n\"All manufacturers of physical trackers need to step up and make sure that their trackers have mitigations that cannot be turned off,\" she continued. \"But it also needs to be done in a careful, thoughtful manner that does not create an entirely new network for tracking people who have trackers that they're using on their phones.\" \u00ae", "hash": "0f8e1dc59a05b82594f80cb9a4a6ee1b31a1cb79d9623522cce840c94ed12ebc", "id": "bb3722ac-eee5-4bf2-90bb-471b96c8dace", "link": "https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2024/05/14/android_apple_devices_anti_stalking/", "osint_source_id": "a94d3f15-5689-470c-9d1f-670b8c63491d", "published": "2024-05-14T13:30:15", "source": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/headlines.atom", "story_id": "296a1375-f65b-4e1c-939d-1fa55bf1c1c4", "title": "Google, Apple gear to raise tracking tag stalker alarm"}], "tags": {"AirTag": {"name": "AirTag", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "AirTag-detection": {"name": "AirTag-detection", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "AirTags": {"name": "AirTags", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Apple": {"name": "Apple", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Bluetooth": {"name": "Bluetooth", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Caltrider": {"name": "Caltrider", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Chipolo": {"name": "Chipolo", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "EFF": {"name": "EFF", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Galperin": {"name": "Galperin", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Google": {"name": "Google", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Green": {"name": "Green", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Jen Caltrider": {"name": "Jen Caltrider", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Jio": {"name": "Jio", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Matthew Green": {"name": "Matthew Green", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Motorola": {"name": "Motorola", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Mozilla": {"name": "Mozilla", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Mozilla Foundation": {"name": "Mozilla Foundation", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Pebblebee": {"name": "Pebblebee", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Samsung": {"name": "Samsung", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Tile": {"name": "Tile", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "Google, Apple gear to raise tracking tag stalker alarm"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T17:15:58.224267", "id": "0443fef8-41f3-4394-b121-71003a8b06e7", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "17"}, {"created": "2024-05-14T17:11:30.480610", "id": "78275691-7992-4f52-8064-f055ef4347b1", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-14T17:15:05.447503", "id": "7a10d140-7ccd-422b-9037-e132a30d1df1", "key": "IOC_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-14T13:29:21", "id": "242ed6eb-bfc7-4f75-b889-0afd10498821", "news_items": [{"author": "Zeljka Zorz", "content": "Apple backports iOS zero-day patch, adds Bluetooth tracker alert\nApple has backported the patch for CVE-2024-23296 to the iOS 16 branch and has fixed a bug (CVE-2024-27852) in MarketplaceKit that may allow maliciously crafted webpages to distribute a script that tracks iOS users on other webpages.\nThe company has also added a new capability to iOS 17 that will alert users if an unknown Bluetooth tracker is \u201cseen\u201d moving with them.\nPatched vulnerabilities\nApple released security updates for iOS and iPadOS, macOS, Safari, tvOS and watchOS on Monday.\nThe update for macOS Sonoma carries fixes for 22 vulnerabilities, the updates for macOS Ventura and Monterey just a handful.\nThe fix for the RTKit zero-day (CVE-2024-23296) \u2013 which has been patched in iOS and iPadOS 17.4, macOS Sonoma, watchOS, tvOS and visionOS in March 2024 after reports of in-the-wild exploitation \u2013 has been backported only to Ventura, iOS 16.7.8 and iPadOS 16.7.8 (for now).\nUsers running the iOS and iPadOS 17 branch can grab the latest update that fixes may different vulnerabilities.

Das stie\u00df auf Kritik, die Bahn sieht den Schritt als Erfolg an.\nSeit Ende vorigen Jahres verlangt die Deutsche Bahn von ihrer Kundschaft, dass sie beim Kauf eines Fahrkarten-Abonnements w\u00e4hrend der Buchung im Internet ihr Bankkonto best\u00e4tigt. Die Zahl der Betrugsversuche sei seitdem zur\u00fcckgegangen, sagte eine Bahn-Sprecherin am Dienstag in einem Pressegespr\u00e4ch. Das sei das Ziel der Verifikation gewesen. Genaue Zahlen nannte sie nicht.\nDie DB arbeitet f\u00fcr diesen Best\u00e4tigungsprozess mit den Finanzdienstleistern Tink und Verimi zusammen. Dabei melden sich die Kundinnen und Kunden im Online-Banking-System ihrer Bank an. \"Abgefragt wird dabei nur der erfolgreiche Login und der Name der kontof\u00fchrenden Person im Online-Banking-System. Die DB erh\u00e4lt nur die Information \u00fcber den erfolgreichen Login\", hatte ein DB-Sprecher im Dezember 2023 heise online erl\u00e4utert.\nEinige potenzielle Kunden schreckt dieses Verfahren ab. Der Hacker und vielgelesene Blogger Felix von Leitner schrieb im April beispielsweise, er werde es boykottieren, er werde seine Konto-Login-Daten niemandem geben. Auf derartige Proteste hinsichtlich Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsaspekten angesprochen, die sich in sozialen Netzwerken oder auch in E-Mails an heise online niederschlugen, sagte die DB-Sprecherin der Bahn, es habe in j\u00fcngster Zeit keine auff\u00e4lligen Buchungsabbr\u00fcche gegeben, die auf Probleme hinweisen w\u00fcrden.\nWeniger Plastik\nZur Digitalisierungsstrategie der Bahn, zu der auch solche Bezahlverfahren geh\u00f6ren, hie\u00df es in dem Pressegespr\u00e4ch, im Fernverkehr buchten mittlerweile 90 Prozent der Kundschaft ihre Fahrten \u00fcber den DB-Navigator oder die Website. Im Nahverkehr, in dem eher Spontank\u00e4ufe am Automaten eine Rolle spielen, sei die Zahl der digitalen K\u00e4ufe seit Einf\u00fchrung des Deutschlandtickets auf 78 Prozent angestiegen.\nEmpfohlener redaktioneller Inhalt\nMit Ihrer Zustimmmung wird hier eine externe Umfrage (Opinary GmbH) geladen.\nIch bin damit einverstanden, dass mir externe Inhalte angezeigt werden. Damit k\u00f6nnen personenbezogene Daten an Drittplattformen (Opinary GmbH) \u00fcbermittelt werden. Mehr dazu in unserer Datenschutzerkl\u00e4rung.\nDie Bahn verteidigte bei dieser Gelegenheit auch ihren Plan, Bahncard 50 und Bahncard 25 k\u00fcnftig nicht mehr physisch anzubieten. 30.000 Tonnen Plastik w\u00fcrden dadurch eingespart. Die Bahncard 100 werde m\u00f6glicherweise noch folgen, sie habe aber als vollst\u00e4ndige Fahrkarte noch einen anderen Stellenwert als die Rabattkarten. Es gebe aber viele W\u00fcnsche aus der Kundschaft nach einer rein digitalen Bahncard 100, sagte eine DB-Sprecherin. Wer es w\u00fcnsche, k\u00f6nne sich seine Bahncard 50 oder 25 immer noch auf Papier ausdrucken.\nMehr Flexibilit\u00e4t\nDurch die Digitalisierung, die sich auch in der neuesten Version der Bahn-App DB Navigator zeige, k\u00f6nne das Unternehmen flexibler seine Angebote gestalten. Die App sei mittlerweile 70 Millionen Mal geladen worden, mit ihr seien 2023 rund 96,5 Millionen Buchungen vorgenommen worden. Auch k\u00f6nnten Kunden mit Ticket ohne Zugbindung ihre Fahrten im Navigator festlegen. Das sei auch vor dem Hintergrund der anstehenden Generalsanierung des Schienennetzes wichtig, um die Kundschaft direkt anzusprechen, wenn sich durch Bauarbeiten der Betriebsablauf \u00e4ndert.\nZu den flexiblen Angeboten, die durch Digitalisierung m\u00f6glich w\u00fcrden, geh\u00f6rt zum Beispiel eine spezielle und rein digitale Probebahncard 25 zur anstehenden Fu\u00dfballeuropameisterschaft der M\u00e4nner. Sie soll ab dem 15. Mai bis zum 16. Juni 2024 erh\u00e4ltlich sein und f\u00fcr die 2. Klasse 19,90 Euro, f\u00fcr die 1. Klasse 39,90 Euro kosten. Falls die deutschen Fu\u00dfballer im Sommer den EM-Titel gewinnen, werde sich die Probe- f\u00fcr ein Jahr kostenlos in eine Dauerbahncard 25 umwandeln. Aber aufgepasst: Wer seine Bahncard 25 nicht rechtzeitig k\u00fcndigt, bekommt sie automatisch verl\u00e4ngert.\n(anw)", "hash": "ef36cdf811be4a42f4edf1d3c18fc04259df19a597355bf50535d6dd959f9b6d", "id": "d0ae319d-97fb-4fdb-9557-b92ad8ae6ddf", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Deutsche-Bahn-Betrugsfaelle-durch-Bankkonto-Bestaetigung-zurueckgegangen-9717682.html?wt_mc=rss.red.security.security.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "c2c6d572-40f6-4271-ade8-596b8f44c6bb", "published": "2024-05-14T13:29:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/security/rss/news-atom.xml", "story_id": "08fbfa3e-ebab-4b62-bd99-8e88bc5f4a7a", "title": "Deutsche Bahn: Betrugsf\u00e4lle durch Bankkonto-Best\u00e4tigung zur\u00fcckgegangen"}], "tags": {"Deutsche Bahn": {"name": "Deutsche Bahn", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Felix von Leitner": {"name": "Felix von Leitner", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Deutsche Bahn: Betrugsf\u00e4lle durch Bankkonto-Best\u00e4tigung zur\u00fcckgegangen"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T17:15:33.010168", "id": "de1ded02-1b82-4ff7-a7a4-3869ecfeac47", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "4"}], "created": "2024-05-14T13:23:08", "id": "fdd3565f-cf72-455b-9c86-f6bea759d6f7", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Dyson bringt ersten Wischsauger, der nicht saugt\nDyson hat einen neuen \"Waschsauger\" f\u00fcr Hartb\u00f6den vorgestellt.

If there is an update available, Chrome will notify you and start downloading it. Then all you have to do is relaunch the browser in order for the update to complete, and for you to be safe from those vulnerabilities.\nTechnical details on the vulnerabilities\nIf you have already updated to version 124.0.6367.201/.202 for Mac and Windows or 124.0.6367.201 for Linux, this will provide protection against the first vulnerability. The patch Google issued four days ago covered this actively exploited vulnerability.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database lists publicly disclosed computer security flaws. The actively exploited CVE patched in this update is:\nCVE-2024-4671 a use after free in Visuals in Google Chrome prior to 124.0.6367.201 allowed a remote attacker who had compromised the renderer process to potentially perform a sandbox escape via a crafted HTML page.\nUse after free (UAF) is a type of vulnerability that is the result of the incorrect use of dynamic memory during a program\u2019s operation. If, after freeing a memory location, a program does not clear the pointer to that memory, an attacker can use the error to manipulate the program. Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code. In this case, by exploiting the vulnerability, the attacker can escape the sandbox that should contain any threats to the browser.\nExploitation is possible by getting the target to open a specific, specially crafted webpage, so the vulnerability is suitable for exploitation as a drive-by attack.\nCVE-2024-4761: An out of bounds write in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 124.0.6367.207 allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory write via a crafted HTML page.\nAn out-of-bounds write or read flaw makes it possible to manipulate parts of the memory which are allocated to more critical functions. This could allow an attacker to write code to a part of the memory where it will be executed with permissions that the program and user should not have.\nV8 is Google\u2019s open-source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine and is part of the Chromium project. Among others it runs the JavaScript code included in webpages.\nAgain, exploitation is possible by getting the target to open a specific, especially crafted webpage, which makes the vulnerability suitable for exploitation as a drive-by attack.\nWe don\u2019t just report on threats\u2014we remove them\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

This improvement makes it easier than ever for developers to manage authentication and certificates for their applications. This blog post will introduce certificate management in Container Apps and the benefits of storing your credentials in Key Vault. For detailed documentation on this feature, check here.\n \nIntro to certificate management\nSecure communication across services requires the constant management of information such as secrets, credentials, certificates, and keys. They have to be maintained with regular updates, renewals, and monitoring. Vulnerabilities like pushing a private connection string to the cloud are easy to create but difficult to detect and fix.\n \nContainer Apps has always provided options for certificate management such as Container App Managed Certificates. The support for Key Vault improves on that because it simplifies tasks like autorotation and follows security best practices by using managed identities to manage certificates.\n \nWhy Key Vault?\nKey Vault\u2019s certificate management service is powerful and comprehensive, allowing for everything from automatic renewal to setting up notifications around lifecycle events. That means that once a developer has integrated Key Vault into their project, they can stop thinking about maintaining the security of their application and focus on writing code.\n \nAccess to Key Vault leverages managed identities, which follows Azure security best practices.\n \nGet started with certificate management\nNow, we will walk through an overview of how to connect to Azure Key Vault using the Azure CLI and Portal. To follow this tutorial, you will need a Key Vault, certificate, and an environment-level managed identity \u2013 all with correct permissions configured. Detailed documentation, including how to set-up necessary resources and permissions, can be found here.\n \nPortal\nNavigate to your Container Apps Environment and open the \u2018Certificates\u2019 blade. Navigate to the \u2018Bring your own certificates (.pfx)\u2019 tab.\n \n\n \nSelect \u2018Add certificate\u2019 and for \u2018Source\u2019, select \u2018Import from Key Vault\u2019. Go through the process of selecting your Key Vault and certificate.\n \n\n \nYou will then be asked for the managed identity you want to use for authentication. You will be able to use either a System assigned or User assigned identity. Click \u2018Add\u2019 and if all permissions are correctly configured for your Key Vault and managed identity, your certificate should be successfully imported.\n \nCLI\nIf you haven't already, download version 0.3.49 or higher of the containerapp extension to the Azure CLI.

He was recruited into the IDF\u2019s elite Unit 8200 for his military service. Now he is CTO and co-founder of cybersecurity firm Sentra.\nReiter\u2019s career is not untypical \u2013 starting in early years by just messing with friends\u2019 computers to be \u2018more interesting\u2019, becoming a hacker in his teens and early twenties, and then going on to co-found a cybersecurity company. The details, however, are less typical. When asked if he was a hacker, he replied, \u201cYes, I am a professional hacker.\u201d\nThis was the first time in this series that a hacker has added the epithet \u2018professional\u2019 to the title. While it may seem insignificant, it is indicative of the man, his persona, and his history \u2013 and a specific type of hacker.\nThe development of a professional hacker\nReiter believes that hacking may originate in curiosity, but the initial curiosity does not necessarily make a hacker. He was interested in computers and computing from an early age, and started coding before he was nine years old \u2013 but he didn\u2019t start hacking until he was a teenager. \u201cCuriosity is the first step to being a hacker, but it\u2019s completely unrelated to being a hacker. I only started to like hacking when I was a teenager.\u201d\nBy this time, he already understood computers and computing. Now, perhaps partially through teenage rebellion, he no longer wished to be considered just the nice guy. He began to mess with his friends, sending them harmless viruses or accessing their CD-ROMs.\n\u201cIt was just to show off and show people what I could do. Imposing your will on your friends\u2019 computers is impressive. It\u2019s a skill that makes you more interesting and more likable at school. I liked that people thought I was smart.\u201d It is worth noting, however, he never thought of hacking as anything more than a bit of fun.\nBut then came the compulsory Israeli military service. He was recruited into the IDF\u2019s Unit 8200. This is officially known as the Central Collection Unit of the Intelligence Corps \u2013 the IDF unit responsible for SIGINT and cyberwarfare. Israel is perhaps unique in the world. It is almost surrounded by groups, some of which are classified as terrorist groups, that openly call for its destruction. Military intelligence and both defensive and offensive cyber capabilities are key to its national defense and security posture.\nReiter\u2019s history as a coding prodigy and his involvement in teenage hacking would have been known to the IDF. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to find hackers online,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the ways that military intelligence looks for people.\u201d His military training transformed him from being a childhood fun-seeker into a professional hacker \u2013 it\u2019s where things got more serious.\n\u201cI got the professional education and guidance necessary. I really learned how things work and I learned the tools and the methodologies and the techniques necessary to manipulate systems. I learned from my friends and colleagues, and my managers; I got tasks and missions, and it really became my profession. But I\u2019ve never used these skills for anything other than protecting my country.\u201d By \u2018these skills\u2019, he includes the dark side of hacking.\nWhen he retired from the IDF, he took his professional hacking skills with him, but changed his motivation from defending his country to defending companies. He didn\u2019t suddenly cease to be a professional hacker. \u201cI\u2019ve done whitehat hacking. Every now and then I\u2019ve helped people better protect their systems\u2014 like ticketing booths for movie theaters, and parking systems. I found a way to get free parking tickets. So, in that sense, I continued it as a hobby. I never did it as a profession,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never used my skills for any type of damage or malicious activity, which isn\u2019t related to protecting my country. Now I have a security company. I use my skill set as a hacker to build a security product. And that\u2019s why today I still consider myself as a professional hacker. I\u2019m the CTO of the Sentra cybersecurity company, and my hacking knowledge helps me understand how to build a better security product.\u201d\nThis is the professional hacker. It is someone who has been formally trained to be a hacker, not someone who is self-taught. That quality of training is most usually found within national military intelligence agencies.\nThe skills necessary to be a whitehat hacker are the same as those necessary to be a blackhat hacker. But when you are in the military and defending your country, you don\u2019t get to choose between offensive (cyberwarfare?) and defensive (SIGINT?) missions. The normal associations of malicious offense with blackhat, and moral defense with whitehat simply do not apply. So, \u2018professional hacker\u2019 is the best description.\nA professional view of the hacker\nWe asked Reiter what it takes to be a hacker. \u201cWhen I say \u2018hacker\u2019,\u201d he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t mean the script kiddie who only runs scripts that may have been developed by real hackers.\u201d Many of the internet\u2019s cybercriminals today are little more than script kiddies, and this number is likely to grow with the increasing professionalism and separation of roles within the criminal underground. But when Reiter describes a hacker, he is really describing the professional hacker that is more likely to be found in the APT groups.\n\u201cThere are two types of hacker,\u201d he says: \u201creverse engineers and system hackers. Reverse engineers will take a piece of software, break it down, understand its workings and try to build exploits that will make it behave differently under certain situations.\u201d\nHe gives an example. \u201cLet\u2019s say I take an email server, or a phone messaging server. I look for a vulnerability so that I can craft a very special email or a very special text message that I send to you over, say, iMessage, that makes your iPhone, or your email server behave in a certain way. It might let me take control over the machine that runs that server, or perhaps install some malware on your iPhone that will let me control the phone and later extract information. That\u2019s one type of hacker.\u201d\nFor this you need to learn reverse engineering and learn how computers work. \u201cThings like assembly language, and a deep understanding of CPU architecture and how it works \u2014 and how compilers work, how code works, how the memory works, and how modern computer protections work.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the first type of hacker. The second is the systems hacker. \u201cSystems hacking is more focused on things like web servers, on understanding how web applications are built, how servers are connected and how organizations are protected by firewalls and the networking stack. You must be able to look at an organization and understand how to attack it. Maybe you need to send an email and control some workstation within the organization\u2019s network that you can take over and then run your own commands, or maybe you look for interesting servers and hack them. That\u2019s a different type of hacking,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cYou need a very, very broad understanding of how web applications are built, and how networks are built, and how security products are built, and just about how every piece of software and hardware in the world of IT works. That\u2019s the two types of hacker. The ultimate hacker is the one who does both. It\u2019s possible \u2014 you can do both. It took a lot of time, but I got there. I may not be level ten in both, but I\u2019m very good.\u201d\nThere is a further requirement for both types of hacker beyond skill and knowledge. \u201cThe other thing a hacker needs is an incredible amount of patience and dedication, because it\u2019s very hard to find and exploit a vulnerability,\u201d he added. \u201cIt can take months to find just one vulnerability, and then you must work really hard to exploit it. It requires a lot of devotion, dedication, patience, skill, and intelligence to be a professional hacker.\u201d\nMorality: black, white, shades of gray, and professional\nMorality plays no part in the process of hacking. But morality does direct the purpose and/or outcome of hacking. In general, we categorize hackers as blackhats, whitehats, or greyhats. This series suggests the possibility of a fourth, which we could just call \u2018shady\u2019. Shady is the childhood fun hacker who messes with friends\u2019 computers, technically illegally but with no malicious intent beyond being the cool kid on the block. Reiter\u2019s CV introduces a further and very important category: the professional hacker.\nBlackhats hack for personal gain, usually financial. \u201cA blackhat is an immoral person,\u201d comments Reiter, \u201cno better than a thief.\u201d Whitehats use their skills to help organizations improve their systems and security defenses. Pentesters and researchers are subcategories of the whitehat. In general, whitehats attempt to stay within the confines of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).\nGreyhats are a little different \u2014 they will break the law, but for moral rather than immoral purposes. Morally-motivated hacktivists could be seen as a subcategory of greyhats. Reiter gives an extreme example: breaking into the Pentagon for the sole purpose of demonstrating that it is insecure. \u201cYou could go to jail for that. But the truth is, you did it for a good reason; you didn\u2019t do it for your own benefit. This is the grey area between being a blackhat and a whitehat.\u201d\nThe blackhat is immoral, the whitehat is moral, and the greyhat is amoral. But the professional hacker stands apart from all these considerations. For the sake of argument, we\u2019ll suggest that professional hackers are the alumni of national military and intelligence agencies. This is where they learn the profession of hacking. Morality and immorality play no part in national security and defense \u2014 but geopolitics does; and this is where the concept of morality gets confused.\nIf professional hackers are the alumni of intelligence agencies, then the most destructive APTs out of Russia, China, and North Korea are better viewed as professional hackers rather than blackhats. North Korea may be an outlier since many North Korean hacks are designed purely for financial gain, which is a key characteristic of the blackhat. Nevertheless, the motivation is national rather than personal.\nIt would be wrong to describe these professional hackers as blackhats \u2013 even when they are attacking critical industries. Their personal motivation is patriotism rather than personal gain. But it is right for security teams to consider them enemies, especially where that patriotism belongs to a geopolitically adversarial nation.\nIn the West, the professional alumni of the intelligence agencies generally become whitehats working to strengthen society\u2019s security defenses (consider From IDF to Inc: The Israeli Cybersecurity Startup Conveyor Belt). Ron Reiter, now co-founder and CTO at Sentra, is one of these. We do not know what happens in adversarial nations, but the suspicion is that many become blackhats of the most dangerous type.\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Chris Wysopal, AKA Weld Pond\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Casey Ellis, Hacker and Ringmaster at Bugcrowd\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Youssef Sammouda, Bug Bounty Hunter\nRelated: Hacker Conversations: Inside the Mind of Daniel Kelley, ex-Blackhat", "hash": "9f645bf56a4c62f411e1dc143a8d278853b490984431e0b4c2c9d4cf633b8389", "id": "fd11c023-e008-4aef-a820-4255b6c8abd8", "link": "https://www.securityweek.com/hacker-conversations-ron-reiter-and-the-making-of-a-professional-hacker/", "osint_source_id": "12f6122e-c3f7-4d6c-813e-db39f757e369", "published": "2024-05-14T13:05:32", "source": "https://feeds.feedburner.com/Securityweek?format=xml", "story_id": "143c446b-ac19-4d93-83e6-2d151b85fdc0", "title": "Hacker Conversations: Ron Reiter, and the Making of a Professional Hacker"}], "tags": {"CTO": {"name": "CTO", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Casey Ellis": {"name": "Casey Ellis", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Central Collection Unit of the Intelligence Corps": {"name": "Central Collection Unit of the Intelligence Corps", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "China": {"name": "China", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Chris Wysopal": {"name": "Chris Wysopal", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Daniel Kelley": {"name": "Daniel Kelley", "tag_type": "PER"}, "IDF": {"name": "IDF", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Israel": {"name": "Israel", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Israeli": {"name": "Israeli", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Morally-motivated": {"name": "Morally-motivated", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "North Korea": {"name": "North Korea", "tag_type": "Country"}, "North Korean": {"name": "North Korean", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Pentagon": {"name": "Pentagon", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Reiter": {"name": "Reiter", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Ron Reiter": {"name": "Ron Reiter", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Russia": {"name": "Russia", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Sentra": {"name": "Sentra", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Shady": {"name": "Shady", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Unit 8200": {"name": "Unit 8200", "tag_type": "APT"}, "Youssef Sammouda": {"name": "Youssef Sammouda", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Hacker Conversations: Ron Reiter, and the Making of a Professional Hacker"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-15T01:16:07.405894", "id": "0c7ebb25-f42c-402e-9ffe-bbc85e33442c", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-14T13:02:20", "id": "eddbce8c-e055-45a8-8e91-f02bb2c9c14d", "news_items": [{"author": "Mike Gannotti", "content": "The Microsoft 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report is a comprehensive study of the changing patterns and preferences of workers across the world.

PDFs have evolved into a standard format for presenting text, images, and multimedia content with consistent layout and formatting, irrespective of the software, hardware, or operating system used to view them.\nIn the realm of PDF viewers, Adobe Acrobat Reader reigns supreme as the industry\u2019s dominant player. However, while Adobe Acrobat Reader holds the biggest market share, notable contenders are vying for attention, with Foxit PDF Reader being a prominent alternative, with more than 700 million users located in more than 200 countries.\nCheck Point Research has identified an unusual pattern of behavior involving PDF exploitation, mainly targeting users of Foxit Reader. This exploit triggers security warnings that could deceive unsuspecting users into executing harmful commands. Check Point Research has observed variants of this exploit being actively utilized in the wild.\nFlaws within the Design\nThe exploitation takes advantage of the flawed design of Warning messages in Foxit Reader which provide as default options that are the most harmful. Once a careless user proceeds twice with the default option, the exploit triggers, downloading and executing a payload from a remote server.\nThis exploit has been used by multiple threat actors, in use on e-crime and espionage. Check Point Research isolated and investigated three in-depth cases, ranging from an espionage campaign to e-crime with multiple links and tools, achieving impressive attack chains.\nOne of the most prominent campaigns leveraging this exploit has been possibly performed by the espionage group known as APT-C-35 / DoNot Team. Based on the specific malware deployed, the commands sent to the Bots, and the obtained victim data, the Threat Actor has the capability of performing hybrid campaigns targeting Windows and Android devices, which also resulted in a Two Factor Authentication (2FA) bypass.\nThis exploit has also been used by various Cyber-crime actors distributing the most prominent malware families such as:\nCheck Point Research followed the links of a campaign possibly distributed via Facebook, which resulted in an impressive attack chain to drop an infostealer and two crypt-miners.\nDuring another campaign, Check Point Research identified the Threat Actor as @silentkillertv performing a campaign utilizing two chained PDF files while one was hosted on a legitimate website, trello.com. The Threat Actor is also selling malicious tools and, on the 27th of April, advertised this exploit.\nWhile researching, Check Point obtained multiple builders that actors possess which create malicious PDF files taking advantage of this exploit. The majority of the collected PDFs were executing a PowerShell command which was downloading a payload from a remote server and then executing, though on some occasions other commands were used.\nWhile this \u201cexploit\u201d doesn\u2019t fit the classical definition of triggering malicious activities, it could be more accurately categorized as a form of \u201cphishing\u201d or manipulation aimed at Foxit PDF Reader users, coaxing them into habitually clicking \u201cOK\u201d without understanding the potential risks involved. Threat Actors vary from E-crime to APT groups, with the underground ecosystem taking advantage of this \u201cexploit\u201d for years, as it had been \u201crolling undetected\u201d as most AV & Sandboxes utilize the major player in PDF Readers, Adobe. The infection success and the low detection rate allows malicious PDFs to be distributed via many untraditional ways, such as Facebook, without being stopped by any detection rules. Check Point Research reported the issue to Foxit Reader, which acknowledged it and stated that it would be resolved in version 2024 3.\nWith the increasing sophistication of social engineering tactics, it is imperative for users to be aware and vigilant and to stay informed, exercise caution, and implement robust security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and security awareness training, to mitigate the risk of falling victim to such attacks.\nCheck Point Threat Emulation, Harmony Endpoint and Harmony Mobile Protect provide comprehensive coverage of attack tactics, file-types, and operating systems and protect its customers against the type of attacks and the \u201cexploit\u201d described in this report.\nWins.FoxitExploit.ta.A\n-", "hash": "23cf8aabfe4c10874a82652e926558fcfd2bf27bf07fc5b88dd859182f0ad6ec", "id": "d253aaff-3623-4d64-b269-f6979011f67a", "link": "https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/foxit-pdf-reader-flawed-design-hidden-dangers-lurking-in-common-tools/", "osint_source_id": "5af32728-cd06-4304-b20a-485ddcde89a2", "published": "2024-05-14T13:00:47", "source": "https://blog.checkpoint.com/feed/", "story_id": "399b24e6-2d77-42ce-b621-89baef1f4c10", "title": "Foxit PDF Reader \u201cFlawed Design\u201d : Hidden Dangers Lurking in Common Tools"}], "tags": {"Adobe": {"name": "Adobe", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Bots": {"name": "Bots", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Check Point Research": {"name": "Check Point Research", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Cyber-crime": {"name": "Cyber-crime", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Donot Team": {"name": "Donot Team", "tag_type": "APT"}, "Foxit PDF Reader": {"name": "Foxit PDF Reader", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Foxit Reader": {"name": "Foxit Reader", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Multi-factor authentication": {"name": "Multi-factor authentication", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "Security awareness training": {"name": "Security awareness training", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "phishing": {"name": "phishing", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Foxit PDF Reader \u201cFlawed Design\u201d : Hidden Dangers Lurking in Common Tools"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T17:14:35.886726", "id": "80a3bf56-20d8-450d-a35a-4feab9968301", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}, {"created": "2024-05-14T17:19:39.590263", "id": "b6a3090d-ca4a-4237-886b-b7f5bb094f2a", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "7"}], "created": "2024-05-14T13:00:00", "id": "bb4abec6-9c38-4a2a-b225-6183b0044d49", "news_items": [{"author": "May", "content": "Trustwave SpiderLabs\u2019 2024 Public Sector Threat Landscape: Trustwave Threat Intelligence Briefing and Mitigation Strategies report details the security issues facing public sector security teams as they try to strike a balance between supplying needed services and deploying the cybersecurity necessary to protect data placed in their charge.\nThe need for the highest level of security has never been greater.

Breaches can disrupt essential services that citizens rely on daily, from healthcare and social security to law enforcement and national defense.\nUnlike an attack on a retailer that might delay shipments, successful public sector attacks can upset the very fabric of society and erode public confidence in government institutions, potentially hindering cooperation and creating a climate of fear and uncertainty.\nThreat actors understand the important role these potential targets play in their society, but they are also aware of the potential rewards. Public agencies harbor large quantities of our personal information, and such data is high on any attacker\u2019s list as it can be used for extortion purposes, sold on the Dark Web, or used for additional attacks.\nFurthermore, successful cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, such as power grids or transportation systems, can have a ripple effect, causing widespread economic disruption, jeopardizing public safety, and even endangering lives.\nCybersecurity Issues Unique to the Public Sector\nLegacy and Diverse Systems: Public sector agencies often rely on outdated legacy systems that were built without modern cybersecurity threats in mind. These systems can be difficult and expensive to patch or upgrade, and many are managed by private entities with very little standardization, making them prime targets for exploitation.\n-\nFocus on Public Service: In pursuit of public service, government agencies may prioritize accessibility and user convenience over stringent security measures. This pursuit can leave them vulnerable to phishing attacks or social engineering tactics that prey on unsuspecting employees.\n-\nFragmented IT Infrastructure: Public sector organizations can have complex and sprawling IT infrastructures with multiple departments and agencies using different systems. This fragmentation can create blind spots and make it difficult to implement consistent security policies across the board.\n-\nData Trove: Public sector agencies hold a massive amount of sensitive data on citizens, including Social Security numbers, financial information, and medical records. This data is highly valuable to cybercriminals who can use it for identity theft, financial fraud, or further cyberattacks.\n-\nSiloed Information Stores: Public sector agencies have traditionally kept their own data. With a growing requirement to link and pool data, there is a risk of hidden connections being inadvertently exposed.\n-\nLimited Budgetary Resources: Budgetary constraints often restrict public sector organizations' ability to invest in the latest cybersecurity technologies and skilled personnel. These financial issues leave them vulnerable to attacks that exploit known weaknesses.\n-\nRegulatory Compliance: Public sector agencies are subject to a complex web of regulations governing data privacy and security. Balancing compliance with effective cybersecurity practices can be a challenge.\n-\nInternational Focus: Foreign governments or state-sponsored actors engaged in espionage or cyberwarfare can target public sector networks. This adds another layer of complexity to the cybersecurity landscape.\n-\nThe public sector report is just the latest in a series researched and published by Trustwave SpiderLabs.

Researchers drew on resume data from People Data Labs to understand the impact that forced returns to offices had on employee tenure and the movement of workers between companies. What they found was a strong correlation between the departures of senior-level employees and the implementation of a mandate, suggesting that these policies \"had a negative effect on the tenure and seniority of their respective workforce.\" High-ranking employees stayed several months less than they might have without the mandate, the research suggests -- and in many cases, they went to work for direct competitors.\nAt Microsoft, the share of senior employees as a portion of the company's overall workforce declined more than five percentage points after the return-to-office mandate took effect, the researchers found. At Apple, the decline was four percentage points, while at SpaceX -- the only company of the three to require workers to be fully in-person -- the share of senior employees dropped 15 percentage points. \"We find experienced employees impacted by these policies at major tech companies seek work elsewhere, taking some of the most valuable human capital investments and tools of productivity with them,\" said Austin Wright, an assistant professor of public policy at the University of Chicago and one of the study's authors. \"Business leaders should weigh carefully employee preferences and market opportunities when deciding when, or if, they mandate a return to office.\" While the corporate culture and return-to-office policies differ \"markedly\" between the three companies, the similar effects of the RTO mandates suggest that \"the effects are driven by common underlying dynamics,\" wrote the authors of the study.\n\"Our findings suggest that RTO mandates cost the company more than previously thought,\" said David Van Dijcke, a researcher at the University of Michigan who worked on the study. \"These attrition rates aren't just something that can be managed away.\"\nRobert Ployhart, a professor of business administration and management at the University of South Carolina, said executives haven't provided much evidence that RTO mandates actually benefit their workforces. \"The people sitting at the apex may not like the way they feel the organization is being run, but if they're not bringing data to that point of view, it's really hard to argue why people should be coming back to the workplace more frequently,\" Ployhart said.\nSenior employees, he said, are \"the caretakers of a company's culture,\" and having to replace them can have negative effects on team morale and productivity. \"By driving those employees away, they've actually enhanced and sped up the very thing they were trying to stop,\" Ployhart said.\nAt Microsoft, the share of senior employees as a portion of the company's overall workforce declined more than five percentage points after the return-to-office mandate took effect, the researchers found.

Not all of those machines were compromised at the same time,\" explains ESET.\n\"There is a constant churn of new servers being compromised while others are being cleaned up or decommissioned. The data at our disposal doesn\u2019t indicate when the attackers lost access to the systems, so it\u2019s difficult to know the size of the botnet at any specific point in time.\"\nEbury's latest tactics\nRecent Ebury attacks show a preference by the operators to breach hosting providers and perform supply chain attacks to clients renting virtual servers on the compromised provider.\nThe initial compromise is performed via credential stuffing attacks, using stolen credentials to log into the servers.\nOnce a server is compromised, the malware exfiltrates a list of inbound/outband SSH connections from wtmp and the known_hosts file and steals SSH authentication keys, which are then used to try to log into other systems.\n\"When the known_hosts file contains hashed information, the perpetrators try to brute force its content,\" reads ESET's detailed report.\n\"Out of 4.8 million known_hosts entries collected by Ebury operators, about two million had their hostname hashed. 40% (about 800,000) of those hashed hostnames were guessed or brute forced.\"\nAlternatively, and where possible, the attackers may also exploit known vulnerabilities in the software running on the servers to gain further access or elevate their privileges.\nThe hosting provider's infrastructure, including OpenVZ or container hosts, can be leveraged to deploy Ebury across multiple containers or virtual environments.\nIn the next phase, the malware operators intercept SSH traffic on the targeted servers within those data centers by using Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing to redirect traffic to a server under their control.\nOnce a user logs into a compromised server via SSH, Ebury captures the login credentials.\nIn cases where servers host cryptocurrency wallets, Ebury uses the captured credentials to empty the wallets automatically.\nESET says Ebury targeted at least 200 servers using this method throughout 2023, including Bitcoin and Ethereum nodes.\nThe monetization strategies vary, though, and they also include stealing credit card information entered into payment sites, redirecting web traffic to generate revenue from ads and affiliate programs, using compromised servers to send spam, and selling the captured credentials.\nIn late 2023, ESET says it observed the introduction of new obfuscation techniques and a new domain generation algorithm (DGA) system that allows the botnet to evade detection and improve its resilience against blocks.\nThe malware modules spread via the Ebury botnet, based on ESET's latest observations, are:\nHelimodProxy: Proxies raw traffic and relays spam by modifying the mod_dir.so Apache module, allowing the compromised server to run arbitrary commands and support spam campaigns.\n-\nHelimodRedirect: Redirects HTTP traffic to attacker-controlled websites by modifying various Apache and nginx modules to redirect a small percentage of web traffic to malicious sites.\n-\nHelimodSteal: Exfiltrates sensitive information from HTTP POST requests by adding an input filter that intercepts and steals data submitted via web forms, such as login credentials and payment details.\n-\nKernelRedirect: Modifies HTTP traffic at the kernel level to redirect visitors by using a Linux kernel module that hooks into Netfilter, changing the Location header in HTTP responses to redirect users to malicious URLs.\n-\nFrizzySteal: Intercepts and exfiltrates HTTP requests by hooking into libcurl, enabling it to capture and steal data from HTTP requests made by the compromised server.\n-\nESET's latest investigation was carried out in collaboration with the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU), which recently seized a backup server used by the cybercriminals.\nThe Dutch authorities say Ebury actors use fake or stolen identities (via the Vidar Stealer), even assuming the monikers of other cybercriminals sometimes to mislead law enforcement.\nThe NHTCU is investigating evidence found in that server, including virtual machines containing web browsing artifacts such as history and saved logins, but no concrete attributions have been made yet.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

Cases have involved an alleged Iranian drug trafficker with ties to Tehran\u2019s intelligence services being charged in the United States with recruiting a member of the Hells Angels in a plot to murder an Iranian defector.\nSuch groups can provide a layer of deniability for the governments involved, but \u2014 particularly in the cyber domain \u2014 potentially also expose those behind the operations due to shortcomings in tradecraft.\nIn her first major public speech since becoming the director of GCHQ, Keast-Butler told the CyberUK conference in Birmingham that the relationship between the Kremlin and these proxies was changing.\nThe NCSC had previously said that cybercriminals and hacktivisits \u201coperating from within Russia\u2019s borders benefit from the tacit consent of the Russian State.\u201d\nKeast-Butler expanded on this observation, noting that \u201cbefore, Russia simply created the right environments for these groups to operate, but now they are nurturing and inspiring these non-state cyber operations.\u201d\nShe warned that in \u201csome cases\u201d the Russian intelligence services and these proxies were \u201cseemingly co-ordinating physical attacks against the West.\u201d\n\u201cThe Russia threat is acute and globally pervasive.

This way, attackers can know when a specific victim opens one of their emails or clicks on a link, and they can monitor campaign performance,\u201d Palo Alto Networks explains.\nThe attackers would register the domains used in this campaign two to 12 weeks before distributing them to the intended victims, and would continue to monitor the behavior for nine to 11 months. They would typically retire the domains after a year.\nAccording to Palo Alto Networks, the attackers were seen registering new domains for this campaign between October 2020 and January 2024.\nA second campaign, tracked as SpamTracker, has employed a similar technique to track spam delivery, and Palo Alto Networks has identified 44 domains associated with it.\nA third campaign, named SecShow, has been relying on DNS tunneling to scan networks for vulnerabilities, and then perform reflection attacks.\nPalo Alto Networks has observed the attackers scanning for open resolvers, testing resolver delays, exploiting security defects in resolvers, and harvesting time-to-live (TTL) information.\n\u201cThis campaign generally targets open resolvers. As a result, we find victims mainly come from education, high tech, and government fields, where open resolvers are commonly found. This campaign contains three domains, leveraging various subdomains to achieve different network scanning,\u201d Palo Alto Networks says.\nTo mitigate the risk associated with DNS tunneling, organizations are advised to prevent resolvers from accepting unnecessary queries and to make sure their resolvers are running the latest software versions, to prevent the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.\nRelated: Chinese Hackers Have Been Probing DNS Networks Globally for Years: Report\nRelated: KeyTrap DNS Attack Could Disable Large Parts of Internet: Researchers\nRelated: Dangling DNS Used to Hijack Subdomains of Major Organizations", "hash": "8a1672be3340e362abcd04cf60f0c52853ab0ff831c3c4fa6771e43b392d272a", "id": "21a1cc18-0533-4a1b-a698-d61f1b080b39", "link": "https://www.securityweek.com/attackers-use-dns-tunneling-to-track-victim-activity-scan-networks/", "osint_source_id": "12f6122e-c3f7-4d6c-813e-db39f757e369", "published": "2024-05-14T11:44:41", "source": "https://feeds.feedburner.com/Securityweek?format=xml", "story_id": "a5873642-ebc9-4c63-b29b-7e33f5a6d800", "title": "Attackers Use DNS Tunneling to Track Victim Activity, Scan Networks"}], "tags": {"Chinese": {"name": "Chinese", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Internet": {"name": "Internet", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Palo Alto Networks": {"name": "Palo Alto Networks", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "SecShow": {"name": "SecShow", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "TTL": {"name": "TTL", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "TrkCdn": {"name": "TrkCdn", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "phishing": {"name": "phishing", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Attackers Use DNS Tunneling to Track Victim Activity, Scan Networks"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T17:09:10.755633", "id": "4ada5676-af3b-4ce9-80cd-73fd7d395507", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "8"}, {"created": "2024-05-14T17:17:09.502335", "id": "d26eccbb-6a39-4091-8733-a0f3c0b98482", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "16"}], "created": "2024-05-14T11:38:48", "id": "a9e65569-d562-4565-b0e2-72857760ee4b", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Apple Vision Pro soll demn\u00e4chst nach Europa kommen\nAls Tim Cook vor gut einem Jahr die Apple Vision Pro pr\u00e4sentiert hat, wollte er damit eine neue \u00c4ra einl\u00e4uten.

That said, there was an obvious advantage to giving students electronic devices to write with, especially if the resulting text could be easily uploaded to the teacher\u2019s computer for grading. Seeing an opportunity, a couple ex-Apple engineers created the AlphaSmart line of portable word processors.\nThe devices were popular enough in schools that they remained in production until 2013, and since then, they\u2019ve gained a sort of cult following by writers who value their incredible battery life, quality keyboard, and distraction-free nature. But keeping these old machines running with limited spare parts can be difficult, so earlier this year a challenge had been put out by the community to develop 3D printable replacement keys for the AlphaSmart \u2014 a challenge which [Adam Kemp] and his son [Sam] have now answered.\nIn an article published on KBD.news, [Sam] documents the duo\u2019s efforts to design the Creative Commons licensed keycaps for the popular Neo variant of the AlphaSmart. Those who\u2019ve created printable replacement parts probably already know the gist of the write-up, but for the uninitiated, it boils down to measuring, measuring, and measuring some more.\nThings were made more complicated by the fact that the keyboard on the AlphaSmart Neo uses seven distinct types of keys, each of which took their own fine tuning and tweaking to get right. The task ended up being a good candidate for parametric design, where a model can be modified by changing the variables that determine its shape and size. This was better than having to start from scratch for each key type, but the trade-off is that getting a parametric model working properly takes additional upfront effort.\nA further complication was that, instead of using something relatively easy to print like the interface on an MX-style keycap, the AlphaSmart Neo keys snap onto scissor switches. This meant producing them with fused deposition modeling (FDM) was out of the question. The only way to produce such an intricate design at home was to use a resin MSLA printer. While the cost of these machines has come down considerably over the last couple of years, they\u2019re still less than ideal for creating functional parts. [Sam] says getting their keycaps to work reliably on your own printer is likely going to involve some experimentation with different resins and curing times.\n[Adam] tells us he originally saw the call for printable AlphaSmart keycaps here on Hackaday, and as we\u2019re personally big fans of the Neo around these parts, we\u2019re glad they took the project on. Their efforts may well help keep a few of these unique gadgets out of the landfill, and that\u2019s always a win in our book.\n5 thoughts on \u201cPrintable Keycaps Keep The AlphaSmart NEO Kicking\u201d\nWhile the shape is good, there are no labels on the printed keycaps.\nYou still need to sort that out yourself.\nMake a stencil, mix a drop of UV resin with some color of your choice, apply a thin coat then pass it under UV light.\nNail polish might also work fine as wall\noh shit, WHY did I never stumble over this idea?! Thank you! :D\nI spent a lot of time looking for a good solution for writing, and based on comments here I got an Alphasmart. And it\u2019s awesome for writing. Thanks, HAD readers!\nPress a button and it\u2019s on. Not 3 minutes of booting, just press-on, and press-off.\nThe battery lasts a long time. Long enough to take it camping with me, the device will probably last a couple of days of continuous use before the battery gives out.\nYou can power it from a USB powerpack. I used to take one of these with me, the size of a pack of cigarettes, but I don\u2019t any more because I\u2019ve never run down the charge on the builtin battery.\nIt doesn\u2019t do internet, or E-mail, or play YouTube videos, or anything else distracting to the writer. That\u2019s a *big* plus!\nIt has a real keyboard. Not chicklets or on-screen touchpad.\nIt does writing and basic palm-pilot functions (todo list, calendar, contacts &c\u2026 which I don\u2019t use) only.\nI open an editor on my computer, press \u201csend\u201d on the device, and all my text goes into a file. It identifies as an HID keyboard, so it\u2019ll work with any program that takes text entry.\nI like to hike a lot, and I get ideas and thoughts that I want to write down while hiking.

This workaround requires them to turn off the virtual machine's Bluetooth support by unchecking the 'Share Bluetooth devices with the virtual machine' option.\nTwo more high-severity security bugs tracked as CVE-2024-22269 and CVE-2024-22270, reported by Theori and STAR Labs SG, are information disclosure vulnerabilities that allow attackers with local admin privileges to read privileged information from a virtual machine's hypervisor memory.\nThe fourth VMware Workstation and Fusion vulnerability fixed today (tracked as CVE-2024-22268) is caused by a heap buffer overflow weakness in the Shader functionality. A security researcher also reported it through Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.\n\"A malicious actor with non-administrative access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled may be able to exploit this vulnerability to create a denial of service condition,\" VMware says.\nHowever, successfully exploiting this security flaw requires 3D graphics to be enabled on the targeted virtual machine.\nPwn2Own Vancouver 2024 results\nSecurity researchers collected $1,132,500 after demoing 29 zero-days (and some bug collisions) at this year's Vancouver hacking competition, with Manfred Paul emerging as the winner and earning $202,500 in cash after taking down the Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge web browsers.\nDuring the contest, the STAR Labs SG team earned $30,000 after chaining two VMware Workstation security flaws to gain remote code execution.\nTheori security researchers Gwangun Jung and Junoh Lee also went home with $130,000 in cash for escaping a VMware Workstation VM to gain code execution as SYSTEM on the host Windows OS using an exploit chain targeting three vulnerabilities: an uninitialized variable bug, a UAF weakness, and a heap-based buffer overflow.\nGoogle and Mozilla also fixed several zero-days exploited at Pwn2Own Vancouver 2024 within days after the contest ended, with Mozilla releasing patches one day later and Google after just five days.\nHowever, vendors typically take their time to fix security flaws demonstrated at Pwn2Own, as they have 90 days to push patches before Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative publicly discloses bug details.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

The \"saved passwords\" option was checked by default, and the user didn't uncheck it because they assumed the action would only clear passwords from the device's cache. Instead, without requiring the user's password or biometric scan for authentication, the action deleted all their passwords from Google Password Manager.\nClearing a vault from within a browser is not the best take on password security. Google plans to modify the process and remove the \"saved passwords\" toggle altogether, so passwords can't be deleted from the Google Password Manager from within the browser. According to one of Chromium's developers, it will take Google some work before the company makes the change.\nAlso: The best VPNs for streaming your favorite shows and sports\nAs I have recommended for years, the best approach is not to allow your browser to save passwords and, instead, use a full-blown password manager, such as my favorite, Bitwarden. The nice thing about Bitwarden is that it can be easily integrated with other apps, so accessing your passwords is fairly simple.

On iOS, users will get an \"[Item] Found Moving With You\" message.\nRegardless of the operating system, users who receive such an alert have the option to view the tracker's identifier, play a sound to help locate it, and access instructions to disable it.\n\"This cross-platform collaboration \u2014 also an industry first, involving community and industry input \u2014 offers instructions and best practices for manufacturers, should they choose to build unwanted tracking alert capabilities into their products,\" the companies said.\nThe development comes in response to reports that trackers like AirTags are being used by bad actors for malicious or criminal purposes, often abused as a nefarious tracking tool by domestic abusers to stalk their targets.\nA class-action lawsuit filed against Apple in October 2023 alleged that AirTags have become \"one of the most dangerous and frightening technologies employed by stalkers\" and that they can be used to determine \"real-time location information to track victims.\"\nLast year, a group of researchers from Johns Hopkins University and the University of California, San Diego, devised a cryptographic scheme that offers a better trade-off between user privacy and stalker detection through a mechanism called multi-dealer secret sharing (MDSS).\n\"MDSS extends standard secret sharing to admit multiple dealers with multiple secrets while achieving new properties of unlinkability and multi-dealer correctness,\" the academics said in a paper titled \"Abuse-Resistant Location Tracking: Balancing Privacy and Safety in the Offline Finding Ecosystem.\"\nApple Backports Fix for CVE-2024-23296\nThe DULT announcement also follows Apple's decision to backport a fix released in March 2024 for a security flaw in the RTKit real-time operating system (CVE-2024-23296) to devices running older versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.\nThe vulnerability, which allows an attacker with arbitrary kernel read and write capability to bypass kernel memory protections, has come under active exploitation in the wild, although technical specifics on the nature of these attacks are presently unknown.\nPatches for the shortcoming are available in the following versions -\niOS 16.7.8 and iPadOS 16.7.8 - iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad 5th generation, iPad Pro 9.7-inch, and iPad Pro 12.9-inch 1st generation\n-\nmacOS Ventura 13.6.7 - Macs running macOS Ventura\n-\nApple's iOS 17.5 update also remediates a total of 15 security vulnerabilities, including flaws in AppleAVD (CVE-2024-27804) and the kernel (CVE-2024-27818) that could be exploited to cause unexpected app termination or arbitrary code execution.

The highlighted operations are representative of the broader landscape of threats we investigated during this period, illustrating the key trends and developments, and contain only a fraction of the cybersecurity intelligence data provided to customers of ESET\u2019s private APT reports.\nIn the monitored timeframe, several China-aligned threat actors exploited vulnerabilities in public-facing appliances, such as VPNs and firewalls, and software, such as Confluence and Microsoft Exchange Server, for initial access to targets in multiple verticals. Based on the data leak from I-SOON (Anxun), we can confirm that this Chinese contractor is indeed engaged in cyberespionage. We track a part of the company\u2019s activities under the FishMonger group. In this report, we also introduce a new China-aligned APT group, CeranaKeeper, distinguished by unique traits yet possibly sharing a digital quartermaster with the Mustang Panda group.\nFollowing the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023, we detected a significant increase in activity from Iran-aligned threat groups. Specifically, MuddyWater and Agrius transitioned from their previous focus on cyberespionage and ransomware, respectively, to more aggressive strategies involving access brokering and impact attacks. Meanwhile, OilRig and Ballistic Bobcat activities saw a downturn, suggesting a strategic shift toward more noticeable, \"louder\" operations aimed at Israel. North Korea-aligned groups continued to target aerospace and defense companies, and the cryptocurrency industry, improving their tradecraft by conducting supply-chain attacks, developing trojanized software installers and new malware strains, and exploiting software vulnerabilities.\nRussia-aligned groups have focused their activities on espionage within the European Union and attacks on Ukraine. Furthermore, the Operation Texonto campaign, a disinformation and psychological operation (PSYOP) uncovered by ESET researchers, has been spreading false information about Russian-election-related protests and the situation in Ukrainian Kharkiv, fostering uncertainty among Ukrainians domestically and abroad.\nAdditionally, we spotlight a campaign in the Middle East carried out by SturgeonPhisher, a group we believe to be aligned with the interests of Kazakhstan. We also discuss a watering-hole attack on a regional news website about Gilgit-Baltistan, a disputed region administered by Pakistan, and lastly, we describe the exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability in Roundcube by Winter Vivern, a group we assess to be aligned with the interests of Belarus.\nMalicious activities described in ESET APT Activity Report Q4 2023\u2013Q1 2024 are detected by ESET products; shared intelligence is based mostly on proprietary ESET telemetry data and has been verified by ESET researchers.\nESET APT Activity Reports contain only a fraction of the cybersecurity intelligence data provided in ESET APT Reports PREMIUM.

Einem Bericht der Finanznachrichtenagentur Bloomberg zufolge, der am Dienstagmorgen aktualisiert wurde, soll der Verkaufsstart des Mixed-Reality-Headsets nach der Apple-Entwicklerkonferenz WWDC 2024, die vom 10. bis 14. Juni veranstaltet wird, beginnen.\nApple-Store-Mitarbeiter in Cupertino im Training\nDie ersten geplanten L\u00e4nder sind demnach Deutschland, Frankreich, Australien, Japan, S\u00fcdkorea, Singapur und China \u2013 ob nur Festlandchina oder auch Hongkong, Macau und Taiwan, wurde zun\u00e4chst nicht bekannt. Apple hat dazu Apple-Store-Mitarbeiter aus diesen Regionen, die wiederum ihre Kollegen in der Heimat trainieren sollen, nach Cupertino ins Hauptquartier eingeflogen. Dort sollen sie lernen, die Vision Pro an die Kunden zu bringen.\nDie Schulungen dauerten bis zu vier Tage und begannen letzte Woche, so informierte Personen gegen\u00fcber Bloomberg. Den Mitarbeitern hat Apple demnach bislang nicht mitgeteilt, in welchen M\u00e4rkten die Vision Pro starten wird. Sie ist seit dem 2. Februar allein in den USA erh\u00e4ltlich. F\u00fcr China soll es am Montag eine Zertifizierung des Ger\u00e4ts seitens der Regulierungsbeh\u00f6rde Quality Certification Center gegeben haben, ohne die ein Verkauf auf diesem Markt nicht m\u00f6glich w\u00e4re. Apple wollte den Bericht nicht kommentieren.\nPreise in Europa wohl bei 4000 Euro\nFr\u00fcheren Berichten zufolge sollte die Vision Pro bereits vor der WWDC in den internationalen Handel kommen, doch es scheint zu einer Verz\u00f6gerung gekommen zu sein. Apple kann neue M\u00e4rkte gut gebrauchen. Das mindestens 3500 US-Dollar (plus Steuer) teure Headset ist aufgrund seines Preises kein Massenprodukt. Zuletzt sollen die Verk\u00e4ufe, die Apple offiziell nicht kommentiert, zur\u00fcckgegangen sein.\nIn Europa k\u00f6nnte die Vision Pro rund 4000 Euro kosten und damit ebenfalls ein Luxusprodukt sein. Die Brille bietet zwei 4K-Screens, Bedienung \u00fcber Augentracking und ein eigenes Software-\u00d6kosystem, das sich auch bei iPadOS- und iOS-Apps bedienen kann.

This gives the attackers the ability to plant malware and steal information.\n-\nWhat probably makes the attack particularly effective is the combined use of both email and phone calls. Many users might naturally be suspicious of emails that arrive in their inbox, but more trusting of phone calls - particularly if they refer to a problem that they really are having with their inbox (namely, a flood of unwanted email that is interrupting their ability to do their job).\nIn order to better safeguard your organisation against ransomware threats, consider implementing the following security measures:\nRegularly back up your data to a secure, offsite location. This ensures that you can recover your information even if your systems are compromised.\n-\nKeep your security software up-to-date and install the latest patches for your operating systems and applications. This helps protect against known software vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.\n-\nUse strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and enable multi-factor authentication. This adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.\n-\nEncrypt sensitive data whenever possible. This makes the data unreadable to anyone without the decryption key, even if they steal it.\n-\nMinimise your attack surface by disabling any unnecessary services or features to reduce potential entry points for attackers.\n-\nEducate your staff about the risks of cyberattacks and how to recognise the common tactics used by criminals. This helps raise awareness and empowers employees to make informed decisions about security.\n-\nKnowing how to respond, particularly in the first 48 hours after a cyber attack, is critical.\nThe best approach is to take proactive measures and have emergency plans in place because it's not a matter of if, but when, your business will suffer a ransomware attack.\nMake sure to read Exponential-e's step-by-step guide on ransomware remediation.\nWhen you subscribe to the blog, we will send you an e-mail when there are new updates on the site so you wouldn't miss them.", "hash": "b2a82329ec37b28af8eac70b3060a9824223a3225faee06d54577f06b3519956", "id": "29ba8709-2610-4e93-83a2-3952152cd484", "link": "https://www.exponential-e.com/blog/black-basta-ransomware-groups-techniques-evolve-as-fbi-issues-new-warning-in-wake-of-hospital-attack", "osint_source_id": "62e82a43-5500-4ccc-aa1c-1894622c7d77", "published": "2024-05-14T10:15:02", "source": "https://www.grahamcluley.com/feed/", "story_id": "3954183d-45a9-4e42-9da5-74952ffa2f4a", "title": "Black Basta ransomware group\u2019s techniques evolve, as FBI issues new warning in wake of hospital attack"}], "tags": {"Australia": {"name": "Australia", "tag_type": "Country"}, "CISA": {"name": "CISA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Canada": {"name": "Canada", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Exponential-e": {"name": "Exponential-e", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "FBI": {"name": "FBI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "HPH": {"name": "HPH", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "India": {"name": "India", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Multi-factor authentication": {"name": "Multi-factor authentication", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "New Zealand": {"name": "New Zealand", "tag_type": "Country"}, "UAE": {"name": "UAE", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "United States": {"name": "United States", "tag_type": "Country"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Black Basta ransomware group\u2019s techniques evolve, as FBI issues new warning in wake of hospital attack"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T17:15:00.312255", "id": "9a17b7d4-7cd1-4b97-90d7-fb4f0c396bc8", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "7"}, {"created": "2024-05-14T17:11:25.410916", "id": "9ae4d4a5-198e-4b2c-a848-0f5ca77a0cad", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-14T10:00:00", "id": "a76c06f8-c0cc-444e-8407-c022bd51b698", "news_items": [{"author": "Jill_Armour_Microsoft", "content": "Cloud 9 Infosystems digitally transforms businesses to reduce costs by leveraging the extensibility of the cloud\n \nCloud 9 Infosystems is a Microsoft gold partner and Tier 1 cloud solution provider for data analytics, cloud platform, application development, and application integration.

Das betrifft vor allem die Bereiche, in denen ein Ausfall eines Ger\u00e4ts schwerwiegende Folgen haben kann, also zum Beispiel die Luftfahrt oder die Medizintechnik.\nDie dabei durch den Hersteller angestrebte Manipulationssicherheit soll unter anderem gew\u00e4hrleisten, dass die funktionale Sicherheit (Safety) nicht durch Dritte beeinflusst wurde und etwaige Regularien (Wartungszyklen, Nutzungszeitr\u00e4ume etc.) nachweisbar eingehalten wurden bzw. eine durchgef\u00fchrte Manipulation nachtr\u00e4glich erkennbar ist.\nEin Beispiel w\u00e4re ein Reinigungs- oder Desinfektionsger\u00e4t f\u00fcr ein hier nicht n\u00e4her spezifiziertes Objekt, welches nach 1000 erfassten Reinigungs- oder Desinfektionszyklen gewartet werden muss, um sicherzustellen, dass die Reinigungs- oder Desinfektionsleistung noch den definierten/geforderten Grenzwerten entspricht. Eine \u00dcberschreitung dieser Zyklen k\u00f6nnte beispielsweise zu einer unzureichenden Reinigungs- oder Desinfektionsleistung f\u00fchren, was in der Medizintechnik beispielsweise gravierende Auswirkungen auf den damit behandelten Patienten haben oder das damit bearbeitete Objekt langfristig besch\u00e4digen k\u00f6nnte. Um dies zu verhindern, k\u00f6nnte das Ger\u00e4t sowohl bei \u00dcberschreitung der vorgegebenen Zyklen als auch bei einer versuchten Manipulation dieser den weiteren Betrieb einstellen, bis ein Servicetechniker die ordnungsgem\u00e4\u00dfe Funktionalit\u00e4t wieder sicherstellen kann. Das eingesetzte Ger\u00e4t muss dazu beispielsweise die Anzahl der Verwendungen oder die Betriebsdauer erfassen, um den Betrieb dann zu einem passenden Zeitpunkt einstellen zu k\u00f6nnen.\nUm sicherzustellen, dass solche Werte nicht manipuliert werden k\u00f6nnen, werden zumeist spezielle Sicherheitschips (Secure Element) verbaut, wie zum Beispiel der ATECC508A von Microchip.\nEin Secure Element oder Sicherheitschip bietet die M\u00f6glichkeit, Schl\u00fcsselmaterial, Zertifikate, Daten und Konfigurationen sicher zu speichern. Im Normalfall kann das Schl\u00fcsselmaterial nicht wieder ausgelesen werden. Es werden dann verschiedene kryptografische Funktionen angeboten, die vom Chip \u00fcbernommen werden. Zum Beispiel k\u00f6nnen Signaturen mit dem hinterlegten Schl\u00fcsselmaterial berechnet werden. Dabei werden die zu signierenden Daten an den Chip gesendet und dieser berechnet dann die Signatur und sendet diese zur\u00fcck. Das Schl\u00fcsselmaterial wird f\u00fcr die Berechnung verwendet, muss jedoch den Chip nicht verlassen.\nDer ATECC508A bietet zus\u00e4tzlich einen Zufallszahlgenerator, Speicher zum Speichern von beliebigen Daten und zwei Z\u00e4hler. F\u00fcr die unterschiedlichen Segmente des Speichers k\u00f6nnen verschiedene Schutzattribute gesetzt werden, die zum Beispiel keine \u00c4nderungen der gespeicherten Daten mehr erlauben.\nEin Z\u00e4hler hat zwei Funktionen: eine, um den aktuellen Z\u00e4hlerwert um eins zu erh\u00f6hen, und die andere, um den aktuellen Wert auszulesen. Ein Zur\u00fccksetzen des Z\u00e4hlers ist nicht m\u00f6glich.\nIm Falle des ATECC508A wird die Kommunikation zum Hauptchip des Ger\u00e4ts \u00fcber einen I2C Bus realisiert. Die Kommunikation zwischen dem Hauptchip des Ger\u00e4ts und dem Secure Element ist erst einmal unverschl\u00fcsselt. F\u00fcr das Schreiben und das Lesen des Speichers k\u00f6nnen jedoch Schl\u00fcssel hinterlegt werden. Die Kommunikation wird dann mit diesen Schl\u00fcsseln und einer XOR-Verschl\u00fcsselung verschl\u00fcsselt.\nWelche Fallstricke gibt es bei der Implementierung eines Secure Elements? Ist die Manipulationssicherheit bereits dadurch gew\u00e4hrleistet, dass das Secure Element nicht manipuliert werden kann?\nBei den folgenden Themen sind h\u00e4ufig Probleme anzutreffen:\nEin Secure Element stellt normalerweise einen sicheren Ort f\u00fcr Schl\u00fcsselmaterial bereit. Beim Einsatz von symmetrischer Verschl\u00fcsselung, wie zum Beispiel beim verschl\u00fcsselten Schreiben oder Lesen des Speichers beim ATECC508A, muss das Schl\u00fcsselmaterial zus\u00e4tzlich auch im Hauptcontroller des Ger\u00e4ts gespeichert werden. Um den Schl\u00fcssel sicher zu speichern, ben\u00f6tigt der Hauptcontroller einen gesch\u00fctzten Speicherbereich, der nicht ohne Weiteres ausgelesen werden kann. Ein Ablegen des Schl\u00fcssels in der Firmware birgt daher ein gro\u00dfes Risiko, dass ein Angreifer das Schl\u00fcsselmaterial extrahieren kann.\nUm das Auslesen zu verhindern, m\u00fcssen in der Regel auch alle Debug-Schnittstellen (z. B. JTAG, SWD) des Hauptcontrollers deaktiviert sein. \u00dcber die Debug-Schnittstellen kann zumeist auf den Speicher des Hauptcontrollers zugegriffen werden. Alternativ kann ein Angreifer mit dem Debugger direkt in den Programmablauf eingreifen und das Schl\u00fcsselmaterial extrahieren. Zus\u00e4tzlich sollte bedacht werden, dass die Schl\u00fcssel bei der Provisionierung f\u00fcr jedes Ger\u00e4t individuell gew\u00e4hlt werden. Gelingt es einem Angreifer, aus einem Ger\u00e4t die Schl\u00fcssel zu extrahieren, so kann er nicht auf den Speicher aller baugleichen Ger\u00e4te zugreifen.\nEs scheint, als seien die vorhandenen Z\u00e4hler pr\u00e4destiniert f\u00fcr das manipulationsfreie Z\u00e4hlen von Betriebsstunden. Eine Implementierung, die nach jeder zuvor definierten Bedingung den Counter erh\u00f6ht, scheint auf den ersten Blick nicht manipulierbar.\nEin Angreifer, der jedoch das Ger\u00e4t manipuliert und eine Machine-in-the Middle-Position auf dem I2C Bus einnimmt, kann allerdings beispielsweise den Befehl zum Erh\u00f6hen des Z\u00e4hlerwerts einfach nicht vom Hauptcontroller an den ATECC508A weiterleiten. Der Z\u00e4hlvorgang findet folglich nie statt. Da ein Angreifer in der Position auch die Antwort des ATECC508A an den Hauptcontroller manipulieren kann, ist eine \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung des Z\u00e4hlerwerts ebenfalls manipulierbar.\nWird der I2C Bus zwischen Hauptcontroller und ATECC508A nicht in einer \u00fcberpr\u00fcfbar sicheren Umgebung betrieben, so m\u00fcssen weitere Schritte zur Verifizierung des Z\u00e4hlvorgangs implementiert werden. Dabei kann eine weitere spezielle Funktion des ATECC508A helfen, die den Z\u00e4hler erh\u00f6ht, wenn ein hinterlegter Schl\u00fcssel verwendet wird. Hierdurch kann man eine kryptografisch verifizierbare Aktion auf dem ATECC508A ausl\u00f6sen und in Folge dessen einen authentifizierten Z\u00e4hlvorgang.\nBei einem Penetrationstest eines solchen Ger\u00e4ts muss die Kommunikation zwischen dem Secure Element und dem Hauptcontroller untersucht werden, um Fehler in der Implementierung zu erkennen. Dabei sind folgende Schritte notwendig:\nUm den Kommunikationsablauf einfacher zu verstehen, hat die SySS eine Erweiterung f\u00fcr die Software Saleae Logic 2 entwickelt (https://github.com/SySS-Research/logic2-atecc508-extension), die eine solche I2C-Kommunikation mit dem ATECC508A aufgliedert.\nKonnten die beiden Schl\u00fcssel zum verschl\u00fcsselten Lesen und Schreiben des Speichers aus dem Hauptcontroller extrahiert werden, so werden die Schreib- und Lesevorg\u00e4nge direkt entschl\u00fcsselt dargestellt.

A classic example of this has been using the popular Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern (e.g. https://github.com/Azure/GPT-RAG) in which enterprise documents are used as context to answer user questions. These implementations can reduce time spent sifting through lengthy documentation and promote awareness throughout an organization.\n \nBut what about using LLMs to extract insights from structured relational data such as SQL databases? Many enterprises possess enormous amounts of SQL data that currently requires technical expertise to query or build business dashboards to make this data accessible to end users. However, it is costly to build these dashboards and they are limited in their scope.\n \nWith LLMs, there is a new potential to enable non-technical users to extract information from SQL databases by using an LLM to dynamically generate SQL queries, execute those SQL queries, and use the results as context to an LLM to provide a response to the end user. This use case has potential to enhance understanding of business data and reduce time and money spent on extracting data from SQL databases.\n \nThis guide will show multiple approaches to building a chat application that leverages SQL data as context. We will start with the simplest architecture and work progressively toward more sophisticated methods to address limitations.\n \nNote: Truncated prompts will be provided in the examples below, but more complete and comprehensive prompts will be included in the final section.\n \nArchitecture 1: Few Shot SQL Generation\nIn this first implementation of an NL to SQL chat app, the LLM builds a SQL query based on the user\u2019s question and a fixed SQL schema that is included in the system prompt.\n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Few Shot SQL Generation\n \n\nUser asks a question: through a front end UI, the user submits a question. For example, \u201cWhat was the product line with the highest revenue in 2022?\u201d\nApp makes a request to the LLM: the LLM is invoked with a prompt that might look like the following (for more comprehensive prompts see Appendix A),\n\n\u201cYou are an expert at providing facts from a SQL Database. Given the user question, produce a PostgresSQL query which, when executed provides the correct answer to the question. Only use the tables and schema given below to answer the question. SQL Schema: {Schema}\nUser Question: {Question}\u201d\n \n\nLLM responds with a SQL query: the LLM will generate a SQL query string as a response that might look like, \u201cSELECT p.product_line, SUM(s.revenue) AS total_revenue \u2026 \u201c. This string gets stored as a variable, to be used in the next step.\nSQL Query string is executed, result is saved: the previous string that was generated is sent to the SQL query to be executed. The result of the SQL query will be saved as a text string (e.g. \u201cHome Appliances, $12,500,000\u201d)  Note: this poses a potential risk of SQL injection, ensure you are limiting permissions, and see final section regarding Security and Safety\nFinal LLM call performed: A second request is sent to the LLM, this time with the user\u2019s original question, and the result of SQL Query. The prompt might look like:\n\n\u201cGiven the original question, the corresponding PostgreSQL query, and the execution results, produce a truthful and accurate natural language response to the original question.\nQuestion: {question}\u201d\n\nFinal Response: The LLM responds with the answer to the user\u2019s question, based on the SQL query results.\n\n\u00a0\nBenefits / Limitations: This architecture is quite simple and benefits in terms of latency by having only two LLM calls. However, this setup is limited because the LLM does not have any examples of valid SQL queries to reference.\n\u00a0\nArchitecture 2: Few Shot SQL Generation with RAG\nThis implementation is similar to the previous architecture, but rather than having a fixed set of few-shot examples, we create a data preparation step in which example queries are embedded into a vector database and then retrieved at run time.\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Few Shot SQL Generation with RAG\n\u00a0\nBelow, we discuss the new steps that differentiate Architecture 2 from Architecture 1:\n\nOffline Data Prep: In order to best leverage the few shot examples framework, a set of example user questions and corresponding SQL queries (50-100 samples) should be collected and stored in JSON or CSV format. Then, each of these pairs should be embedded in a vector database such as Azure AI Search (Search over JSON blobs - Azure AI Search | Microsoft Learn).{\n  \"question\": \"Which product line had the highest sales in FY2022?\"\n  \"sql_query\": \"SELECT value FROM table_1...\"\n}\n(Runtime) User submits question -\u00a0After the data preparation in step 1, the application starts in the same way as Architecture 1. The user submits a question, and the app sends the question first to the embeddings deployment of Azure OpenAI.\nEmbed user\u2019s question: Make a request to a text embeddings model, such as text-ada-002, to convert the user\u2019s question to a vector. \nRetrieve few shot examples: Then retrieve the top 5 examples with the closest similarity (using Azure AI Search cosine similarity algorithm) and include them in the SQL Generation request to GPT-4.\nSteps 5-8:\u00a0Proceed in the same order as Architecture 1. The SQL string is generated, executed, and the results are used as context to provide the final response to the end user.\n\nBenefits / Limitations: This architecture is quite simple and benefits in terms of latency by having only two LLM calls. However, this setup is limited because the LLM does not have any examples of valid SQL queries to reference.\n\u00a0\nArchitecture 3: Fine Tuning SQL Generation with GPT 3.5T\nOne of the central challenges in building an NL to SQL based chat application is handling latency. One method to reduce latency is by opting to fine tune a smaller model, such as GPT 3.5T for the SQL generation step.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Fine Tuning SQL Generation with GPT 3.5T\n\u00a0\nThis architecture follows roughly the same pattern as architecture 1, but with a preparatory fine tuning step.\n\u00a0\n\nOffline Fine Tuning \u2013 Collect 50-100 NL questions and corresponding SQL Queries. Use Azure OpenAI\u2019s fine tuning capability to fine tune your GPT 3.5 deployment (Customize a model with Azure OpenAI Service - Azure OpenAI | Microsoft Learn)\nSteps 2-7 \u2013 Same as architecture 1, but directed toward the fine tuned instance of GPT 3.5T.\n\nNote: If sufficient NL / SQL samples are available, fine tuning could be used with RAG to include few shot examples in addition to the fine tuning. Users should experiment with the exact number of samples to include to get best results and ensure to test with unseen samples.\n\u00a0\nEvaluation\nIn order to evaluate an NL to SQL project you will need to evaluate the accuracy of the generated SQL query, the final response, and latency for each step. Below, we outline some of the key metrics to capture during the evaluation stage.\n\u00a0\nManual Metrics:\nThe simplest way of evaluating the application is to have a human evaluator look at the final response and determine if it answer\u2019s the user\u2019s original question correctly. An example of this is\u00a0End-to-End Accuracy.\n\nEnd-to-End Accuracy \u2013 does the final response correctly answer the user\u2019s question?\n\nHow to implement: Output all question and answers to a spreadsheet, and have a human validator enter 1 or 0 in each row to indicate whether the answer was correct or incorrect. Correct Answers / Total Answers = Accuracy.\n\n\n\nOne of the limitations with this method is that it requires a human to review each response, which can be labor-intensive. Additionally, if the answer is marked incorrect, it may not be clear which part of the process failed. For this reason, we also introduce a set of automated metrics to evaluate each step of the process.\n\u00a0\nAutomated Metrics:\nBelow we introduce four automated metrics, which can be executed immediately without human reviewers in a scalable fashion.\n\u00a0\n\nValidity of SQL Query \u2013 Is the generated SQL query valid?\n\nHow to Implement: This can be scored using a python library like sqlvalidator, or by implementing logic into the code to log each instance in which the SQL query fails.\n\n\nSQL Critic Score \u2013 Does the SQL Query and result correctly translate the original question?\n\nHow to implement: Use the LLM to evaluate itself by sending a prompt with instructions to validate the accuracy of the SQL Query and include the original question, SQL query, and result in the request (see Appendix B Example 5)\n\n\nEnd-to-End Relevance \u2013 Is the generated NL response relevant to the user\u2019s initial question?\n\nHow to implement: Send a prompt to the LLM with instructions to compare the NL response to the user\u2019s initial question and evaluate its relevance (see Appendix B Example 6)\n\n\nEnd-to-End Groundedness \u2013 Does the generated NL response logically follow from the context provided to it (i.e. the SQL Query)?\n\nHow to implement: Send a prompt to the LLM with instructions to compare the NL response to the SQL query and results and determine if the response logically follows (see Appendix B Example 7)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 NL to SQL Evaluation Metrics\n\u00a0\nSafety and Security\nLLMs introduce new risks to a web application. In this case, the LLM is generating SQL code that will be executed. This introduces a attack surface, and the appropriate boundaries should be introduced prior to releasing to public.\n\u00a0\nNL to SQL systems require various safety precautions to ensure accurate, secure, and unbiased results. Here are some key aspects to consider.\n\u00a0\nRisks:\n\nSQL Injection\nHandling ambiguity and vagueness\nMitigating bias\nUnintentionally writing to database\n\n\u00a0\nMitigations:\n\nGranular permissions and proper authorization \u2013 refine access based on roles and groups.\nEnsure access to known users.\nImplement parameterized queries that separate data from the query itself.\nEnsure read-only and only execute permissions.\nImplement strict input validation and sanitization procedures with whitelisting, regular expressions, data type checks, escaping.\nImplement logging and monitoring.\nExplainability and transparency\n\n\u00a0\nAdditional resources\n\nHow to use Semantic Kernel to execute natural language to SQL queries\nDataherald: An open-source project to query your structured data in natural language.\nhttps://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/best-practices-to-architect-secure-generative-ai-applications/ba-p/4116661\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/sql-server-security-best-practices?view=sql-server-ver16\n\nAppendix A: Prompt Examples\nExample 1: NL to SQL System Prompt\n\"You are an expert in providing facts from an SQL database.

Eine betr\u00e4chtliche Menge an Energie geht n\u00e4mlich verloren, bevor man den Wasserstoff selbst \u00fcberhaupt als Energiequelle nutzen kann.\nMit einer relativ neuen Methode will ein Start-up aus Australien eine hocheffiziente Wasserstoffherstellung im industriellen Ma\u00dfstab umsetzen. Die Energieverluste sollen dabei minimal ausfallen. F\u00fcr den Ausbau der Produktionskapazit\u00e4ten hat Hysata vor einigen Tagen ein Investment von 111 Millionen US-Dollar erhalten.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Wasserstoff billiger produzieren: Forschern gelingt wichtiger Schritt\nKaum Energieverluste\nDer Energieverlust bei der Herstellung von Wasserstoff liegt normalerweise zwischen 20 und 30 Prozent. Es werden ungef\u00e4hr 52,5 kWh ben\u00f6tigt, um einen Kilogramm Wasserstoff zu produzieren, der 39,4 kWh an Energie enth\u00e4lt.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Was bedeutet gr\u00fcner Wasserstoff wirklich f\u00fcr die Energiewende?\nHysata hat mit seiner Methode gezeigt, dass sie f\u00fcr die Herstellung von einem Kilogramm Wasserstoff einen Energieeinsatz von lediglich 41,5 kWh ben\u00f6tigen. Das entspricht einer Effizienz von 95 Prozent, die auch bei der industriellen Elektrolyse gew\u00e4hrleistet sein sollen.\nUnter Laborbedingungen erreichte Hysata sogar 98 Prozent. Der hocheffiziente Ansatz wurde eigentlich an der University of Wollongong in Australien entwickelt. Die Forschungsergebnisse dazu sind bereits 2022 in der Fachpublikation Nature erschienen.\nKapillaren statt Pumpen\nHysata setzt auf kapillargespeiste Elektrolyseure, die im Vergleich zu herk\u00f6mmlichen Aufbauten deutlich g\u00fcnstiger sein sollen, wie das Start-up erkl\u00e4rt. Der gesamte Prozess sei zudem weniger komplex, da weniger Pumpen notwendig sind. Durch die kapillargespeiste Elektrolysezelle entstehen w\u00e4hrend des Vorgangs weniger Blasen, weshalb die Elektrolyse deutlich effizienter sei.\nBei der Kapillarelektrolyse wird das Wasser kontinuierlich durch den Kapillareffekt vom Boden der Zelle angesaugt. Durch die hauchd\u00fcnnen Haarr\u00f6hrchen wird das Wasser zu den Elektroden transportiert, sodass die beiden Elektroden nicht mehr direkt im Wasser stehen m\u00fcssen.\nEin weiterer Vorteil sei, dass die beiden Gase - Wasserstoff und Sauerstoff - durch die Kapillarmethode problemlos entweichen k\u00f6nnen. Wenn sich die Elektroden im Wasser befinden w\u00fcrden, w\u00fcrden sich daran Gasbl\u00e4schen bilden, die den Zugang zu den Elektroden erschweren. Beim Ansatz von Hysata ist das nicht der Fall.

In this fifth and final part of the series,\u202fwe will cover the different overrides, why you may need them, and why it isn\u2019t a good idea to keep them permanently.  \nEmail security is a critical aspect of modern business operations, and Microsoft 365 provides a robust set of tools to keep your communications safe. But what should you do when legitimate emails are blocked? This is where submissions and overrides come into play. As we have covered in part 2 of this series, Submissions help you learn more about why email was junked or quarantined and allow you to notify Microsoft if the filters got it wrong. (It happens.) Overrides are special settings that allow certain emails to bypass the usual security filters, ensuring important communications reach their destination. \nA closer look at email overrides \nOverrides are not one-size-fits-all; they come in different forms to suit various needs. Use Explorer email summary flyout and email entity pages to learn more about why a message was delivered to a certain location, and if overrides played a role in delivery. Note, since messages can have multiple allow or block overrides as identified in the column\u202fOverride source, the override that ultimately allowed or blocked the message is identified in\u202fPrimary override source in Explorer.\n \nLearn more: Understanding overrides within the email entity page in Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Understanding detection technology within the email entity page in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 \n \n\nTenant Allow Block List (TABL): Ideal for creating temporary and safe exceptions. Based on your submission, Microsoft will analyze the exact part of the email deemed malicious (sender, domain, URL, file hash, spoof, or impersonation). TABL is the preferred choice for maintaining security: \u201cAllows\u201d eventually expire, and until they do, the system learns from your submissions to allow emails with similar elements. Both easy for you to manage, and useful for service filter adjustments. A win-win! \n\nNote: spoof overrides do not expire. Learn more here: Allow or block email using the Tenant Allow/Block List \n\nExchange Mail Flow Rules (Exchange Transport Rules or ETRs): ETRs provide the most flexibility but come with increased risk. They should be used sparingly and thoughtfully. Safer ETR overrides use conditions for email authentication checks passing before allowing anything (see an example). The Analysis tab of the email entity page in Explorer will help you verify which ETR acted on a message, and the anti-spam message headers will include SFV:SKN if an ETR override is detected.  \n\n\nFigure 1: \u201cAllowed by organization policy: Exchange transport rule\u201d override source on the Email Entity page in Microsoft Defender XDR \n \n\nOutlook Safe Senders (User Overrides): Users can mark their own trusted senders in Outlook, affecting only their individual mailbox. The screenshot below demonstrates the detailed information from the email entity page in Microsoft Defender XDR, and the anti-spam message headers will include SFV:SFE if a user override is detected.   \nFigure 2: \u201cAllowed by user policy: Sender address list\u201d override source on the Email Entity page in Microsoft Defender XDR\u00a0\n\n\nCertain user allows \u201cwin\u201d over tenant configurations and provide the end-users the ability to manage their own exceptions, so make sure to review the \u201cUser and tenant settings conflict\u201d section to learn what to expect at Order and precedence of email protection.\nTip: List all overrides for a user or all users in your organization using the PowerShell cmdlet. For full syntax and examples, see Get-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nIP Allow List (Connection Filtering): This allows emails from specified IP addresses to bypass filters as part of connection filtering. One risk here is if an IP you believe is trusted becomes compromised, the entire email filtering stack except Secure by default is bypassed. Another risk is adding IP overrides for shared IP addresses or ranges. If bad actors use the same sender infrastructure for malicious purposes, you will allow bad messages along with good ones. In short: exercise caution, review regularly, keep IP allows to a minimum. The anti-spam message headers will include IPV:CAL if an IP override is detected, and the Explorer email entity page will look like this:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFigure 3: \u201cAllowed by organization policy: Connection policy\u201d override source on the Email Entity page in Microsoft Defender XDR\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nAnti-Phishing Policy Overrides: Aimed at combating domain, user and mailbox impersonation phishing threats, these overrides will target false positives with UIMP, DIMP, GIMP verdicts only. They are relatively safer as the rest of the protection scans take place, but it\u2019s still a good idea to make sure from time to time any trusted senders and domains are still necessary, as they never expire.\u00a0\n\nTip: You can also use Tenant Allow/Block List for impersonation overrides, just note that the allow entry isn't created in the Tenant Allow/Block List. Instead, the domain or sender is added to the\u202fTrusted senders and domains section\u202fin the\u202fanti-phishing policy\u202fthat detected the message and it does not expire.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nExample\u00a0The company CEO, John Smith (johnsmith@contoso.com) is a prime target for impersonation attacks, so your SecOps team adds his address to trusted users to protect in the anti-phishing policy. However, the CEO sometimes sends email to his team from his personal account (johnsmith@outlook.com). After the service flags this correctly as user impersonation, you add the CEO\u2019s personal address to trusted senders, for his emails to get through to recipient inboxes. (Of course, after you educate the CEO about the risks tied to this practice, you remove this entry.)\u00a0\n\nFigure 4: Add trusted senders part of the anti-phishing policy in Microsoft Defender XDR\n\u00a0\n\nAnti-Spam Policy Overrides: used to override spam, bulk, spoofing and low-confidence phishing verdicts (SPM, HSPM, PHISH, SPOOF and BULK), anti-spam policy senders and/or domains allows also override the anti-phishing stack, and they do not expire. Overly broad (domain) allows are particularly risky and known to be a leading cause for letting bad email into your inboxes. Best practice, review your policies periodically and trim/clear these lists. The Analysis tab of the email entity page in Explorer will help you verify if a policy that acted on a message, and the anti-spam message headers will include SFV:SKA if a policy override is detected.\u00a0\n\nTip: You can also export an extended report (message trace) for the email in question. The AGENTINFO event in the resulting csv file contains the CustomData field with additional details, such as the GUID of the policy that acted on the message. For example:\u00a0\nS:PCFA=SUM|tact=5|di=SQ|tactcat=SPM|hctfp=191b78dc-9221-4a2c-b51c-208a186e931a; SQ means the message was routed to Spam Quarantine, and hctfp stands for Hosted Content Filter Policy. Find the policy name by running the cmdlet Get-HostedContentFilteringPolicy in Exchange Online PowerShell.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWhile most of this article is about allow overrides, you can use Anti-Spam policies to block email, as well. For example, filter messages containing geographies and languages you would not expect to be working with. Learn how to configure spam filter policies.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSecure by Default\u00a0\nMicrosoft 365 Secure by Default stance ensures that the system starts with the highest security settings. Notably, verdicts for malware (MALW) and high-confidence phishing (HPHISH) cannot be overridden by ETRs if the MX record points to Office 365. This policy is in place to protect users from the most severe threats automatically.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhy would I ever override Secure by Default?\u00a0\nThere are specific instances where an override may be necessary. It is highly recommended to configure the Advanced delivery policy to handle these uses cases securely.\u00a0\n\nPhishing Simulations: To test their defenses, organizations might run controlled phishing simulations. To ensure these tests reach inboxes when they\u2019re sent over email, overrides are essential.\u00a0\u00a0\nSecOps Mailboxes: Security teams sometimes need to examine malicious emails for analysis and learning. Access to such emails requires an override to allow them through.\u00a0\n\nLearn more:\u00a0Configure the advanced delivery policy for third-party phishing simulations and email delivery to SecOps mailboxes\n\u00a0\nWhat if the MX record for my domain does not point to Exchange Online Protection?\u00a0\nSecure by default applies only when the MX record for your domain points to Microsoft 365 (contoso-com.mail.protection.outlook.com). If the MX record points to another service or device, it's possible to override high-confidence phishing verdicts using an Exchange mail flow rule to\u202fbypass spam filtering (malware verdicts cannot be overridden).\u00a0 But although it\u2019s technically possible, consider the benefits of defense-in-depth of your filtering solution paired with Microsoft Defender for Office 365. Use Enhanced Filtering for Connectors to skip the last known IP address(es) of your service, and to infer the email authentication information from the original sender IP. In addition, if your filtering solution supports ARC, configure to trust the ARC sealer in Microsoft Defender XDR settings. These configurations will allow you to keep the extra layer of Microsoft protection even when using third party protections. \u00a0\nLearn more about Getting started with defense in-depth configuration for email security, Secure by default in Office 365, Manage mail flow using a third-party cloud service with Exchange Online and Configure trusted ARC sealers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMessages I send land in spam folders for external recipients. Can I override outbound spam filtering?\u00a0\u00a0\nNo. However, you can take steps to authenticate outbound email to improve deliverability.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUse overrides wisely\u00a0\nWhile overrides are useful tools, they must be implemented wisely. Incorrect usage can inadvertently open your company to threats. It\u2019s essential to take the following precautions:\u00a0\n\nOnly allow emails from verified and trustworthy sources. And even when you trust the source, consider that it may become compromised, and you would inadvertently allow unwanted phishing or spam.\u00a0\nUse Advanced Hunting in Microsoft Defender XDR to help you discover top overrides sources and remove the unnecessary ones.\u00a0\nRegularly review your overrides to ensure they remain relevant and secure.\u00a0\nNever put domains that you own onto the Allow and blocklists. If you own Contoso, do not add contoso.com to your allow lists.\u00a0\nNever put common domains, such as microsoft.com and office.com, onto the Allow and blocklists.\u00a0\n\nWe hope that by understanding and applying email overrides correctly, you can ensure your organization\u2019s email is both secure and functional, allowing the right messages to get through while keeping the bad ones out.\u00a0\nDo you have questions or feedback about Microsoft Defender for Office 365?

We also answered some of the questions that you asked us in the previous episode, such as:\n\nHow to work with local models\nHow to use semantic kernel\nHow to evaluate different models.\n\n \nOne of the main topics that we discussed was the AI samples repo, where we are adding artificial intelligence samples for .NET developers. You can find scenarios such as text summarization, chat, data generation, image generation, and more. You can also choose between using semantic kernel or the Azure Open AI SDK to interact with the models.\n \nWe also showed you how to switch between different models, such as GPT-4, Phi-3 and Llama, using the same code and API. We also shared some links to other resources, such as the Azure Developer .NET Day, where you can learn more about AI, GitHub Copilot, SQL Server, and other topics.\n \nAnother topic that we covered was the model evaluation sample, which is a work in progress that we are going to present at Build 2024.  (you can check the PR here). The idea behind this sample is to help you evaluate different models that you may want to use or fine-tune for your own applications. We showed you how to use a console application that uses semantic kernel to generate questions and answers, user stories, and other inputs, and then evaluate them using different metrics, such as coherence, groundedness, relevance, and length.\n \nThe full recording is here, \n\nCheck the next sessions here: .NET Live. \n \nBest,\nBruno", "hash": "9d21fa6b8849f7f9aee7105c2c9ba870e47655c794274469099da870e8605fc9", "id": "b12db0d2-e855-4cad-9b62-0c57b14c2dcf", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/ai-and-net-exploring-the-ai-samples-repo-and-the-model/ba-p/4137043", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-14T09:00:00", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "cbe30d20-c380-40f0-bf41-3ca471a5f756", "title": "AI and .NET: Exploring the AI samples repo and the model evaluation sample"}], "tags": {"Build 2024": {"name": "Build 2024", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "AI and .NET: Exploring the AI samples repo and the model evaluation sample"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T17:21:20.302036", "id": "cb1d85ca-fd97-4023-a8dc-c45d80d5cc7e", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-14T08:59:24", "id": "cfaecb54-d00e-4962-ae79-46f6271747f7", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Der Elektroautohersteller Tesla hat Ende April \u00fcberraschend einen personellen Kahlschlag durchgef\u00fchrt.

Repos scheinen es Hackern leichtzumachen.\nDie Attacken auf Repositories haben in der Entwicklercommunity f\u00fcr Open-Source-Projekte f\u00fcr Aufregung gesorgt: Zuerst der sehr bedrohliche auf die XZ-Tools, der fast die Sicherheit von SSH gef\u00e4hrdet h\u00e4tte, und zuletzt der auf Docker Hub, den die Firma JFrog aufgedeckt hat. Wir sprechen mit Sharchar Menashe, Senior Director von JFrog Security Research, dar\u00fcber, wie sicher Repositories und das Software-Deployment noch sind.\nWas macht Repositories f\u00fcr die Angreifer so interessant?\nZun\u00e4chst einmal denke ich, dass sich der XZ-Angriff erheblich von dem auf Docker Hub unterscheidet. Beim XZ-Angriff f\u00fchrte der Angreifer \"Jia Tan\" eine mehrj\u00e4hrige Social-Engineering-Kampagne durch, um das Vertrauen der XZ-Maintainer zu gewinnen. Das erm\u00f6glichte es ihm schlie\u00dflich, beliebige \u00c4nderungen am XZ-Projekt vorzunehmen. Ich w\u00fcrde daher sagen, dass dabei nicht GitHub angegriffen wurde, sondern vielmehr die Projektbetreuer. Der XZ-Code wurde zwar zuf\u00e4llig auf GitHub gehostet, das ist f\u00fcr den Angriff aber unerheblich.\nDie Angriffskampagne auf Docker Hub \u00e4hnelt denen mit b\u00f6sartigen Paketen in npm, PyPI und in geringerem Ma\u00dfe NuGet. Angreifer zielen auf diese Repositories ab, weil:\nJeder kann beliebige Inhalte in Repositories hochladen.\n-\nDie vollst\u00e4ndige Moderation der hochgeladenen Inhalte stellt eine fast unm\u00f6gliche Aufgabe dar (selbst bei Verwendung automatischer Moderationswerkzeuge).\n-\nIm Falle von npm und PyPI f\u00fchrt die Installation des falschen Pakets sofort zu einer uneingeschr\u00e4nkten Codeausf\u00fchrung \u2013 im Grunde die schlimmste, vorstellbare Auswirkung. Im Falle von Docker Hub ist die Codeausf\u00fchrung auf einen Container eingeschr\u00e4nkt, es sei denn, das Opfer wird dazu verleitet, Bin\u00e4rdateien au\u00dferhalb des Containers auszuf\u00fchren, was bei dem von uns entdeckten \"imagin\u00e4ren\" Angriff der Fall ist.\n-\nDer Angriff ist extrem einfach auszuf\u00fchren. F\u00fcr simple Angriffe (z. B. Typosquatting) muss der Angreifer nichts recherchieren, sondern nur b\u00f6sartige Inhalte in das Repository hochladen.\n-\nMillionen von Entwicklern und CI/CD-Maschinen nutzen Repositories t\u00e4glich, sodass das Verbreitungspotenzial der Malware sehr hoch ist.\n-\nWas f\u00fcr eine Auswirkung haben diese Angriffe auf die offene Art und Weise, wie Software (insbesondere Open Source) heutzutage entwickelt und bereitgestellt wird?\nDiese Angriffe haben meiner Meinung nach keinen wirklichen Einfluss auf die Entwicklung von OSS. Aber in Bezug auf Erstellung und Deployment sehen wir, dass Standards und Frameworks wie Google SLSA immer wichtiger werden. Die sorgen daf\u00fcr, dass die Software nach ihrer Entwicklung sicher erstellt und deployt wird, um so Angriffe auf die Lieferkette zu verhindern (z. B. soll sie nur auf einem sauberen, externen Rechner erstellt und mit einer Signatur/Attestierung bereitgestellt werden, die der Endbenutzer \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen kann).\nAlle Angriffe dieser Art hatten einen starken menschlichen Faktor, der sich nicht so einfach mit technischen Methoden aufdecken l\u00e4sst. Welche M\u00f6glichkeiten gibt es, Repositories und deren Nutzer besser zu sch\u00fctzen?\nIch denke, dass Angreifer in einem offenen Repository immer Wege finden, b\u00f6sartigen Code hochzuladen (selbst wenn dieser Code nach einer Weile wieder verschwindet), da eine hundertprozentige Moderation unm\u00f6glich ist. Die gr\u00f6\u00dften Repositories sollten eine architektonische \u00c4nderung vornehmen, um Aktionen, die ein Paket bei der Installation ausf\u00fchren kann, zu begrenzen. Wenn Anwender zum Beispiel ein Python-Paket mit pip installieren, sollte es standardm\u00e4\u00dfig keine M\u00f6glichkeit geben, beliebigen Code auszuf\u00fchren. Vielmehr sollten nur begrenzte Aktionen erlaubt sein, und das Ausf\u00fchren einer unsignierten Bin\u00e4rdatei sollte eine Warnmeldung ausl\u00f6sen.\nIn Docker Hub wird das Problem etwas entsch\u00e4rft, da der b\u00f6sartige Code nur innerhalb eines Containers ausgef\u00fchrt wird. Es besteht aber die Gefahr, dass Container manipuliert werden. Und es gibt b\u00f6sartige Nutzlasten, die auch dann sch\u00e4dlich sind, wenn sie nur innerhalb eines Containers laufen, beispielsweise Cryptominer.\nDar\u00fcber hinaus sollten Benutzer und Unternehmen in ihrer Entwicklungs- und CI/CD-Umgebung automatisierte Tools einsetzen, um sicherzustellen, dass die verwendeten Pakete nicht b\u00f6sartig sind.\nSharchar Menashe, vielen Dank f\u00fcr die Antworten!\nIn der Serie \"Drei Fragen und Antworten\" will die iX die heutigen Herausforderungen der IT auf den Punkt bringen \u2013 egal ob es sich um den Blick des Anwenders vorm PC, die Sicht des Managers oder den Alltag eines Administrators handelt.

So, how hard can it be to make a high-power resistor? In the video below, he examines a commercial power resistor and how to make your own using nichrome wire.\nSure, in theory, you can use a long piece of wire, but normally, you want to minimize the amount of space occupied. This leads to winding the wire around some substrate. If you just wind the wire, though, you get an inductor. This can cause nasty voltage spikes when there is a change in current through the resistor. You can get \u201cnoninductive\u201d wire wound resistors that use either two opposing windings or alternate the turn direction on each turn. This causes the magnetic fields to tend to cancel out, reducing the overall inductance.\nNichrome wire has more resistance per millimeter and can dissipate more power. Modern digital meters can measure the resistance of a wire if you account for the test leads. To make a substrate, [Electronoobs] got creative since he anticipated generating a lot of heat. The final product even uses water cooling.\nWhy do you want a big resistor? Maybe you need a dummy load, or you want to drain some batteries. If you want to recycle nichrome wire, it is much more common than you might expect.\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Regulators accused the company of misleading them about the nature and severity of the incident, in which a pedestrian was dragged over 20 feet by a driverless Cruise after first being struck by a hit-and-run driver.\nSeveral top executives have since left the company, including founder and CEO Kyle Vogt, and around a quarter of employees were laid off. GM has said it will reduce its spending on Cruise.

Anbieter Sonos hat wohl am 7. Mai 2024 ein Update seiner Lautsprecher-Software vorgenommen. Die Entwickler haben der App vermeintlich coole neue Funktionen spendiert und glaubten, gleich alte Z\u00f6pfe mit abschneiden zu k\u00f6nnen. Das kommt bei den Nutzern der Sonos-App nicht wirklich gut an. Ein Sturm der Entr\u00fcstung ist \u00fcber das Unternehmen hereingebrochen. Nun will Sonos ein Update vom Update herausbringen, welches dann einige der entfallenen Funktionen zur\u00fcck bringt. Gut gedacht ist nicht immer gut gemacht.\nAnzeige\nWas ist Sonos?\nSonos ist ein US-Hersteller von Audio-Unterhaltungselektronik mit Sitz in Santa Barbara, Kalifornien. Das Unternehmen entwickelt und produziert aktive Lautsprechersysteme und Hifi-Komponenten, die drahtlos \u00fcber WLAN miteinander vernetzt sind. Das System kann lokale Audiodateien oder Musikstreamingdienste nutzen und diese in mehreren R\u00e4umen gleichzeitig wiedergeben.\nGesteuert wird das Audiosystem mit einer App auf dem Smartphone, Tablet- oder Desktop-Computer, sowie zum Teil per Sprachsteuerung. Die Sonos-App \"vereint all deine Inhalte und Einstellungen an einem Ort \u2013 f\u00fcr eine einfache Steuerung deiner Sonos Produkte und Sound Experience.\" so der Hersteller auf seiner App-Seite. Der Zugriff auf Lieblingsinhalt soll einfach per Fingertipp m\u00f6glich sein.\nEin App-Update mit Folgen\nMit dem App-Update vom 7. Mai 2024 hat Sonos aber einige Funktionen wie die Wiedergabe lokaler Musik entfernt oder Features stark beschnitten. Auf X, Reddit, Facebook gab es seit dem m\u00e4chtig Kritik. Nachfolgender Tweet bringt das Ganze auf den Punkt.\nSpiegel Online hat das Ganze in diesem Artikel aufgegriffen und schreibt, dass manche Funktion komplett fehlen, andere seien stark beschnitten. Beim App-Update stand wohl Streaming im Vordergrund, w\u00e4hrend die Nutzer, die Musik von lokalen Quellen auf den Lautsprechern wiedergeben m\u00f6chten, \"in die R\u00f6hre schauen\". So seit die M\u00f6glichkeit \"Musik statt von Streamingdiensten von lokal vernetzten Speichermedien abzuspielen, bis zur Unbenutzbarkeit eingeschr\u00e4nkt worden\", hei\u00dfte es . Features wie die App als Wecker zu verwenden, ein Einschlaf-Timer sind \"geschlachtet worden\". Menschen, die assistive Unterst\u00fctzung ben\u00f6tigen (z.B. wegen reduzierter Sehf\u00e4higkeit) werden g\u00e4nzlich im Regen stehen gelassen.\nSonos hat dann vorige Woche eine Stellungnahme gegen\u00fcber The Verge abgegeben, das Unternehmen habe geh\u00f6rt, was die Kunden sagen. Aber das Update der App sei notwendig gewesen, auch wenn die App wegen fehlender Funktionen vorerst \"ein paar Schritte zur\u00fcck\" sei. Man glaubt wohl, geniale Funktionen in Zukunft anbieten zu k\u00f6nnen. Mal sehen, was da so kommt \u2013 ich bin diesbez\u00fcglich \"blank\", nutze keine Sonos-Produkte. Am (heutigen) 14. Mai 2024 soll eine Diskussion in der Sonos-Community stattfinden, wo Nutzer ihre Stimme einbringen k\u00f6nnen.\nCookies blockieren entzieht uns die Finanzierung: Cookie-Einstellungen\nIch nutze Sonos Lautsprecher schon eine gef\u00fchlte Ewigkeit und man ging viele Kompromisse ein (Stichwort: Kontozwang oder Trennung in S1 und S2), die neue App ist allerdings wirklich eine Frechheit. Ich bin schon was \u00e4lter und vielleicht \"festgefahren\", aber von MEINEN gekauften Lautsprecher kann ich doch wohl erwarten, dass MEINE lokale Musik abgespielt werden kann. Das geht mit der neuen App nicht mehr, ich habe solch eine technische Abwertung der Hardware durch eine Software wirklich noch nie erlebt-es ist mir nicht mehr m\u00f6glich, meine eigene Musik zu h\u00f6ren. Gerade gelesen: Das \"darf\" ich dann im Juni wieder, da kommt die lokale Bibliothek zur\u00fcck. Unfassbar! Das ist eine Beschneidung der Kernfunktion. Ich habe mir die .apk der Version 16.1 heruntergeladen und diese manuell installiert und die automatischen Updates ausgeschaltet, bis die App irgendwie wieder klarkommt. Und schon kann ich mein Produkt wieder nutzen\u2026 .\nNat\u00fcrlich kann ich nicht einfach so mein ganzes Sonos-System tauschen \u2013 kostet ja auch nicht wenig. W\u00fcrde f\u00fcr mich Geld keine Rolle spielen, h\u00e4tte ich es bereits ersetzt, denn Sonos entwickelt schon l\u00e4ngst am Kunden vorbei.\n\"\u2026Beim App-Update stand wohl Streaming im Vordergrund, w\u00e4hrend die Nutzer, die Musik von lokalen Quellen auf den Lautsprechern wiedergeben m\u00f6chten, \"in die R\u00f6hre schauen\"\u2026\"\nDas d\u00fcrfte Absicht sein, um Streaming-Diensten ein wenig Geld in die Kasse zu sp\u00fclen, und selbst auch noch einen kleinen Kick-Back (Bestechungs-Geld) zu erhalten.\nAnalog Microsoft und der Abschaltung von Win 10 und Einf\u00fchrung von Win 11: Microsoft sorgt f\u00fcr die Computer-Industrie f\u00fcr Umsatz, und wird deswegen von der Computer-Industrie Geld erhalten.\nFalls man eine Fritte hat, kann man vermutlich zuhause den dortigen Medienserver als 'Streamingquelle' nutzen.\nGut ist das nicht. Unterwegs braucht man das Zeug auf dem Handy, und so muss man zwei Stellen verwalten.

The unit has a number of features you don\u2019t always see in homebrew radios. It covers the 80, 40, 30, 20, 17, 15, 12, and 10 meter bands. The receiver is a single-IF design with AGC. The transmitter provides up to 10W for CW and 5W for single sideband operations. There\u2019s a built-in keyer, too.

The transmit chain is straightforward. The receiver reuses many of the same filters.\nLike many projects these days, an attractive 3D-printed case gives the radio a polished look. If you prefer using a straight key to a keyer, the transmitter will use either. The microphone amplifier has built-in compression for good audio levels.\nIf you don\u2019t want to roll your own, you can get similar ham gear that is ready-built.

It signals that the holder has experience, knowledge, and a strong command of the eight domains covered in the exam, related to information security, risk management, and asset protection from a management point of view.\nAs a Director of Governance, Risk, and Compliance advisory at Infoedge, I know I can apply my CISSP knowledge to deliver value for our clients.\nIt\u2019s rumored the CISSP examp pass rate is about 20%. I scheduled my exam for the spring of 2024, and I have set aside precisely six weeks to prepare for it. Here\u2019s what I did in anticipation of the exam.\nBaseline your knowledge\nIt may seem trite, but take an Udemy or Coursera class. Or, if you have the time and discipline, read the entire Body of Knowledge textbook. Even if you\u2019re an expert on Asset Security, this ensures you\u2019re comprehensive and close knowledge gaps because very few individuals are experts in all the domains covered by the CISSP exam.\nYouTube is your friend\nThere is a wealth of very credible material online, especially on YouTube. Augment your baseline with material such as Destination Cert\u2019s Mind Map Series and Pete Zerger\u2019s 8-hour-long exam cram video. Review this to take note of weaknesses, fill in knowledge gaps and expand on your comfort areas.\nGet in the mindset\nExam-taking is a skill that can be learned. Knowing the exam is half the battle, but it\u2019s important to understand the types of questions you can expect and have a tactic for each. Andrew Ramadahl\u2019s \u201c50 CISSP\u201d questions and Kelly Handerhahn\u2019s \u201cWhy you will pass the CISSP\u201d are solid mindset tools to align your thought process to how the ISC2 likes to challenge test takers.\nPractice, practice, practice\nAfter four weeks of vacuuming up as much material as possible, I set aside the final two weeks for test-taking tactics. As someone who used to compete in Judo and similar sports, it\u2019s important to \u201cpeak\u201d at the right time just like an athlete. It\u2019s not just about good test-taking tactics, but also exam \u201cstamina\u201d so you can be prepared to sit from between 1.5 hours to 4 hours. Practice tests also expose weaknesses, so you can go back and drill some more or apply different memorization and mnemonic techniques.\nThe exam experience\nThe CISSP is a computerized adaptive test, which adapts to your performance. While it\u2019s impossible to know if you\u2019re doing well or not, I would recommend test takers not focus on that since some questions are even experimental and are simply not counted. Instead, focus on being disciplined on eliminating bad answers and managing your time well (around 1 minute 30 seconds is the general recommended average per question).\nConsistency is king. From my experience the first 50-60 questions were a mix of difficult and relatively easy questions. But as time progressed, the questions became incrementally harder and harder until I hit the hardest question at two hours which happened to be 136. When I selected the answer and pressed submit, there was a pause of what felt like several minutes.\nSuddenly the exam stopped. I was expecting the full 175 questions and four hours, so when I walked up to the proctor, and I received a single white sheet of paper that said \u201cCongratulations,\u201d I was truly elated.\nReflection\nWhile my exam experience as a consultant with a focus on GRC is somewhat unique, this background was most definitely an asset. The exam challenges test takers to think like a senior executive rather than a network engineer or sysadmin. This is the key to answering questions correctly for this exam \u2013 making decisions from the standpoint of an executive.\nOverall, while the CISSP is a tremendous accomplishment, it is by no means a substitute for skills, knowledge and experience. Still, it signals a very high standard of professionalism. In fact the actual process of studying for the exam is just as invaluable in itself. In my case, it made me a more comprehensive professional by providing context on areas such as physical security and encryption techniques.\nWhile I would certainly not recommend giving yourself six weeks, the process of internalizing the knowledge from all 8 security domains and the implicit time pressure helped add a great deal of breadth to my existing knowledge and validated the depth of my experience. Furthermore, I know I will be able to directly apply the overall experience directly towards helping clients and organizations at Infoedge and beyond.\nFill out the form to get your guide:", "hash": "43afe0a4c5dc91e8d726a61afb06e736ad6b5cf873c354850cb6655d461bc7c3", "id": "4bcf24c7-1fc0-4421-a976-b5b1b0306723", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/05/14/cissp-exam-experience/", "osint_source_id": "c5bebd4b-5715-4589-a65c-0344a226ab6f", "published": "2024-05-14T04:55:18", "source": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/feed", "story_id": "2a225bf7-7099-4d4d-b6b0-8f2084943467", "title": "How a GRC consultant passed the CISSP exam in six weeks"}], "tags": {"Andrew Ramadahl": {"name": "Andrew Ramadahl", "tag_type": "PER"}, "CISSP": {"name": "CISSP", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "GRC": {"name": "GRC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Judo": {"name": "Judo", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Kelly Handerhahn": {"name": "Kelly Handerhahn", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Pete Zerger": {"name": "Pete Zerger", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Udemy": {"name": "Udemy", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "How a GRC consultant passed the CISSP exam in six weeks"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T09:14:34.858632", "id": "e8933d77-4c81-4df1-9cce-999620c5628c", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-14T04:35:11", "id": "d8cf54c0-1e68-4df8-b4d9-94500e3482b3", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Da ist es also, das neue iPad Pro. \"Unglaublich, sooo d\u00fcnn!\", war letzte Woche bei der Premiere in London mantraartig an allen Ecken und Enden der Veranstaltung zu h\u00f6ren.

Therefore, step one defines what responsible AI means for your business. Consider the risks your business faces, regulatory and industry standards you must comply with, and whether you are a provider of AI, consumer of AI, or both. For example, a healthcare organization\u2019s definition of responsible AI will likely prioritize data privacy and HIPAA compliance.\nFrom there, use your definition of responsible AI to determine a set of principles that will guide your AI development and use. Then, determine how you will put your AI principles into practice. For example, if one of your principles is to ensure your AI systems are understandable, your team could build your AI tools to show their work and make it easy for customers to understand exactly how an AI tool arrived at an answer or insight.\nThroughout this process, it\u2019s a best practice to be transparent with your employees, customers, and partners. This includes:\nPublicly sharing your AI principles\n-\nAcknowledging the challenges you expect to encounter as you develop your AI systems\n-\nTraining your employees how to comply with the principles and use AI in a responsible way\n-\nPublicly sharing exactly how your company\u2019s AI systems work\n-\nOnce you\u2019ve taken these steps, you can start aligning AI with products and services to drive better results responsibly.\nConsidering the increasing integration of AI in cybersecurity, what are the most effective strategies for enhancing digital security against AI-driven threats?\nThis is a moving target right now because AI is developing at such a rapid pace. For example, when generative AI tools like ChatGPT launched, phishing emails suddenly became much more sophisticated. We started seeing tailored phishing emails with perfect grammar that didn\u2019t have some of the telltale signs we train our employees to look for.\nThe evolving nature of AI-driven threats makes them challenging to defend against. It\u2019s also important to be aware that while AI can be used to benefit organizations, others will seek to abuse it. Security, IT, and governance teams, in particular, must anticipate how AI abuse can impact their organizations.\nOne effective strategy for defending against AI-driven threats is ongoing skilling and training for employees to better recognize and report new security threats. When my team noticed phishing emails were becoming more sophisticated, we notified our employees and evolved our phishing simulation tests accordingly. We also added a phish reporting button to the sidebar of our employees\u2019 inboxes so they can report potential phishing emails with just two clicks.\nWhat role does AI play in crisis management, and how can organizations better prepare for AI-related failures or breaches?\nAs AI becomes increasingly embedded in business operations, organizations must ask themselves how to prepare for and prevent AI-related failures, such as AI-powered data breaches. AI tools are enabling hackers to develop highly effective social engineering attacks. Right now, having a strong foundation in place to protect customer data is a good place to start. Ensuring third-party AI model providers don\u2019t use your customers\u2019 data also adds protection and control.\nThere are also opportunities for AI to help strengthen crisis management. The first relates to security crises, such as outages and failures, where AI can identify the root of an issue faster. AI can quickly sift through a ton of data to find the \u201cneedle in the haystack\u201d that points to the source of the attack or the service that failed. It can also surface relevant data for you much faster using conversational prompts. In the future, an analyst might be able to ask an AI chatbot that\u2019s embedded in its security framework questions about suspicious activity, such as, \u201cWhat can you tell me about where this traffic originated from?\u201d Or, \u201cWhat kind of host was this on?\u201d\nThere is also an opportunity for AI to help manage public crises. For example, during a natural disaster, AI could help response teams more easily coordinate with each other and manage requests for help.\nWith AI\u2019s decision-making processes often opaque, what steps can organizations take to increase transparency and ensure accountability when AI systems go wrong?\nOne of the most important steps is publicly documenting how your AI systems work, including how you use public models and protect data. Encourage your team to get as specific as possible and go the extra mile to explain how everything works in detail. Since generative AI is still relatively new and evolving, I like to take a scientific approach to this process, including documenting the facts we know today, what we expect in the future, and the subsequent outcomes.\nIf you\u2019re developing AI systems, it\u2019s also important that the tools you\u2019re building show their work so your customers understand the recommendations and insights AI provides. As AI becomes more integrated into our everyday work, explaining its reasoning will be crucial for maintaining customer trust.\nHow do you anticipate AI governance evolving, and what are the key challenges and opportunities you foresee?\nAI has huge potential to strengthen data security and add an extra layer of protection. Nobody can manually monitor all the data flowing through their business; intelligent systems must take on that burden. AI can grow to \u201cunderstand\u201d what\u2019s normal and flag anything that isn\u2019t. This has the potential to greatly increase response rates and standardize processes.\nOne of the biggest governance challenges is the pace at which AI is being adopted and implemented. Organizations are moving quickly to adopt AI, and some are skipping the important steps of informing their customers how they\u2019re integrating AI and allowing them to opt-out. This puts an extra burden on security teams to ensure their vendors are not using AI without their knowledge.", "hash": "de229aa0a42656d5ce1764398ab4cfa43456eef2c5ea9e607e2b50392f75e31c", "id": "29b838b1-eb84-447f-97ec-f4ffb934eb7d", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/05/14/chris-peake-smartsheet-responsible-ai/", "osint_source_id": "c5bebd4b-5715-4589-a65c-0344a226ab6f", "published": "2024-05-14T04:00:55", "source": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/feed", "story_id": "dfdf9251-9f3d-421e-938c-a99a5d2d6bfd", "title": "Tailoring responsible AI: Defining ethical guidelines for industry-specific use"}], "tags": {"AI-driven": {"name": "AI-driven", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "AI-powered": {"name": "AI-powered", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ChatGPT": {"name": "ChatGPT", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Chris Peake": {"name": "Chris Peake", "tag_type": "PER"}, "HIPAA": {"name": "HIPAA", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Peake": {"name": "Peake", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Smartsheet": {"name": "Smartsheet", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "phishing": {"name": "phishing", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Tailoring responsible AI: Defining ethical guidelines for industry-specific use"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-14T09:12:51.021466", "id": "109c6e7c-1eba-46ca-b6a5-f8c4b88a549d", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "15"}, {"created": "2024-05-14T09:08:37.844667", "id": "af3b4802-217b-450c-978e-0793a0223d26", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-14T04:00:00", "id": "be2e8f04-1cd3-4975-a85f-3fb7ec82add1", "news_items": [{"author": "david.kotrba@futurezone.at (David Kotrba)", "content": "\"Musk hat Angst vor China\u201c: Ungewisse Zukunft f\u00fcr Supercharger\nDie Entscheidungen von Multimilliard\u00e4r Elon Musk waren f\u00fcr Au\u00dfenstehende schon \u00f6fters r\u00e4tselhaft.

(wired.com) 45\nAn anonymous reader quotes a report from Wired: On a side street outside the headquarters of the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology in the center of London on Monday, 20 or so protesters are getting their chants in order. \"What do we want? Safe AI! When do we want it?\" The protesters hesitate. \"Later?\" someone offers. The group of mostly young men huddle for a moment before breaking into a new chant. \"What do we want? Pause AI! When do we want it? Now!\" These protesters are part of Pause AI, a group of activists petitioning for companies to pause development of large AI models which they fear could pose a risk to the future of humanity. Other PauseAI protests are taking place across the globe: In San Francisco, New York, Berlin, Rome, Ottawa, and ahandful of other cities. Their aim is to grab the attention of voters and politicians ahead of the AI Seoul Summit -- a follow-up to the AI Safety Summit held in the UK in November 2023. But the loosely organized group of protesters itself is still figuring out exactly the best way to communicate its message.\n\"The Summit didn't actually lead to meaningful regulations,\" says Joep Meindertsma, the founder of PauseAI. The attendees at the conference agreed to the \"Bletchley Declaration,\" but that agreement doesn't mean much, Meindertsma says. \"It's only a small first step, and what we need are binding international treaties.\" [...] There is also the question of how PauseAI should achieve its aims. On the group's Discord, some members discussed the idea of staging sit-ins at the headquarters of AI developers. OpenAI, in particular, has become a focal point of AI protests. In February, Pause AI protests gathered in front of OpenAI'sSan Francisco offices, after the company changed its usage policies to remove a ban on military and warfare applications for its products. Would it be too disruptive if protests staged sit-ins or chained themselves to the doors of AI developers, one member of the Discord asked. \"Probably not. We do what we have to, in the end, for a future with humanity, while we still can.\" [...]\nDirector of Pause AI US, Holly Elmore, wants the movement to be a \"broad church\" that includes artists, writers, and copyright owners whose livelihoods are put at risk from AI systems that can mimic creative works. \"I'm a utilitarian. I'm thinking about the consequences ultimately, but the injustice that really drives me to do this kind of activism is the lack of consent\" from companies producing AI models, she says. \"We don't have to choose which AI harm is the most important when we're talking about pausing as a solution. Pause is the only solution that addresses all of them.\" [Joseph Miller, the organizer of PauseAI's protest in London] echoed this point. He says he's spoken to artists whose livelihoods have been impacted by the growth of AI art generators. \"These are problems that are real today, and are signs of much more dangerous things to come.\" One of the London protesters, Gideon Futerman, has a stack of leaflets he's attempting to hand out to civil servants leaving the building opposite. He has been protesting with the group since last year. \"The idea of a pause being possible has really taken root since then,\" he says. According to Wired, the leaders of Pause AI said they were not considering sit-ins or encampments near AI offices at this time. \"Our tactics and our methods are actually very moderate,\" says Elmore. \"I want to be the moderate base for a lot of organizations in this space. I'm sure we would never condone violence. I also want Pause AI to go further than that and just be very trustworthy.\"\nMeindertsma agrees, saying that more disruptive action isn't justified at the moment. \"I truly hope that we don't need to take other actions. I don't expect that we'll need to. I don't feel like I'm the type of person to lead a movement that isn't completely legal.\"\nSlashdotters, what is the most effective way to protest AI development?

Filings to anti-fraud non-profit Cifas would support that claim, as Insider Threat Database (ITD) reports rose by 14% this past year and are largely attributable to hard-to-monitor work-from-home employees mixed with \u201cincreasing financial pressures.\u201d The report details further incidents of dishonest behavior as recorded this year by the UK\u2019s National Fraud Database (NFD).\nInsider Threats on the Rise\nOver 300 individuals were reported to the IDT in 2023. The most common cause? Dishonest action to obtain benefit by theft or deception. This type of fraud now represents nearly half (49%) of all reported insider incidents, up ten percent from last year.\nCifas notes that the ongoing cost-of-living crisis could be a contributing factor, as more desperate times are tempting workers who would otherwise not consider dishonest actions.\nThe second-most common cause of insider deceit is false employment application. This is when an organization falsifies the number, type, or existence of employees to gain some type of benefit like a tax break, minority hiring incentive, fraudulent worker\u2019s compensation claim, or even maternity benefit. With not enough boots on the ground to investigate and verify each \u201cemployee,\u201d this type of case can be difficult to track. A full one-third (33%) of all internal fraud cases are linked to this type of act.\nThe good news is that the number of cases caught through internal controls is up by 20%, indicating a positive rise in company-based monitoring. However, the total number caught in this way still equals less than six out of every ten instances.\nInterestingly, the data revealed most of those caught in fraudulent activity had been in their position for less than a year. The numbers shot up from 21% last year to 38% this. This rise could be due to a combination of factors: lack of loyalty to a still-new employer, the fact that controls are simply better at catching incidents than they were in the past, or the phenomenon of more experienced employees simply knowing better ways to hide.\nHow long an employee had been in their position continued to be a determining factor in other crimes:\nAccount misconduct | 64% of account misconduct incidents came from those employed for one year or less.\n-\nBribery | 80% taken by bribery had been employed for over a decade. This could possibly be because threat actors find those with the most experience the most valuable targets for information worth paying for.\n-\nUnlawful disclosure of commercial data | 75% of those caught stealing company secrets had been employed for under five years.\n-\nOther Instances of Fraud\nThere were more than just insider threats reported to Cifas in 2023. Other cases of fraud included:\nMisuse of facility | This is where \u201can account or other facility is obtained, with the deliberate intent of using that facility for a fraudulent purpose.\u201d Fraud in this area was seen primarily in loan products (+82%), asset finance (45%), and plastic cards (17%) - all ways of obtaining credit. Notably, the increase in new (and fraudulent) loan products was connected with a widespread evasion of payment on current loans issued under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS).\nIdentity fraud | While overall rates were down (-14%), bank accounts saw a 12% increase in identity fraud, particularly personal accounts. Persons over the age of 61 years continue to be the primary targets (24%), followed by those between the ages of 51-60 years (21%), and the most common tactic of choice continues to be impersonation involving a current address (77% of all identity fraud cases).\nFacility takeover | Facility takeover occurs when a legitimate account is compromised by a threat actor who impersonates the actual owner, gains control of the account and makes unauthorized transactions. This past year saw a 13% increase overall in this department, attributed largely to a massive 59% increase in the telecommunications sector. Telecoms now account for 41% of all facility takeover filings as cybercriminals increasingly use mobile phones as a vehicle for account takeover instead of the (potentially more difficult) identity fraud tactic used in previous years.\nCauses of Workplace Dishonestly\nCifas offers several explanations for the increase in employee fraud rates.\nAI-powered fraud (such as word-perfect phishing campaigns) makes it easier to deceive users and more difficult to detect a fake.\n-\nSocial media opens up numerous avenues for deceit, account hacking, and communication that can lead to recruitment for fraudulent activities.\n-\nThe cost-of-living crisis puts individuals in a vulnerable position in which they are more likely to take a chance on a risky \u201cinvestment scheme\u201d or blatantly fraudulent act.\n-\nThese factors, combined with the increase in remote work, make day-to-day activities more difficult to monitor and instances of dishonesty more challenging to detect. Regulations across the UK are springing up in response to the rise in fraud; they include the Online Safety Act, the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (ECCTA), and a mandatory reimbursement requirement for Authorized Push Payment (APP) fraud.

Before this, only AMD's Frontier system had been able to achieve this level of performance. Intel also achieved what it says is the world's best performance for AI at 10.61 \"AI exaflops.\" Intel reported the news on its blog, stating Aurora was now officially the fastest supercomputer for AI in the world. It shares the distinction in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which both built and houses the system in its current state, which Intel says was at 87% functionality for the recent tests. In the all-important Linpack (HPL) test, the Aurora computer hit 1.012 exaflops, meaning it has almost doubled the performance on tap since its initial \"partial run\" in late 2023, where it hit just 585.34 petaflops. The company then said it expected to cross the exascale barrier with Aurora eventually, and now it has.\nIntel says for the ISC 2024 tests, Aurora was operating with 9,234 nodes. The company notes it ranked second overall in LINPACK, meaning it's still unable to dethrone AMD's Frontier system, which is also an HPE supercomputer. AMD's Frontier was the first supercomputer to break the exascale barrier in June 2022. Frontier sits at around 1.2 exaflops in Linpack, so Intel is knocking on its door but still has a way to go before it can topple it. However, Intel says Aurora came in first in the Linpack-mixed benchmark, reportedly highlighting its unparalleled AI performance. Intel's Aurora supercomputer uses the company's latest CPU and GPU hardware, with 21,248 Sapphire Rapids Xeon CPUs and 63,744 Ponte Vecchio GPUs. When it's fully operational later this year, Intel believes the system will eventually be capable of crossing the 2-exaflop barrier.\nIntel says for the ISC 2024 tests, Aurora was operating with 9,234 nodes.

Yet this is now at risk as US astronomers are forced to choose between funding either the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) or the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) as part of the US Extremely Large Telescope (USELT) program. This rightfully has the presidents of Carnegie Science and Caltech \u2013 [Eric D. Isaacs] and [Thomas F. Rosenbaum] respectively \u2013 upset, with their opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times going over all the reasons why this funding cut is a terrible idea.\nThe slow death of US astronomy is perhaps best exemplified by the slow death and eventual collapse of the Arecibo radio telescope. Originally constructed as a Cold War era ICBM detector, it found grateful use by radio astronomers, but saw constant budget cuts and decommissioning threats. After Arecibo\u2019s collapse, it\u2019s now China with its FAST telescope that has mostly taken the limelight. In the case of optical telescopes, the EU\u2019s own ELT is expected to be online in 2028, sited close to the GMT in the Atacama desert. The TMT would be sited in Hawai\u2019i.\nOf note is also that the TMT and GMT are both not solely US-funded at this point in time, but rather a partnership with a range of other nations, including Australia, Chile, South Korea, China, Canada, Japan, India and others. Even if the US only contributes funds to either telescope, the other partners may decide to pick up the slack, however the TMT project is currently in dire straits as the selected site on Mauna Kea has run into severe local resistance. This may force the TMT project to be sited elsewhere.\nGMT and ESO\u2019s ELT would seem to overlap significantly in terms of functionality and observed parts of the sky, making the TMT perhaps the most useful choice for US astronomers if they cannot have both. No matter what choice is made, however, it\u2019ll mean more US budget cuts for astronomy and more US astronomers having to schedule observation time at EU and Asian observatories. Ultimately the USA as the guiding star in astronomy may significantly diminish, along with the positive effects of this status in the scientific community.\n8 thoughts on \u201cThe New Extremely Large Telescopes And The US\u2019 Waning Influence In Astronomy\u201d\nNow this is a bit weird. The Magellan is somewhere halfway construction, while the 30m is in some planning state. It seems unlikely that construction of the Magellan is being started before financing has been done, so I guess there is more going on here. It\u2019s speculation, but it\u2019s probably some kind of chess game to kick up some fuzz and get more funding.\nSo why is the US picking up the majority of the tab for a jointly funded project, and why does it matter if US astronomers need to pay/get time on other telescopes?\nThis article reads very much like spoiled kids who want the best toys, but doesn\u2019t lay out why the *need* them\nAs a taxpayer currently funding two foreign wars, cuts across the board are necessary.\nI don\u2019t know what to answer, but as a foreigner I\u2019m glad that such projects get public money.

This post will describe the infection flow of the DanaBot malware that is distributed through documents containing external links, the latter method, as well as the evidence and detection process with the AhnLab EDR product\u2019s diagram. Figure 1 shows the content of a spam email with a Word document attached that contains an external link. As you can see, it is a sophisticatedly disguised email pretending to be a job application form to deceive the recipient. The attached file (.docx) is a Word document that contains an external link.\nFigure 2 depicts the EDR evidence of the PC that opened the email and executed the attachment. The screen shows that a document file (.docx) was created and executed through the Outlook (outlook.exe) process. The diagram depicts suspicious process tree sequence starting from Outlook (outlook.exe), followed by Word (winword.exe), command prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell (powershell.exe), and then an executable file iu4t4.exe to rundll32.exe.\nFigure 3 shows the external link inside the attached Word file (.docx). Through this mechanism, executing the Word file (.docx) will connect to the specified address to download additional documents and load them. Figure 4 shows the macro document (w1p3nx.dotm) downloaded and loaded via the external connection upon opening the Word file (.docx). As shown in Figure 5, the EDR diagram confirms that the additional document (w1p3nx.dotm) is downloaded and loaded from the WINWORD.EXE process which runs the Word file.\nFigure 6 shows the macro code included in the additionally downloaded macro document (w1p4nx.dotm). The code decodes and executes the encoded CMD commands. The EDR diagram in Figure 7 confirms the existence of the decoded commands and reveals a PowerShell command to download the DanaBot malware (iu4t4.exe) from the C2.\nFigure 8 shows the DanaBot malware (iu4t4.exe) created in the download path (C:\\Users\\Public), while Figure 9 depicts evidence in the EDR diagram confirming the creation of DanaBot via PowerShell.\nFigure 10 shows how the executed DanaBot malware (iu4t4.exe) re-launches itself with shell32.dll\u2019s parameters through rundll32.exe. Therefore, it is operating within shell32.dll, the acting process being rundll32.exe.\nDanaBot malware [1] has the capabilities to steal various data from the PC upon infection and can collect information without being connected to the C2. The behavior evidence of rundll32.exe in the EDR diagram (see Figure 11) shows that the malware takes screenshots and collects PC information and browser account credentials.\nThis article described the infection flow of the DanaBot malware being spread via documents containing external links and its behavioral evidence tracked by the EDR product in a diagram. The attacker employed a document containing an external link to prevent their malicious macro from being detected in an attachment. The email distributing the malware is also sophisticatedly disguised as an ordinary job application form to deceive the recipient into opening the document. It is essential to exercise caution when opening attachments and ensure that there is no extension present that is capable of executing malware.

Threat actors can use these search engines to engage in malicious behaviors such as collecting information on attack targets or performing port scanning attacks against any devices. The threat actor utilizes the information collected to find weaknesses in the target system and attempt initial access. Ultimately, they are able to attain their goals such as lateral movement and distribution of ransomware. As such, corporate security administrators must practice persistent management and monitoring for abnormal behaviors if there are externally exposed IT assets.\nAhnLab Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a next-generation threat detection and response solution, providing powerful threat monitoring, analysis, and response capabilities for endpoint areas based on Korea\u2019s only self-behavior-based engine. AhnLab EDR continuously collects information related to suspicious behaviors based on each type, allowing users to precisely perceive threats from a detection, analysis, and response perspective. Users then can conduct comprehensive analysis based on the data to identify causes, respond with appropriate measures, and establish processes to prevent threat recurrence.\nThis post will cover how AhnLab EDR can be used to detect and respond to initial access to Windows Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers by threat actors.\n1. IIS Worker Process (w3wp.exe)\nThe w3wp.exe process is the worker process of the IIS web server. It is responsible for the actual features of the web server and launches the ASP.NET application. Generally, threat actors identify attack targets using network device search engines such as Shodan. When a web server with a vulnerable version is identified, they exploit a vulnerability appropriate for the version to install web shells or execute malicious commands.\nIn the ASEC Blog post \u201cCase of Malware Distribution Linking to Illegal Gambling Website Targeting Korean Web Server\u201d uploaded on May 8th, 2024, threat actors were shown to download the Meterpreter backdoor through normal Windows utilities (cmd and certutil). While no web shell detection logs could be found in the infected PC, it seems that the Meterpreter backdoor was executed via a web shell since cmd.exe was launched by the w3wp.exe process.\nConclusion\nThreat actors are attempting to initially access various externally exposed attack surfaces such as MS-SQL, Redis, MeshAgent, and Windows IIS. Because these attack surfaces can be looked up on network scan infrastructures such as Shodan, corporate security administrators must practice attack surface management to identify assets that can be exposed to threat actors and regularly apply security patches.\nAhnLab Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) and AhnLab Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) products prevent security incidents through automated patch management and allow administrators to practice secure integrated management and operation of corporate infrastructures by providing continuous monitoring of endpoints and server terminals as well as visibility of threats to endpoint environments.\nBehavior Detection\n\u2013 InitialAccess/DETECT.Event.M11451\n\u2013 Execution/DETECT.Behavior.M10699\nAhnLab EDR protects the endpoint environment by delivering behavioral detection, advanced analysis, holistic visibility, and proactive threat hunting.

Along with expanding production, the U.S. Department of Commerce said the funding would trigger additional private capital investment to \"transform Polar from a majority foreign-owned in-house manufacturer to a majority U.S.-owned commercial foundry, expanding opportunities for U.S. chip designers to innovate and produce technologies domestically.\" In other words - sure it'll expand the output, but the real win is another majority U.S.-owned foundry for the White House to tout.\nAccording to its website, Polar is currently owned by Korean conglomerate SK Group and serves as the primary fab and engineering center for Japanese firm Sanken Electric. Not exactly companies in countries with poor U.S. relations - but overseas owners, nonetheless. \"This proposed investment in Polar will crowd in private capital, which will help make Polar a U.S.-based, independent foundry,\" said U.S. Commerce secretary Gina Raimondo. \"They will be able to expand their customer base and create a stable domestic supply of critical chips, made in America's heartland.\"\nPolar, which manufactures semiconductors used primarily for the energy industry and electric vehicles, will use the funds to double its production capacity of sensor and power chips and upgrade its manufacturing kit, as well as adding 160 jobs to boot.

In short, IBM has gone to great lengths to avoid copyright or legal issues. The Granite Code Base models are trained on 3- to 4-terabyte tokens of code data and natural language code-related datasets. All these models are licensed under the Apache 2.0 license for research and commercial use. It's that last word -- commercial -- that stopped the other major LLMs from being open-sourced. No one else wanted to share their LLM goodies.\nBut, as IBM Research chief scientist Ruchir Puri said, \"We are transforming the generative AI landscape for software by releasing the highest performing, cost-efficient code LLMs, empowering the open community to innovate without restrictions.\" Without restrictions, perhaps, but not without specific applications in mind. The Granite models, as IBM ecosystem general manager Kate Woolley said last year, are not \"about trying to be everything to everybody. This is not about writing poems about your dog. This is about curated models that can be tuned and are very targeted for the business use cases we want the enterprise to use. Specifically, they're for programming.\"\nThese decoder-only models, trained on code from 116 programming languages, range from 3 to 34 billion parameters. They support many developer uses, from complex application modernization to on-device memory-constrained tasks. IBM has already used these LLMs internally in IBM Watsonx Code Assistant (WCA) products, such as WCA for Ansible Lightspeed for IT Automation and WCA for IBM Z for modernizing COBOL applications. Not everyone can afford Watsonx, but now, anyone can work with the Granite LLMs using IBM and Red Hat's InstructLab.\nBut, as IBM Research chief scientist Ruchir Puri said, \"We are transforming the generative AI landscape for software by releasing the highest performing, cost-efficient code LLMs, empowering the open community to innovate without restrictions.\" Without restrictions, perhaps, but not without specific applications in mind.
