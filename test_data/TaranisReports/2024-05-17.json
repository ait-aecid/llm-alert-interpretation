They remain at work, along with doctors and staff from separate medical missions, serving a population trapped in Gaza with no escape.\nThe missions, as is often the case, had been scheduled to last two weeks before a fresh group of aid workers would rotate in with new supplies. But after Israel seized and closed the Rafah border crossing into Egypt, nothing could get in or out, neither supplies nor people.\nAmong the three Americans who refused to leave is Adam Hamawy, a New Jersey doctor and Army veteran who insisted on remaining behind to protect and serve his patients.\n\u201cThere is a palpable gloom and foreboding that had set in at the hospital. The children and staff are asking for everyone by name. All the Americans and Brits left. That can\u2019t be a good sign,\u201d said Hamawy.\n\u201cA decision for some of us to stay was consistent with our American values. We came in as a team and we do not leave anyone behind. If all and only the Americans left at once, what would that say about us as a nation?\u201d\nWhile serving in the Iraq War, Hamawy was the doctor who treated now-Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., when her helicopter was shot down. Duckworth credits Hamawy for saving her life and put pressure on Israel and the State Department to find a way to free the medical workers.\nHamawy said that the mission staff had been put in an impossible position.\n\u201cAlthough we feel we are abandoning our patients we all understood that this was going to happen from day one,\u201d he said, given the short-term nature of the mission. \u201cWe would have to turn over our patients to a fresh team. Unfortunately we have to leave this burden on our overworked, burnt out Palestinian colleagues. The three Americans that stayed behind opened the opportunity for three Brits to leave.\u201d\nSixteen medical workers remain at the hospital, Hamawy said. That includes nationals of Egypt, Ireland, Australia, and Jordan \u2014 countries with less political sway than the United States. Other missions, some staffed with Americans, remain active elsewhere in Gaza.\nThe staff and patients fear that without Americans in the hospital to serve as political shields against the Israel Defense Forces, the hospital will be destroyed, as the IDF has done to every other hospital in Gaza.\n\u201cIt was a grueling trip and very bitter departure,\u201d said Monica Johnston, a nurse who initially held out against leaving without new aid worker replacements but eventually agreed to go. \u201cThe politics and injustice in it enrages me.\u201d Johnston said the bombing around the hospital had ramped up in recent days.\nRotating in a new mission has taken on additional importance given the blockade of medical supplies, as each new mission arrives with their own supplies. \u201cThe refusal to allow in basic humanitarian aid,\u201d said Hamawy, \u201cis a failure of the international community.\u201d\nDr. Mosab Nasser, who led the FAJR Scientific mission to the hospital, took a more upbeat approach in a statement issued after he arrived safely in Jerusalem. \u201cI am thrilled to announce that the FAJR team (comprising 12 Americans and 3 British nationals) has been successfully picked up by both the US and UK embassies from the KS crossing near Gaza,\u201d Nasser wrote, going on to reference Hamawy and another volunteer. \u201cThe team will spend a day in Jerusalem before flying back to the US and UK on Sunday. Two of our FAJR volunteers have remained in Gaza, continuing their life-saving work. They will soon exit Gaza as part of the UN rotation of EMTs, in collaboration with the WHO.\u201d (The third American to stay behind was part of a separate mission, as was Johnston, at the same hospital.)\n\u201cThis achievement highlights the remarkable coordination FAJR Scientific has accomplished with international entities, including the Department of State, the US embassy in Jerusalem and Cairo, the UK embassy in Tel Aviv, the US embassy in Muscat, Oman, the WHO, OCHA, CLA, and others,\u201d he went on. \u201cYes, we left Gaza, but Gaza has left an indelible mark on us, and it will remain with us forever. We promise we will be back again and very soon.\u201d\nThe statement rankled some staff who stayed behind there and at other medical facilities.\nDorotea Gucciardo, an aid worker in Rafah with the medical solidarity organization Glia Equal Care, said that the international focus on Western doctors risked obscuring the reason they are there: Israel\u2019s ongoing occupation and assault on Gaza. \u201cWe have international organizations, we have national governments all working together to open the borders for this already privileged group of people,\u201d she said. \u201cOur main objective is not that we are stuck here and we need to get out. Our main objective is to ensure that the patients are being taken care of. I think that the focus should be put back onto once again the reason why these humanitarian workers are here to begin with, and that\u2019s the occupation. And this ongoing siege and war against Gaza.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing some international aid workers saying, \u2018Oh, it can\u2019t get worse than this,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet, if we actually take a look at context and if we take a look at history, we see that it can get worse. It has gotten worse and it\u2019s continuing to get worse. And so we can do the best that we can while we are here to support our Gazan hosts and our colleagues. But what we need is for this war to end. We need this siege to end, this blockade to end, the occupation to end, so that we can finally have aid too.\u201d\nDr. Haleh Sheikholesami, an American physician from California also volunteering with Glia, said the situation put the perilous prospects of the Palestinians in stark relief: \u201cYou know that hopefully this will end and we can go home. But, unfortunately, the Gazans don\u2019t have such predictions.\u201d", "hash": "be016080a23a4dd76f357927611d46d2e32fd9a79a33a761ff654bbaa4c6a1dd", "id": "89dd625f-197f-417e-9b95-d243c351db05", "link": "https://theintercept.com/2024/05/17/gaza-american-doctors-evacuated/", "osint_source_id": "a87d9c83-841f-455b-9e28-f8d5df3a6fb5", "published": "2024-05-17T23:47:13", "source": "https://theintercept.com/feed/?rss", "story_id": "da873627-70a4-4a38-b1cc-d211e84ed131", "title": "Medical Workers Evacuated From Gaza, but 3 Americans Refuse to Leave"}], "tags": {"Adam Hamawy": {"name": "Adam Hamawy", "tag_type": "PER"}, "American": {"name": "American", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Americans": {"name": "Americans", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Australia": {"name": "Australia", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Bitter": {"name": "Bitter", "tag_type": "APT"}, "British": {"name": "British", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Brits": {"name": "Brits", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Cairo": {"name": "Cairo", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "California": {"name": "California", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Department of State": {"name": "Department of State", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Dorotea Gucciardo": {"name": "Dorotea Gucciardo", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Duckworth": {"name": "Duckworth", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Egypt": {"name": "Egypt", "tag_type": "Country"}, "FAJR": {"name": "FAJR", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Gaza": {"name": "Gaza", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Gazan": {"name": "Gazan", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Gazans": {"name": "Gazans", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Glia Equal Care": {"name": "Glia Equal Care", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Haleh Sheikholesami": {"name": "Haleh Sheikholesami", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Hamawy": {"name": "Hamawy", "tag_type": "PER"}, "IDF": {"name": "IDF", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Iraq": {"name": "Iraq", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Ireland": {"name": "Ireland", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Israel": {"name": "Israel", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Israel Defense Forces": {"name": "Israel Defense Forces", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Jersey": {"name": "Jersey", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Jerusalem": {"name": "Jerusalem", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Johnston": {"name": "Johnston", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Jordan": {"name": "Jordan", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Monica Johnston": {"name": "Monica Johnston", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Mosab Nasser": {"name": "Mosab Nasser", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Muscat": {"name": "Muscat", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Nasser": {"name": "Nasser", "tag_type": "PER"}, "New Jersey": {"name": "New Jersey", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "OCHA": {"name": "OCHA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Oman": {"name": "Oman", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Palestinian": {"name": "Palestinian", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Palestinians": {"name": "Palestinians", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Rafah": {"name": "Rafah", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "State Department": {"name": "State Department", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Tammy Duckworth": {"name": "Tammy Duckworth", "tag_type": "PER"}, "United States": {"name": "United States", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Western": {"name": "Western", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Medical Workers Evacuated From Gaza, but 3 Americans Refuse to Leave"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-18T01:08:28.908095", "id": "22fa02ff-d869-4039-82ab-a7ff9018ac44", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "6"}, {"created": "2024-05-18T01:10:37.901431", "id": "39de3885-8e5a-4207-a66c-818271e4cba2", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "17"}], "created": "2024-05-17T23:31:14", "id": "dc6c759e-96a8-4309-8f93-b3bca7a84876", "news_items": [{"author": "Jessica Lyons", "content": "Aussie cops probe MediSecure's 'large-scale ransomware data breach'\nThrow another healthcare biz on the barby, mate\nAustralian prescriptions provider MediSecure is the latest healthcare org to fall victim to a ransomware attack, with crooks apparently stealing patients' personal and health data.\n\"While we continue to gather more information, early indicators suggest the incident originated from one of our third-party vendors,\" the e-script provider said in a statement on Thursday.\nMediSecure did not indicate how many individuals were affected by the incident, but promised to \"provide further updates via our website as soon as more information becomes available.\" It also said it is working with Oz's National Cyber Security Coordinator to \"manage the impacts of the incident,\" and has notified regulatory agencies including the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.\nAustralia's federal police are investigating the intrusion, which the National Cyber Security Coordinator described as a \"large-scale ransomware data breach incident.\"\nIn a separate statement on Thursday, the country's top cybersecurity chief said the Australian government \"continues to assist MediSecure,\" and that it's \"still working to build a picture of the size and nature of the data that has been impacted by this data breach.\"\nThe statement continued:\nFrom the information that is currently available to the government, no current ePrescriptions have been impacted or accessed.

Modeling for animation or special effects, reverse engineering or designing various devices or products, and working with fabrics and clothing are all well within the wide range of uses for these tools. [Vojislav] built one a few years ago which used an array of cameras to capture 3D information but the Pi camera modules used in this build limited the capabilities of the scanner in some ways. [Vojislav]\u2019s latest 3D scanner takes a completely different approach by using a single high-quality camera instead.\nThe new 3D scanner is built to carry a full-size DSLR camera, its lens, and a light. Much more similarly to how a 3D printer works, the platform moves the camera around the object in programmable steps for the desired 3D scan. The object being scanned sits on a rotating plate as well, allowing for the entire object to be scanned without needing to move the camera through a full 180\u00b0 in two axes.

It was first documented by TrustedSec in January 2020.\nIn recent years, campaigns involving the Golang-based malware have weaponized various flaws in Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Log4j, Apache NiFi, Atlassian Confluence, Citrix, Liferay Portal, Linux, Openfire, Oracle WebLogic Server, and SaltStack to breach vulnerable systems.\nOther methods have also involved exploited misconfigured Docker, PostgreSQL, and Redis instances to obtain initial access, after which the endpoints are marshaled into a botnet for crypto-mining, but not before disabling security services and removing rival miners already installed on the hosts.\nSubsequent analysis by CyberArk in 2021 unearthed commonalities between Kinsing and another malware called NSPPS, concluding that both the strains \"represent the same family.\"\nKinsing's attack infrastructure falls into three primary categories: Initial servers used for scanning and exploiting vulnerabilities, download servers responsible for staging payloads and scripts, and command-and-control (C2) servers that maintain contact with compromised servers.\nThe IP addresses used for C2 servers resolve to Russia, while those that are used to download the scripts and binaries span countries like Luxembourg, Russia, the Netherlands, and Ukraine.\n\"Kinsing targets various operating systems with different tools,\" Aqua said. \"For instance, Kinsing often uses shell and Bash scripts to exploit Linux servers.\"\n\"We've also seen that Kinsing is targeting Openfire on Windows servers using a PowerShell script. When running on Unix, it's usually looking to download a binary that runs on x86 or ARM.\"\nAnother notable aspect of the threat actor's campaigns is that 91% of the targeted applications are open-source, with the group mainly singling runtime applications (67%), databases (9%), and cloud infrastructure (8).\nCredit: Forescout |\nAn extensive analysis of the artifacts has further revealed three distinct categories of programs -\nType I and Type II scripts, which are deployed post initial access and are used to download next-stage attack components, eliminate competition, and evade defenses by disabling firewall, terminating security tools like SELinux, AppArmor, and Aliyun Aegis, and deploying a rootkit to hide the malicious processes\n-\nAuxiliary scripts, which are designed to accomplish initial access by exploiting a vulnerability, disable specific security components associated with Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud services from a Linux system, open a reverse shell to a server under the attacker's control, and facilitate the retrieval of miner payloads\n-\nBinaries, which act as a second-stage payload, including the core Kinsing malware and the crypto-miner to miner Monero\n-\nThe malware, for its part, is engineered to keep tabs on the mining process and share its process identifier (PID) with the C2 server, perform connectivity checks, and send execution results, among others.\n\"Kinsing targets Linux and Windows systems, often by exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications or misconfigurations such as Docker API and Kubernetes to run cryptominers,\" Aqua said. \"To prevent potential threats like Kinsing, proactive measures such as hardening workloads pre-deployment are crucial.\"\nThe disclosure comes as botnet malware families are increasingly finding ways to broaden their reach and recruit machines into a network for carrying out malicious activities.\nThis is best exemplified by P2PInfect, a Rust malware that has been found to exploit poorly-secured Redis servers to deliver variants compiled for MIPS and ARM architectures.\n\"The main payload is capable of performing various operations, including propagating and delivering other modules with filenames that speak for themselves like miner and winminer,\" Nozomi Networks, which discovered samples targeting ARM earlier this year, said.\n\"As its name suggests, the malware is capable of performing Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communications without relying on a single Command and Control server (C&C) to propagate attackers' commands.\"", "hash":

Guardian, written by Caroline Haskins: On May 7th and 8th in Washington, D.C., the city's biggest convention hall welcomed America's military-industrial complex, its top technology companies and its most outspoken justifiers of war crimes. Of course, that's not how they would describe it. It was the inaugural \"AI Expo for National Competitiveness,\" hosted by the Special Competitive Studies Project -- better known as the \"techno-economic\" thinktank created by the former Google CEO and current billionaire Eric Schmidt. The conference's lead sponsor was Palantir, a software company co-founded by Peter Thiel that's best known for inspiring 2019 protests against its work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) at the height of Trump's family separation policy. Currently, Palantir is supplying some of its AI products to the Israel Defense Forces.\nThe conference hall was also filled with booths representing the U.S. military and dozens of its contractors, ranging from Booz Allen Hamilton to a random company that was described to me as Uber for airplane software. At industry conferences like these, powerful people tend to be more unfiltered \u2013 they assume they're in a safe space, among friends and peers. I was curious, what would they say about the AI-powered violence in Gaza, or what they think is the future of war?\nAttendees were told the conference highlight would be a series of panels in a large room toward the back of the hall. In reality, that room hosted just one of note. Featuring Schmidt and the Palantir CEO, Alex Karp, the fire-breathing panel would set the tone for the rest of the conference. More specifically, it divided attendees into two groups: those who see war as a matter of money and strategy, and those who see it as a matter of death. The vast majority of people there fell into group one. I've written about relationships between tech companies and the military before, so I shouldn't have been surprised by anything I saw or heard at this conference. But when it ended, and I departed DC for home, it felt like my life force had been completely sucked out of my body. Some of the noteworthy quotes from the panel and convention, as highlighted in Haskins' reporting, include:\n\"It's always great when the CIA helps you out,\" Schmidt joked when CIA deputy director David Cohen lent him his microphone when his didn't work.\nThe U.S. has to \"scare our adversaries to death\" in war, said Karp. On university graduates protesting Israel's war in Gaza, Karp described their views as a \"pagan religion infecting our universities\" and \"an infection inside of our society.\"\n\"The peace activists are war activists,\" Karp insisted. \"We are the peace activists.\"\nA huge aspect of war in a democracy, Karp went on to argue, is leaders successfully selling that war domestically. \"If we lose the intellectual debate, you will not be able to deploy any armies in the west ever,\" Karp said.\nA man in nuclear weapons research jokingly referred to himself as \"the new Oppenheimer.\"\nThe conference hall was also filled with booths representing the U.S. military and dozens of its contractors, ranging from Booz Allen Hamilton to a random company that was described to me as Uber for airplane software.

Er stellt fest, dass der Defender Core-Dienst unter Windows 10 Pro vor gut einem Monat unerwartet gestartet wurde. Seit dieser Zeit wird der Temp-Ordner des Lesers von Dateien mit dem Muster mat-debug*.log geflutet. Es scheint keine Konfigurationsm\u00f6glichkeit zu geben. Bei einer kurzen Internet-Recherche habe ich aber festgestellt, dass diese log-Dateien seit 2019 in unterschiedlichen Szenarien thematisiert wurde. Mich interessiert die Frage, ob noch jemand diese Beobachtung gemacht hat.\nAnzeige\nDer Microsoft Defender Core-Dienst\nEine \u00dcbersicht findet sich in diesem Support-Beitrag von Microsoft. Der Microsoft Defender Core-Dienst wurde laut diesem Support-Beitrag ver\u00f6ffentlicht, um die Endpunktsicherheit zu verbessern und die Stabilit\u00e4t sowie die Leistung von Microsoft Defender Antivirus zu unterst\u00fctzen. Ver\u00f6ffentlicht wird der Microsoft Defender Core-Dienst wird mit der Microsoft Defender Antivirus-Plattformversion 4.18.23110.2009. Microsoft hat folgende Termine f\u00fcr den Rollout ver\u00f6ffentlicht.\nNovember 2023, um Kunden vorab zu pr\u00e4sentieren (also eine Preview).\n-\nMitte April 2024 f\u00fcr Unternehmenskunden, die Windows-Clients ausf\u00fchren.\n-\nMitte Juni 2024 f\u00fcr US-Beh\u00f6rdenkunden, die Windows-Clients ausf\u00fchren.\n-\nDie Timeline ist wichtig zum Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr nachfolgende Leserbeobachtungen. Microsoft gibt an, dass Unternehmenskunden folgende URLs zulassen sollen, da der Defender Core-Dienst mit diesen URLs kommuniziert.\n*.endpoint.security.microsoft.com\necs.office.com/config/v1/MicrosoftWindowsDefenderClient\n*.events.data.microsoft.com\nDer Supportbeitrag von Microsoft enth\u00e4lt weitere Hinweise zu URLs, mit denen kommuniziert wird, falls man keine Wildcard-URLs zulassen m\u00f6chte.\nEin Prozess erzeugt .log Files\nDer Blog-Leser schrieb mir in einer E-Mail vom 3. Mai 2024, dass \"vor etwa einem Monat der Defender Core-Dienst unerwartet auf dem Win10Pro gestartet wurde.\" Der Leser vermutet, dass dies vom OneSetting-Service erfolgte. Die \"vage Angabe\" vor etwas einem Monat deckt sich in etwa mit oben Microsoft Rollout-Terminen.\nDem Leser ist das Ganze aufgefallen, weil im Temp-Ordner pl\u00f6tzlich mat-debug****.log-Dateien landen. Laut Blog-Leser ist, au\u00dfer der Richtlinie f\u00fcr den OneSetting-Service keine Konfiguration im Hinblick auf diese Log-Dateien m\u00f6glich. Auf einem nicht [mit dem Internet] verbunden Rechner ist der [Dienst] nicht aktiv, schrieb der Leser in seiner Mail. Er vermutet einen \"Experimentation Configuration Service\", den Microsoft auf die Nutzer los l\u00e4sst.\nIch habe im Support-Beitrag von Microsoft aber den Abschnitt Use PowerShell to update the policies for Microsoft Defender Core service. gefunden, wo diverse Richtlinien zur Konfigurierung des Core-Diensts zu finden sind. Man kann die Telemetrieb sowie die Core-Service-ESC-Integration abschalten.\nAlte Fundstellen im Web\nIch habe mal nach mat-debug Log-Dateien im Internet gesucht. Erste Treffer im Microsoft Answers-Forum finden sich bereits 2019 (siehe mat-debug-xxxx.log files in temp folder), wobei es hei\u00dft, dass die Dateien eine L\u00e4nge 0 haben. Auch aus dem Jahr 2020 gibt es einen Beitrag mat-debug-xxxx.log files im Microsoft Answers-Forum, der sich mit diesen Dateien befasst. Es kann also nicht ausschlie\u00dflich mit dem Defender Core-Dienst zusammen h\u00e4ngen, dass die log-Dateien pl\u00f6tzlich im Temp-Ordner des Blog-Lesers landen. In beiden oben verlinkten Microsoft Answers-Foren-Threads gibt es den Hinweis (siehe hier), dass der Nutzer den Grafiktreiber erneut installieren solle. Der Effekt werde durch einen unsignierten Treiber hervorgerufen.\nAnzeige\nAus dem Dezember 2023 gibt es den Microsoft Answers Forenthread What's the purpose of mat-debug-*.log files created by msteamsupdate.exe, in dem der Update-Prozess von Microsoft Teams als Verursacher genannt wird. Der Thread-Startet gibt an, dass er mittels Process Monitor herausgefunden habe, dass die .log-Dateien von msteamsupdate.exe und ms-teamsupdate.exe geschrieben werden.\nAuf askwoody.com gibt es noch diesen Thread, aus dem hervorgeht, dass die log-Dateien geschrieben werden, wenn irgend ein Update schief l\u00e4uft. Genannt wurden OneDrive und Microsoft Office. Susan Bradley macht den OfficeHub verantwortlich. So richtig befriedigend sind die Funde im Internet aber nicht. Daher die Frage: Hat noch wer diese log-Dateien bei sich im Temp-Ordner von Windows oder des Benutzerprofils gefunden, und kennt jemand die Ursache?\nCookies blockieren entzieht uns die Finanzierung: Cookie-Einstellungen\nDiese Dateien \"begleiten\" mich schon seit sehr langer Zeit (auch schon bei Windows 7) Treten \u2013 ohne bestimmten Rhythmus \u2013 mal mehr und mal weniger auf. Ursache und Wirkung unbekannt; wie bei so vielen Dateien, die sich in den verschiedenen Temp-Ordnern befinden. Auch im User-Ordner z. B.

It's an agreement similar to the one Reddit signed with Google earlier this year that was reportedly worth $60 million. The deal will also \"enable Reddit to bring new AI-powered features to Redditors and mods\" and use OpenAI's large language models to build applications. OpenAI has also signed up to become an advertising partner on Reddit.\nNo financial terms were revealed in the blog post announcing the arrangement, and neither company mentioned training data, either.

The experts speculate the Lunar toolset has been employed since at least 2020. ESET attributes the two backdoors to Russia-linked APT group Turla, with medium confidence.\nThe Turla APT group (aka Snake, Uroburos, Waterbug, Venomous Bear and KRYPTON) has been active since at least 2004 targeting diplomatic and government organizations and private businesses in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, North and South America, and former Soviet bloc nations.\nThe exact method of initial access in the compromises observed by ESET is still unclear. However, evidence suggests possible spear-phishing and exploitation of misconfigured Zabbix network and application monitoring software. The researchers noticed a LunarWeb component mimicking Zabbix logs and a backdoor command retrieving Zabbix agent configuration. The experts also spotted spear-phishing messages, including a weaponized Word document installing a LunarMail backdoor.\n\u201cLunarWeb, deployed on servers, uses HTTP(S) for its C&C communications and mimics legitimate requests, while LunarMail, deployed on workstations, is persisted as an Outlook add-in and uses email messages for its C&C communications.\u201d reads the report published by ESET.\nLunarWeb uses multiple persistence methods, including creating Group Policy extensions, replacing System DLL, and deploying as part of legitimate software.\nESET reported that the execution chain starts with a loader they tracked as LunarLoader. It uses the RC4 symmetric key cipher to decrypt the payloads.\nOnce the Lunar backdoor has compromised a system, it waits for commands from the C2 server. The cyberspies also used stolen credentials for lateral movement.\nLunarWeb can also execute shell and PowerShell commands, gather system information, run Lua code, and exfiltrate data in AES-256 encrypted form.\n\u201cOur current investigation began with the detection of a loader decrypting and running a payload, from an external file, on an unidentified server. This led us to the discovery of a previously unknown backdoor, which we named LunarWeb. Subsequently, we detected a similar chain with LunarWeb deployed at a diplomatic institution of a European MFA. Notably, the attacker also included a second backdoor \u2013 which we named LunarMail \u2013 that uses a different method for command and control (C&C) communications.\u201d continues the report. \u201cDuring another attack, we observed simultaneous deployments of a chain with LunarWeb at three diplomatic institutions of this MFA in the Middle East, occurring within minutes of each other. The attacker probably had prior access to the domain controller of the MFA and utilized it for lateral movement to machines of related institutions in the same network.\u201d\nLunarMail is deployed on workstations with Microsoft Outlook, using an email-based communication system (Outlook Messaging API (MAPI)) to evade detection in environments where HTTPS traffic is monitored. The backdoor communicates with the C2 server via email attachments, often hidden in .PNG images. LunarMail can create processes, take screenshots, write files, and execute Lua scripts, allowing it to run shell and PowerShell commands indirectly.\n\u201cWe observed varying degrees of sophistication in the compromises; for example, the careful installation on the compromised server to avoid scanning by security software contrasted with coding errors and different coding styles (which are not the scope of this blogpost) in the backdoors. This suggests multiple individuals were likely involved in the development and operation of these tools.\u201d concludes the report. \u201cAlthough the described compromises are more recent, our findings show that these backdoors evaded detection for a more extended period and have been in use since at least 2020, based on artifacts found in the Lunar toolset.\u201d\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n(SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, Turla APT)", "hash": "fb66b7248998efdb02704657997b88b02a0a4814a7788ce4963ce98b4ea166fb", "id": "af6bb4c3-db48-417c-8d47-15f8928b1f00", "link": "https://securityaffairs.com/163314/apt/turla-apt-new-backdoors.html", "osint_source_id": "d01d5487-bebf-40c5-a433-cdbe4670e633", "published": "2024-05-17T21:24:34", "source": "http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/feed", "story_id": "dc4bff93-2e9f-41de-a1bc-99c8406327f4", "title": "Turla APT used two new backdoors to infiltrate a European ministry of foreign affairs"}], "tags": {"AES-256": {"name": "AES-256", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Asia": {"name": "Asia", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "ESET": {"name": "ESET", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Europe": {"name": "Europe", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "European": {"name": "European", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "KRYPTON": {"name": "KRYPTON", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Lua": {"name": "Lua", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Lunar": {"name": "Lunar", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "LunarMail": {"name": "LunarMail", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "LunarWeb": {"name": "LunarWeb", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "MAPI": {"name": "MAPI", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "MFA": {"name": "MFA", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Mastodon": {"name": "Mastodon", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Middle East": {"name": "Middle East", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "North": {"name": "North", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Russia": {"name": "Russia", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Russia-linked": {"name": "Russia-linked", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "South America": {"name": "South America", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Soviet": {"name": "Soviet", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Turla": {"name": "Turla", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "Venomous Bear": {"name": "Venomous Bear", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Waterbug": {"name": "Waterbug", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Zabbix": {"name": "Zabbix", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "phishing": {"name": "phishing", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Turla APT used two new backdoors to infiltrate a European ministry of foreign affairs"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-18T01:13:13.309069", "id": "e9e2e616-8187-449d-ad2a-ca52e5f50d4a", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "3"}, {"created": "2024-05-18T01:21:44.575026", "id": "ec7ef2c7-9c0b-409e-93c8-3f6c18046e80", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "15"}], "created": "2024-05-17T21:20:00", "id": "9e678778-4f22-4211-978c-c55eb8a755ee", "news_items": [{"author": "BeauHD", "content": "France Bans TikTok In New Caledonia (politico.eu) 11\nIn what's marked as an EU first, the French government has blocked TikTok in its territory of New Caledonia amid widespread pro-independence protests.

Unlike the average automaton, animals are not outfitted with bearings and similar types of joints, but rather rely sometimes on ball joints and a lot on rolling contact joints (RCJs). These RCJs have the advantage of being part of the skeletal structure, making them ideal for compact and small joints. This is the conclusion that [Breaking Taps] came to as well while designing the legs for a bird-like automaton.\nThese RCJs do not just have the surfaces which contact each other while rotating, but also provide the constraints for how far a particular joint is allowed to move, both in the forward and backward directions as well as sideways. In the case of the biological version these contact surfaces are also coated with a constantly renewing surface to prevent direct bone-on-bone contact. The use of RCJs is rather common in robotics, with the humanoid DRACO 3 platform as detailed in a 2023 research article by [Seung Hyeon Bang] and colleagues in Frontiers in Robotics and AI.\nThe other aspect of RCJs is that they have to be restrained with a compliant mechanism. In the video [Breaking Taps] uses fishing line for this, but many more options are available. The \u2018best option\u2019 also depends on the usage and forces which the specific joint will be subjected to. For further reading on the kinematics in robotics and kin, we covered the book Exact Constraint: Machine Design Using Kinematic Principles by [Douglass L. Blanding] a while ago.\nOne thought on \u201cEmulating Biology For Robots With Rolling Contact Joints\u201d\nGreat video.

Ferner gehen wir auf Outdoor-Smartphones (Bestenliste) ein, die ebenfalls \u00fcber eine solche Infrarot-Kamera verf\u00fcgen und zeigen klassische Handheld-W\u00e4rmebildkameras.\nWeitere Ratgeber f\u00fcr Hobbyhandwerker sind Befestigen, Messen, Markieren & Co.: Diese Werkzeuge geh\u00f6ren in jede Werkstatt und Digitale Messger\u00e4te in der Werkstatt: Multimeter, Oszilloskop, Winkelmesser & Co.\nWie funktioniert eine W\u00e4rmebildkamera?\nEine W\u00e4rmebildkamera erfasst Infrarotstrahlung, die von Objekten emittiert wird. Das Prinzip basiert auf der Tatsache, dass alle Objekte mit einer Temperatur \u00fcber dem absoluten Nullpunkt (-273 Grad Celsius oder 0 Kelvin) Infrarotstrahlung abgeben. Damit ist es m\u00f6glich, die W\u00e4rme einer Oberfl\u00e4che zu erkennen. Oft nennt man eine solche Linse einfach nur Infrarot-Kamera. Hier ist aber zu unterscheiden zwischen W\u00e4rmebild- sowie Nachtsichtkameras. Letztere nutzen Restlicht oder Infrarotlicht, um die das Bild bei Dunkelheit aufzuhellen.\nBeide Technologien haben unterschiedliche Anwendungen und erg\u00e4nzen sich in verschiedenen Szenarien. Eine W\u00e4rmebildkamera soll prim\u00e4r Temperaturunterschiede von Oberfl\u00e4chen darstellen, w\u00e4hrend die Nachtsichtkamera die Sichtbarkeit bei v\u00f6lliger Dunkelheit durch vorhandenes Licht sowie reflektiertes Infrarotlicht gew\u00e4hrleistet. Letzteres kommt bei \u00dcberwachungskameras mit Nachtsicht (Bestenliste) zum Einsatz \u2013 oft in Schwarz-wei\u00df, aber es gibt auch farbige Varianten.\nDas Bild einer W\u00e4rmebildkamera ist farbig dargestellt \u2013 man nennt das auch Pseudofarbdarstellung. Denn Temperaturen an sich sind nicht durch Farben wahrnehmbar, aber das menschliche Auge kann diese durch die farbige Darstellung einfacher erkennen. Das erleichtert die schnelle Identifikation von Temperaturunterschieden und Hotspots. Sie ist auch f\u00fcr den Benutzer leichter zu verstehen als eine Darstellung in Graustufen.\nWof\u00fcr ben\u00f6tigt man eine W\u00e4rmebildkamera?\nEine W\u00e4rmebildkamera kann im Haushalt vielf\u00e4ltig eingesetzt werden, um verschiedene Aspekte der Geb\u00e4ude- und Haushalts\u00fcberwachung zu verbessern. Folgende Anwendungsbereiche sind denkbar:\nEnergieeffizienz: W\u00e4rmelecks in W\u00e4nden, Fenstern und T\u00fcren finden.\n-\nElektroger\u00e4te\u00fcberwachung: Fr\u00fcherkennung von \u00dcberhitzung oder Funktionsst\u00f6rungen in Elektroger\u00e4ten.\n-\nHeizung: Diagnose von Heizungsanlagen f\u00fcr Effizienzsteigerungen und gleichm\u00e4\u00dfige W\u00e4rmeverteilung.\n-\nRohrleitungen und Wasserlecks: Aufsp\u00fcren von undichten Stellen in Rohrleitungen und Identifizierung von Wassersch\u00e4den in der Geb\u00e4udestruktur.\n-\nSch\u00e4dlingsbek\u00e4mpfung: Suche nach Verstecken von Sch\u00e4dlingen, da diese oft als W\u00e4rmequellen erscheinen.\n-\nFerner k\u00f6nnen Infrarot-Kameras interessant sein f\u00fcr Naturfreunde, J\u00e4ger oder F\u00f6rster, die nachts Tiere ausfindig machen wollen.\nW\u00e4rmebildkameras f\u00fcr Smartphones\nEine besonders einfache, komfortable und platzsparende L\u00f6sung sind Adapter mit Thermolinse zum Nachr\u00fcsten f\u00fcr das Handy. Flir ist die bekannteste Marke der Branche. Weitere wichtige Anbieter sind Infiray, Xinfrared, Seek Thermal, Hikmicro oder Topdon. Varianten mit Micro-USB gibt es ebenfalls.\nDie Flir One Gen 3 bekommt man mit USB-C f\u00fcr Android-Smartphones ab 179 Euro, f\u00fcr Lightning-Stecker (iOS) kostet das Flir One in dritter Generation 170 Euro. Die Flir One Pro kostet mit USB-C f\u00fcr Android-Ger\u00e4te rund 362 Euro, mit Stecker f\u00fcr das iPhone etwa 370 Euro. Ger\u00e4te von Flir bieten MSX-Technologie (Multi-Spectral Dynamic Imaging). Diese nutzt sowohl die visuelle als auch W\u00e4rmbildkamera, um in Echtzeit physische Details wie Kanten und Umrisse hinzuf\u00fcgt. Dadurch entstehen klarere und detailreichere Bilder.\nInfiray P2 Pro im Test\nDas kleine Kameramodul von Infiray steckt man an das Smartphone. In Verbindung mit der App P2 Pro r\u00fcstet man so jedes Handy mit USB-C-Buchse mit einer kompakten W\u00e4rmebildkamera nach. Zum Lieferumfang geh\u00f6ren zudem ein zus\u00e4tzliches, magnetisches Makroobjektiv zum Aufstecken sowie ein Verl\u00e4ngerungskabel f\u00fcr USB-C.\nDie Einrichtung ist denkbar einfach: App P2 Pro aus dem Google Play Store herunterladen und Kameramodul einstecken \u2013 und los geht es. In der App stehen verschiedene Farbpaletten zur Verf\u00fcgung \u2013 also Schemata, wie die W\u00e4rme jeweils farblich angezeigt werden. Der Modus \u201eEisenrot\u201c hebt deutlich w\u00e4rmere Bereiche (etwa einen Radiator) in gl\u00fchendem Orange hervor, w\u00e4hrend die k\u00fchlere Umgebung eher in blauen und violettfarbigen T\u00f6nen erscheinen. Insgesamt gibt es zehn farbige und zwei schwarz-wei\u00dfe Paletten. Wer besonders nah an einen Bereich ran m\u00f6chte, befestigt das magnetische Makroobjektiv auf dem Kamera-Adapter.\nDas Kamerabild dient als Infrarot-Thermometer. Es ist ferner m\u00f6glich, die Ansicht der Smartphone-Kamera in einem kleinen Kasten \u00fcber das Bild zu legen. Ein Alarm beim \u00dcberschreiten einer bestimmten Temperatur ist ebenfalls m\u00f6glich. Die IR-Aufl\u00f6sung liegt bei 256 \u00d7 192 Pixeln. Die Brennweite des Objektivs betr\u00e4gt 3,2 mm. Der Messbereich reicht von -20 Grad Celsius bis 550 Grad Celsius.\nBei Banggood kostet die kompakte W\u00e4rmebildkamera zum Nachr\u00fcsten Infiray P2 Pro aktuell nur 190 Euro. Bei Amazon ist das Modell derzeit vergriffen.\nInfiray P2 Pro\nInfiray P2 Pro\nXinfrared T2S Plus im Test\nEine kompakte L\u00f6sung ist das T2S Plus W\u00e4rmebildkameramodul zum Nachr\u00fcsten von Xinfrared. Getestet haben wir die Variante f\u00fcr Smartphones mit USB-C-Anschluss. Es gibt auch eine Variante mit Lightning-Stecker f\u00fcr das iPhone bis Version 14. Man steckt das Modul einfach in das Smartphone ein und installiert anschlie\u00dfend die App Xtherm aus dem Google Play Store. Ein Pendant dazu im Apple App Store gibt es ebenfalls. Kompatibel ist die T2S Plus mit Android, Harmony OS und iOS. Die Kamera wiegt nur rund 18 g und ist etwas gr\u00f6\u00dfer als ein Daumennagel.\nAusgestattet ist das Xinfrared T2S Plus mit einer 8-mm-W\u00e4rmebildlinse mit einer \u00d6ffnung von f/1.2, die Werte von -20 bis 450 Grad Celsius mit einer Toleranz von 2 Grad Celsius messen kann. Der Infrarot-Sensor stammt von Infiray, bietet eine Bildrate von 25 Hz und eine Aufl\u00f6sung von 256 \u00d7 192 Pixel. Das Sichtfeld betr\u00e4gt 44,9 Grad x 33,4 Grad laut technischer Daten. Die Bildsch\u00e4rfe k\u00f6nnen Nutzer an der Linse manuell einstellen. Auch ein Video als MPEG-4 k\u00f6nnen sie mit der Kamera aufzeichnen.\nDie Anzeige l\u00e4sst sich in der App drehen oder als Einblendung das regul\u00e4re Kamerabild als kleinen Kasten links oben \u00fcber das W\u00e4rmebild legen. \u00dcber das Fadenkreuz zeigt die App auf dem Bild als Infrarot-Thermometer die W\u00e4rme an einer bestimmten Stelle an, optional kann jeweils die h\u00f6chste und niedrigste Temperatur im Bildausschnitt dargestellt werden. Es stehen f\u00fcnf verschieden Farbpaletten und zwei Monochromansichten zur Auswahl. Auf Wunsch kann man einen bestimmten Bereich des Bildes in der App mit einem Rechteck, Strich oder Punkt markieren, um die dortige Temperatur anzeigen zu lassen. Auf Wunsch k\u00f6nnen Nutzer einen Alarm festlegen, der ab einem bestimmten W\u00e4rmegrad ert\u00f6nt.\nDie Variante sowohl f\u00fcr das iPhone (iOS) mit Lightning als auch Android-Smartphones mit USB-C kostet beim Hersteller knapp 312 Euro \u2013 ist aber derzeit vergriffen. Ein H\u00e4ndler bei Ebay bietet das baugleiche T2S Plus unter der Marke Infiray derzeit f\u00fcr 340 Euro an.\nXinfrared T2S Plus - Bilderstrecke\nXinfrared T2S Plus - Bilderstrecke\nStandalone-W\u00e4rmebildkameras\nWer auf eine Standalone-L\u00f6sung setzt, muss gar nicht so viel Geld ausgeben. So bekommt man eine W\u00e4rmebildkamera mit Pistolengriff von Voltcraft bereits f\u00fcr knapp 162 Euro. Modelle f\u00fcr Profis sind deutlich teurer, daf\u00fcr aber pr\u00e4ziser und mit einer h\u00f6heren thermischen Empfindlichkeit ausgestattet.\nGute Erfahrungen hat ein Kollege mit dem Bosch Professional GTC 400 C f\u00fcr 899 Euro gemacht. Beim Hausbau konnte er damit W\u00e4rmebr\u00fccken in der Isolierung sowie Bodenheizungsrohren entdecken. Das Ger\u00e4t \u00fcberzeugt mit guter IR-Aufl\u00f6sung und Software, mit der ein Anwender alle Parameter auch nachtr\u00e4glich \u00e4ndern k\u00f6nnen.\nW\u00e4rmebildkamera Kaiweets KTI-W01 im Test\nWer unabh\u00e4ngig vom Smartphone nach W\u00e4rmebr\u00fccken, Lecks in der D\u00e4mmung oder nach Warmwasser- und Stromleitungen suchen m\u00f6chte, kann zu einer Standalone-L\u00f6sung greifen. Getestet haben wir die Kaiweets KTI-W01.\nDas Ger\u00e4t bietet einen Pistolengriff, mehre Tasten und ein 3,2-Zoll-Display. Die Handheld-W\u00e4rmebildkamera deckt Temperaturen von -20 bis 550 Grad Celsius bei einer Toleranz von rund 2 Grad ab. Die hohe Aufl\u00f6sung betr\u00e4gt 256 \u00d7 192 Pixel. Es stehen drei Bildmodi zur Verf\u00fcgung: Nur W\u00e4rmebild mittels Infrarot, visuelle Kamera und eine \u00dcberlagerung beider Aufnahmen \u2013 was praktisch sein kann, um genauer zu erkennen, wo genau sich m\u00f6gliche Temperaturunterschiede befinden. Die thermische Empfindlichkeit liegt laut technischer Daten bei rund 50 mK.\nDie Kaiweets KTI-W01 liegt gut in der Hand und liefert ein klares Bild auf der kleinen Anzeige. Per Knopfdruck sichert man die Aufnahme. F\u00fcr die Darstellung der Farben stehen f\u00fcnf verschiedene Farbmodi zur Auswahl. Eine Ver\u00e4nderung der Emissionsgrad-Einstellungen ist ebenfalls m\u00f6glich. Verglichen mit dem ansteckbaren Dongles weicht das Stand-alone-Ger\u00e4t etwas ab und zeigt bis zu 3 bis 4 Grad h\u00f6here Temperaturen an \u2013 wir vermuten, die Kaiweets KTI-W01 ist etwas pr\u00e4ziser als die Nachr\u00fcstl\u00f6sungen. Um die Aufnahmen auf einen PC zu kopieren, ist eine USB-C-Buchse vorhanden. \u00dcber den Anschluss l\u00e4dt man zudem den im Griff integrierten und austauschbaren Akku.\nDirekt beim Hersteller kostet die W\u00e4rmebildkamera mit dem exklusiven, dauerhaften Coupon-Code TS15 (Rabatt von 15 Prozent) nur 239 Euro.\nKaiweets KTI-W01 - Bilderstrecke\nKaiweets KTI-W01 - Bilderstrecke\nWelches Handy hat eine W\u00e4rmebildkamera?\nZahlreiche Outdoor-Handys (Bestenliste) verf\u00fcgen neben Nachtsichtkameras auch \u00fcber eine W\u00e4rmebildkamera. Teilweise gilt das auch in Kombination mit einer IR-Linse f\u00fcr Nachtsicht, wie einige der Modelle aus unseren Tests zeigen.\nBeim AGM G2 Guardian (Testbericht) handelt es sich um ein Outdoor-Handy der Premium-Klasse. Der Preis ist mit 959 Euro ziemlich hoch, daf\u00fcr bietet das Ger\u00e4t einen flotten Prozessor, 120-Hertz-LCD und Nachtsicht- sowie W\u00e4rmebildkamera mit gro\u00dfer Reichweite von bis zu 500 Metern.\nDas bessere Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis bietet das Doogee V31GT (Testbericht) f\u00fcr 438 Euro. 5G und ein ordentlicher Prozessor geh\u00f6ren neben W\u00e4rmebild- und Nachtsichtkamera sowie 120-Hertz-Display zur Ausstattung. Der Sensor stammt von Infiray.\nDas Ulefone Power Armor 19T (Testbericht) f\u00fcr 415 Euro hat einen riesigen Akku und l\u00e4uft mehrere Tage durch. W\u00e4rmebild ist an Bord, daf\u00fcr gibt es aber nur 4G und keine Nachsicht. Der Sensor stammt sogar von Flir. Weitere Mobilger\u00e4te mit W\u00e4rmebildkamera gibt es von Blackview, Oukitel und Doogee.\nOutdoor-Handys mit W\u00e4rmebildkamera\nOutdoor-Handys mit W\u00e4rmebildkamera\nDrohne: Fliegende W\u00e4rmebildkamera\nF\u00fcr die eigenen vier W\u00e4nden weniger geeignet, aber dennoch ein gro\u00dfer Spa\u00df ist die Parrot Anafi Thermal (Testbericht). Die Drohne ist mit einem Preis von 3200 Euro kein Schn\u00e4ppchen, geh\u00f6rt aber dennoch zu den preiswerten Modellen mit W\u00e4rmebildkamera.\nDank ihrer guten Flugeigenschaften, einfachen Handhabung und einer mittlerweile ausgereiften App stellt die Drohne ein \u00e4u\u00dferst interessantes Werkzeug f\u00fcr Selbstst\u00e4ndige und Unternehmen dar, insbesondere im Bereich der W\u00e4rmed\u00e4mmung und Wartung. Aber auch f\u00fcr F\u00f6rster ist die Drohne interessant und Bauern k\u00f6nnen vor dem M\u00e4hdrescher-Einsatz Felder nach Rehkitzen absuchen.\nParrot Anafi Thermal\nParrot Anafi Thermal\nFazit\nEine W\u00e4rmebildkamera ist sehr praktisch. So erkennt man damit zu Hause schneller eine schwache Isolierung, ein Leck in einer Wasserleitung oder Ger\u00e4te, die m\u00f6glicherweise zu \u00fcberhitzen drohen. Zudem kann man damit in der Dunkelheit S\u00e4ugetiere aufsp\u00fcren.\nEine vergleichsweise preiswerte M\u00f6glichkeit ergibt sich mit einem W\u00e4rmebildkameramodul zum Nachr\u00fcsten. Dieses steckt man einfach in das Handy ein und kann es per App nutzen. Diese L\u00f6sung ist zudem platzsparend. Eine Alternative w\u00e4re zudem ein Outdoor-Ger\u00e4t mit eingebauter W\u00e4rmebildkamera. Standalone-L\u00f6sungen bieten mehr Komfort und oft eine h\u00f6here Genauigkeit, sind dann aber meistens teurer.\nWeitere Mobilger\u00e4te mit Infrarot-Features zeigen wir in der Top 10: Das beste Outdoor-Handy im Test \u2013 No-Name vor Samsung, Cat, Nokia & Co.

Li lives in China, the United Arab Emirates and Cambodia, the DOJ said.\nAccording to court documents unsealed Friday, Zhang and Li directed an intricate money laundering web in which a team of subordinates opened up approximately 74 shell companies and associated bank accounts. Pig butchering typically involves a scammer forming a relationship with a victim on messaging platforms before persuading them to make fraudulent investments.\nMoney stolen from victims was deposited into those accounts before being transferred to two bank accounts at Deltec bank in the Bahamas, the DOJ said. One of the Bahaman accounts was registered by a company called GTAL (Cambodia) Co., Ltd., which is based in the coastal city of Sihanoukville \u2014 a notorious pig butchering hub rife with scam compounds.\nEventually, the funds were converted to USDT \u2014 a cryptocurrency tied to the value of the U.S. dollar \u2014 including to a Binance wallet purportedly connected with Li. A separate wallet allegedly connected to the scheme received about $341 million in virtual currency over three years beginning in April 2021.\nThe arrests are part of an investigation that began in September 2022 into a \u201ccriminal money-laundering syndicate\u201d operating investment scams. In December 2023, that investigation resulted in charges against four people accused of laundering criminal proceeds and the arrest of two of the men.\nA search of their phones allegedly revealed communication with Li, who was shown to have \u201ca leadership role in determining where victim funds should be sent and in the management of the bank accounts receiving victim funds.\u201d\nAccording to the complaint against Li, a victim of the scheme in New Jersey approached investigators about an investment scam beginning in May 2022 saying he had been contacted on WhatsApp by a person going by \u201cAngela,\u201d who eventually convinced him to make cryptocurrency investments on a spoofed platform imitating the legitimate exchange CoinZoom. In two months, he invested about $1.5 million, but when he tried to cash out he was informed he needed to pay a fee and taxes.\n\u201cVictim 1\u2019s experience with the fraud is generally consistent with those of hundreds of other victims who have reported their losses to law enforcement,\u201d a U.S. Secret Service agent wrote in the complaint.\nInvestigators tracked a portion of the funds to a bank account connected to CMD Export and Import, allegedly one of the 74 shell companies created as part of Li and Zhang\u2019s scheme.\nThe men are both charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and six counts of international money laundering and face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Zhang has pleaded not guilty to the charges, while Li has yet to be arraigned.\nLast year, reported American losses due to crypto-linked investment fraud jumped to $3.96 billion, according to the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center.\n\u201cComplex financial fraud schemes such as pig butchering present a clear and present threat to the financial infrastructure of the United States as countless numbers of Americans continue to be victimized by this predatory activity,\u201d Assistant Director of Investigations Brian Lambert of the Secret Service said in a DOJ release.\nJames Reddick\nhas worked as a journalist around the world, including in Lebanon and in Cambodia, where he was Deputy Managing Editor of The Phnom Penh Post.

The new requirements will be binding on broker-dealers (including funding portals), investment companies, registered investment advisers, and transfer agents.\n\"Over the last 24 years, the nature, scale, and impact of data breaches has transformed substantially,\" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said. \"These amendments to Regulation S-P will make critical updates to a rule first adopted in 2000 and help protect the privacy of customers\u2019 financial data. The basic idea for covered firms is if you\u2019ve got a breach, then you\u2019ve got to notify. That\u2019s good for investors.\"\nNotifications must detail the incident, what information was compromised, and how those affected can protect themselves. In what appears to be a loophole in the requirements, covered institutions don\u2019t have to issue notices if they establish that the personal information has not been used in a way to result in \u201csubstantial harm or inconvenience\u201d or isn\u2019t likely to.\nThe amendments will require covered institutions to \u201cdevelop, implement, and maintain written policies and procedures\u201d that are \u201creasonably designed to detect, respond to, and recover from unauthorized access to or use of customer information.\u201d The amendments also:\n\u2022 Expand and align the safeguards and disposal rules to cover both nonpublic personal information that a covered institution collects about its own customers and nonpublic personal information it receives from another financial institution about customers of that financial institution;\n\u2022 Require covered institutions, other than funding portals, to make and maintain written records documenting compliance with the requirements of the safeguards rule and disposal rule;\n\u2022 Conform Regulation S-P\u2019s annual privacy notice delivery provisions to the terms of an exception added by the FAST Act, which provide that covered institutions are not required to deliver an annual privacy notice if certain conditions are met; and\n\u2022 Extend both the safeguards rule and the disposal rule to transfer agents registered with the Commission or another appropriate regulatory agency.\nThe requirements also broaden the scope of nonpublic personal information covered beyond what the firm itself collects. The new rules will also cover personal information the firm has received from another financial institution.\nSEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce voiced concern that the new requirements may go too far.\n\"Today\u2019s Regulation S-P modernization will help covered institutions appropriately prioritize safeguarding customer information,\" she https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-reg-s-p-051624 wrote. \"Customers will be notified promptly when their information has been compromised so they can take steps to protect themselves, like changing passwords or keeping a closer eye on credit scores. My reservations stem from the breadth of the rule and the likelihood that it will spawn more consumer notices than are helpful.\"\nRegulation S-P hadn't been substantially updated since its adoption in 2000.\nLast year, the SEC adopted new regulations requiring publicly traded companies to disclose security breaches that materially affect or are reasonably likely to materially affect business, strategy, or financial results or conditions.\nThe amendments take effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, the official journal of the federal government that publishes regulations, notices, orders, and other documents. Larger organizations will have 18 months to comply after modifications are published. Smaller organizations will have 24 months.\nPublic comments on the amendments are available here.\nreader comments\n11", "hash": "485435475243b03f40041a62a8dd089f2ba87b025fd693ff4bc4b61aa6544c4d", "id": "b19d818e-f56c-4c6a-997d-77beb2ed0446", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025242", "osint_source_id": "a71fce67-918e-4ec0-bd23-e575b5149c1b", "published": "2024-05-17T19:27:45", "source": "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/technology-lab", "story_id": "d406b215-a45c-4969-9625-ffc69d267bfa", "title": "Financial institutions have 30 days to disclose breaches under new rules"}], "tags": {"Commission": {"name": "Commission", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Federal Register": {"name": "Federal Register", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Gary Gensler": {"name": "Gary Gensler", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Hester M.

The students, Alexander Sherbrooke and Iakov Taranenko from UC Santa Cruz, reported the vulnerability to the company, a major laundry service provider, in January but claim it remains unpatched. TechCrunch adds: Sherbrooke said he was sitting on the floor of his basement laundry room in the early hours one January morning with his laptop in hand, and \"suddenly having an 'oh s-' moment.\" From his laptop, Sherbrooke ran a script of code with instructions telling the machine in front of him to start a cycle despite having $0 in his laundry account. The machine immediately woke up with a loud beep and flashed \"PUSH START\" on its display, indicating the machine was ready to wash a free load of laundry.\nIn another case, the students added an ostensible balance of several million dollars into one of their laundry accounts, which reflected in their CSC Go mobile app as though it were an entirely normal amount of money for a student to spend on laundry.\nIn another case, the students added an ostensible balance of several million dollars into one of their laundry accounts, which reflected in their CSC Go mobile app as though it were an entirely normal amount of money for a student to spend on laundry.\nseveral million dollars that will you hard time in (Score:2)\nseveral million dollars that will you hard time in san quintin\nRe: (Score:1, Funny)\nRe: (Score:2)\nAnd don't forget the spelling lesson!

When the phenomenon was first made public by the US in 2022, it was believed some Nork software devs were each raking in compensation in excess of $300,000 a year.\nVong's alleged role in the conspiracy, at least according to the Feds, was to secure positions at companies and then outsource that work to North Koreans who could actually do the technical work, all while keeping a percentage of the salary for his trouble and funneling the rest back to Pyongyang. A Vietnam native, Vong was a naturalized US citizen who actually worked in a nail salon.\nIn one case, the complaint claimed, a CEO of a company hopped on a video call with Vong to verify his identity by holding up to the camera a copy of his US passport and state driving license.\nThis was shortly after another individual, who was charged and named only as John Doe, applied for the same role and later appeared at work meetings after Vong was hired, the Feds allege. The complaint adds that they described themselves as a software developer working out of Shenyang, China, and claimed communications between Vong and John Doe indicated the dev was of North Korean descent.\nFeds arrest woman they claim is core cog in Nork's remote work machine\nAlso arrested this week was US national Christina Marie Chapman, 49, of Litchfield Park, Arizona, who allegedly helped North Korea on an even grander scale. She was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to commit identity fraud, conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, operating as an unlicensed money transmitting business, and unlawful employment of aliens.\nChapman was essentially accused of running a laptop farm \u2013 a residence in the US fitted with arrays of laptops that overseas or Nork workers can remote into and work from. The local IP address of the machines was intended to add a layer of perceived legitimacy to any remote work carried out for a US company, the DoJ claims.\nAccording to the indictment [PDF] against Chapman, she allegedly helped North Korean workers defraud major US companies, more than 300 in total, including various blue-chip companies across multiple industries.\nAmong the most high-profile victims in the alleged conspiracy were a \"top-five national television network and media company,\" a Silicon Valley tech biz, an aerospace and defense company, an \"iconic\" American car brand, a luxury retail chain, and \"one of the most recognizable media and entertainment companies in the world.\"\nData was also stolen from a multinational restaurant chain and class American clothing company, the indictment alleges.\nChapman is accused of helping overseas North Korean IT workers validate stolen US identities of which more than 60 are believed to have been compromised.\nA total of $6.8 million is thought to have been generated for overseas workers in the scheme Chapman allegedly helped facilitate.\nThere is currently a $5 million reward for information on three of the overseas workers Chapman helped via the State Department's Rewards for Justice program. The trio are officially referred to as John Doe 1, 2, and 3, but are known to use the aliases Jiho Han, Chunji Jin, and Haoran Xu. Deets about their manager \"Zhonghua\" could also yield a reward.\n\"On the surface, today's allegations of wire fraud, identity theft, and money laundering may read like a typical white collar or economic crime scheme,\" said Kevin Vorndran, assistant director at the FBI's Counterintelligence Division.\n\"But what these allegations truly represent is a new high-tech campaign to evade US sanctions, victimize US businesses, and steal US identities. The charges clearly demonstrate how the FBI and its partners will employ every resource at our disposal to bring to justice anyone who helps North Korea evade sanctions.\"\n\"The FBI has long stated that cybersecurity is national security and this case is living proof of that,\" said Akil Davis, special agent in charge at the FBI's Phoenix Field Office. \"That a woman living her quiet life in the outskirts of Phoenix can allegedly get so entangled in something like this clearly indicates our adversaries are getting more sophisticated and stealthier, so it's critical that businesses and citizens be hyper-vigilant with their cyber activities.\"\nIn October 2023, the US re-upped its awareness campaign of North Korea's tactics in this area, updating its guidance for organizations on how to spot a rogue Nork in the application process.\nAll things connected\nAt least some of the overseas workers who benefitted from Chapman's alleged crimes also worked with Ukrainian national Oleksandr Didenko, 27, of Kyiv, who was arrested earlier this month for similar matters.\nDidenko is primarily accused of running the website UpWorkSell which claimed to offer overseas IT workers the opportunity to register on freelance IT job sites using identities other than their own to secure gig work at US-based companies.\nHe's alleged to have run this service from January 2018 onwards and believed that at least some of the website's users were North Korean.\nLike Chapman, he's also accused of running a laptop farm. He was arrested in Poland at the request of Uncle Sam on May 7, and the US is currently trying to extradite him on charges of identity fraud.\nUpWorkSell was just one website seized by the US as part of this latest clampdown on North Korea's attempts to extract money from the US economy while evading the litany of sanctions against it.\nTwelve others that supported fraudulent North Korean workers bids to secure employment were also seized and are pictured in an unsealed affidavit [PDF].

The accusations are the latest in a string of privacy-related scandals for the company, including a 2022 incident in which the site\u2019s data sharing practices reportedly led to the outing of a senior Catholic church official as a Grindr user.\nKelly Peterson Miranda took over as Grindr\u2019s chief privacy officer in January 2023 following the departure of Ronald De Jesus, who has alleged that the company stored user data, including photos and videos, after people deleted their accounts \u2014 a violation of the app\u2019s privacy policy. De Jesus has accused Grindr of rampant privacy abuses and is suing the company for wrongful termination. In October the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a leading advocacy group, appealed to the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the app for its history of alleged privacy abuses.\nMiranda asserts that the pioneering app\u2019s privacy practices are far more rigorous than its competitors. In an interview with Recorded Future News, Miranda discusses why the HIV-status lawsuit is unfair, how Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is discriminatory and why data minimization is critical to privacy protection.\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nRECORDED FUTURE NEWS: About three weeks ago, Grindr was sued in the U.K. for allegedly sharing users\u2019 private information, including HIV status and the date of the last HIV test, with third parties without consent. Did this happen as plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys allege?\nKELLY PETERSON MIRANDA: In the lawsuit they allege that we sold health information \u2014 HIV last-tested date \u2014 and used it for advertising purposes, which categorically I can say no, that never happened. We have never used users\u2019 health-related information for any type of advertising purposes as purported in the lawsuit. The activity that they described in the lawsuit we believe is a mischaracterization of practices that happened two management teams ago, and we will defend ourselves vigorously against those claims.\nThe information was shared with two service providers for the purposes of rolling the features out and this all predated my employment with the company. It was characterized as a breach back in pre-2018 or early 2018. It was never a breach, it was never shared unknowingly. It was shared in encrypted manners for the purposes of actually rolling out and monitoring the feature.\nRFN: What was the feature?\nKPM: HIV, the ability for users to input that information and have it as a part of their profile. It never got to parties who were never intended to receive the information. We no longer work with those third parties and those third parties have since expunged the data from their systems as well. [Editor\u2019s Note: Grindr users can still list their HIV status publicly, if they choose.]\nRFN: Nonetheless, do you see the sharing of HIV information with third parties as a breach of users\u2019 trust? Did your privacy policy warn users that such data sharing was possible?\nKPM: We always disclose, even today if you look at the privacy policy, the potential for that information to be shared with limited service providers. I think that most people have an understanding that no company operates in a vacuum by itself. There are contractors or service providers that we work with to offer the services. So today we explicitly state that this information is shared with those service providers who have a requirement to need access. We've always been transparent with regards to the use of third parties and the data that third parties may need to have access to in order to help us provide the services.\nRFN: Have you changed your privacy practice at least on sharing HIV-related information with third parties?\nKPM: The position hasn't changed because \u2014 the same as it is today \u2014 it's only ever shared with those third parties who we have to in order to provide the service. There was a lot of mischaracterization that it was shared for advertising purposes or monetization purposes and we've never shared information with third parties in order to do anything other than make it available for users to display in their profile.\nRFN: And that's true across the board, not just with HIV status?\nKPM: We've always disclosed what information may be shared for certain purposes. There were some changes that were made after I came on board where we stopped sharing certain pieces of profile information for advertising purposes such as age and gender. [Now, what we share] for advertising purposes is very limited. It's a mobile ad ID if the user consents to that being shared.\nRFN: Is consent just based on a privacy policy being shared or is it affirmative consent?\nKPM: It\u2019s affirmative consent in the EU. The consent is dependent on where the user lives, but all users have the option to go in and either opt in or opt out of personalized ads, which will then determine what information is or is not shared.\nHistorically, fields like age and gender may have been shared. Today all that is shared with advertisers is a mobile ad ID if the user consents to that being shared, some basic phone information for the ad to be served \u2014 the phone type and size so that the ad will render correctly \u2014 an IP address because that is required, that's how information is sent across the internet. So no profile information. No location information. No personal information beyond the mobile ad ID is shared today.\nRFN: In 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported that Grindr sold location data to ad networks resulting in the outing of a senior official [Monsignor Jeffrey Burrill] with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Back then it seems that location data was shared.\nKPM: That's accurate because it was industry practice to share location data as a part of an ad bid request at the time. That's another change that was put in place \u2014 location information is no longer shared.\nRFN: Does Grindr regret that that happened?\nKPM: We dispute that the information that led to Monsignor Burrill's dismissal was Grindr information because it has never been proven. We asked repeatedly for the underlying data so that we could run our own analysis to understand where it came from because the information that was in [an article by the publication Pillar] was much more broad and vast than what Grindr would have, and so we suspect that this was actually data that was packaged at the network level, and not actually Grindr data. It's not been proven today as far as we know that it is Grindr data that led to his dismissal.\nThe mobile phone company has access to much more data than what Grindr ever collected or used for advertising purposes. The amount of data that was used and discussed in that Pillar article goes beyond what Grindr would ever have held or collected on users.\nRFN: You were also fined by the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (DPA) in 2021 for illegally sharing private user data with at least five advertising firms and had to pay nearly $12 million to resolve the decision. Do you believe that the fine also was unfair?\nKPM: We do believe the fine was unfair because we're still fighting it in court. I was just in Norway in March for the hearing where we are suing to have the decision overturned and the fine overturned as well. The basis of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority\u2019s claim is that we did not collect proper consent or the right level of consent to share the users\u2019 data for advertising purposes which we disagree with.\nThen the decision goes even further to what we believe is a discriminatory decision where they state that all Grindr user data is sensitive, or what we call Article 9 data, which means under the GDPR you have several different what we call legal bases \u2014 you have to have a legal basis in order to collect and process information. For non-sensitive data it can be things like performance of contract, it can be legitimate interest, it can also be consent. But once data moves over into the sensitive or special category data, the only legal basis a company can use to collect and process is consent.\nWhat the Norwegian DPA has said is that Grindr, because of the app name and who we are, all of our users\u2019 data, all the data that we collect \u2014 so things such as age, height, an interest in brunch or hobbies \u2014 is sensitive data because of the app that we are.\nThe user would be required to give affirmative consent for every single piece of information, every chat message that is sent, every video call that\u2019s made.\nRFN: So in other words a popup each time saying, \u201cdo you consent?\u201d\nKPM: Yes.\nRFN: When you say that's discriminatory, you mean because they are applying that only to Grindr as opposed to other dating apps because you cater to LGBTQ+ populations?\nKPM: Yes. They're saying that we know the sexual orientation of all of our users which we don't. We don't even ask that question. Other companies who are collecting more or the same type of information don't have that barrier of consent to adhere to just because they cater to a broader audience. It\u2019s going to disproportionately impact service providers like Grindr who are a service to a certain community.\nRFN: Last month you published a blog post saying Grindr understands some of its users live in one of the 60-plus countries where being gay is a crime and that your \u201ccommitment to privacy goes beyond mere compliance. It's the fundamental promise we make to each and every user.\u201d Do you worry that your users don\u2019t trust you?\nKPM: I am dedicated to making sure that we tell our story about all of our controls and our philosophical approach to privacy so that users understand. Unfortunately, throughout Grindr\u2019s history, there have been headlines such as what you mentioned and they always come out and then they disappear. The end result is rarely ever reported on which is that there may be some questions asked and ultimately no illegal or deceptive tactics were found.\nIt starts with data minimization which is a key privacy principle and so we require as little information as possible for someone to use our services. Users have options on what they provide. They also remain in control of whether information stays in their profile or not. It can be erased at any time. So to establish a Grindr account they need a sign up mechanism of some sort whether that's an email, a phone number or a social login and an age to verify that they're old enough to use the services. Beyond that, everything else is really at the user's discretion. We don't collect full legal name. We don't require anyone to fill out the totality of their profile. We haven't even nudged users to fill out the totality of their profiles.\nRFN: Who are your advertising partners?\nKPM: You can see all of our advertising partners. They\u2019re listed in our privacy policy. They're also listed in the CMP that users see, that full screen takeover that I said, but our current ad partners are companies such as Google AdMob, PubMatic, Vungle. We work with eight ad partners right now.\nRFN: Have you thought about just not sharing any data with ad partners?\nKPM: We already share the least amount of data possible. If someone opts out we don\u2019t share any personal information. So the only piece of personal information right now that\u2019s shared with consent is a mobile ad ID. That's it. Everything else is device related information in order to just show an ad.\nRFN: But mobile ad IDs can be used to connect people through other data that's in the marketplace to figure out who they are.\nKPM: So there is that possibility, but users also have the ability to reset their mobile ad ID so it's not a persistent identifier and that's controlled at the phone, at the operating system level. Apple a few years ago came out with what they call the app tracking and transparency policy. If a user opts out of ad tracking at the device level on an iPhone, we as Grindr don't even get the mobile ad ID so it's impossible for us to pass along an ID because we don't even get it. I would say that we see about 70% or so of our iPhone users opt out at the device level so there's not even a possibility for us to pass a mobile ad ID.\nRFN: But you could choose to just not work with any ad partners at all? I realize that would go far beyond what the rest of the sector is doing, but that would be something you could choose to do?\nKPM: There would be nothing to subsidize the free version of the service so to offset that we would have to charge a subscription fee to every user.\nRFN: The former Grindr chief privacy officer Ronald De Jesus has said he was fired after alerting executives to rampant violations of the company privacy policy. He said that Grindr stores users\u2019 private data, including photos and messages, after they delete their accounts. Is that true?\nKPM: No, I can tell you as chief privacy officer data is expunged or deleted in accordance with our retention schedule or when a user deletes their account as outlined in our privacy policy.\nRFN: How would you characterize what you're doing on privacy compared to the rest of the dating app sector?\nKPM: It all goes back to data minimization. I think other apps are looking to collect as much information as possible and are nudging users to complete profiles, to upload photos, to give more information throughout the user journey. We value user choice in allowing all of that to remain optional \u2014 not requiring photos to use Grindr, not requiring legal names and things of that nature. We are really prioritizing privacy and discretion about data collection.\nSuzanne Smalley\nis a reporter covering privacy, disinformation and cybersecurity policy for The Record.

Labelled \u201cInvestor relations\u201c, it holds links to the documents filed with the London Stock Exchange of their intention to float. In other words, it\u2019s confirmation of their upcoming share offering.\nIt has been interesting to watch the growth of Raspberry Pi over the last twelve years, from cottage industry producing a thousand boards in China, to dominating the SBC market and launching their own successful silicon. Without either a crystal ball or a window into Eben Upton\u2019s mind, we\u2019re as unreliable as anyone else when it comes to divining their future path. But since we\u2019re guessing that it will involve ever more complex silicon with a raspberry logo, it\u2019s obvious that the float will give them the investment springboard they need.\nFor those of us who have been around for a long time this isn\u2019t the first company in our corner of the technology world we\u2019ve seen burn brightly. It\u2019s not even the first from Cambridge. Appointing ourselves as pundits though, we\u2019d say that Raspberry Pi\u2019s path to this point has been surprisingly understated, based upon the strength of its products rather than hype, and while Eben is undoubtedly a well-known figure, not based upon a cult of personality. There is already a significant ecosystem around Raspberry Pi, we\u2019d like to think that this move will only strengthen it. We may not be looking at the British Microsoft, but we don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at another Sinclair either.\n12 thoughts on \u201cRaspberry Pi Files Paperwork With The London Stock Exchange\u201d\nI suppose it was too good to last. It will be embrace-extend-extinguished by a rival tech company fairly quickly. It would be foolish if somebody did not embrace this strategy, although it will be unfortunate for everyone.\nDie a hero or live long enough to become the villain. IMO they\u2019ve been on a spiral for a while and completely lost sight of what made them great to begin with.\nAny bets on how long it\u2019ll take for the company press releases to include the words \u201cincrease shareholder value\u201d?\nWorse than that. Optimistic scenario is that they exclusively manufacture industrial computers at an industrial price point and maybe offer a discount on the table scraps.\nThe raspi foundation rode the goodwill and word of mouth of makers to high-volume production, then prioritized commercial partners at everyone else\u2019s expense. Why? For money.\nNow they\u2019re just taking the facade off, and in the process allowing insiders to cash out. From this point forward it is an undeniable fact that raspi exists to generate money for shareholders, not serve any community. They are not a nonprofit foundation anymore and don\u2019t deserve the goodwill that entails.\nI thought they were non-profit (once).\nThe Raspberry Pi Foundation is the non-profit, and it does a lot of the educational stuff. Once upon a time they were the sole owners of Raspberry Pi Trading, who do all the hardware stuff. This is apparently a common way for charities to firewall themselves from the potential failure of a commercial arm. The Foundation is giving up part of the ownership of Pi Trading, presumably to fund ever more expensive hardware development.\nWait for the enshitification\nYup.\nYe of little faith! I\u2019m not saying they are the next Apple, but chip development can only rarely be funded by a non-profit, and Raspberry Pi has made quite a respectable name for themselves over the past few years, so why not let them \u201cgo public\u201d? When the founders of a company have good values and a good mission statement, it is possible for them to stay on the \u201clight side of the force.\u201d Yes, they will have responsibilities to their shareholders, but what if this is compatible with their mission?\nUntil some vulture capitalist buys them out. Or worse, Phony Stark still has 260 billion or so\u2026\nI hope they\u2019ve thought carefully about how the public company will be controlled and managed. There are certainly examples of public companies that are just rubber stamps for a particular individual\u2019s vision (eg Tesla) and others that despite the best intentions were taken over by commercial interests (eg OpenAI). Whether or not we see a turn away from open source toward just another proprietary chip vendor will depend a lot on how the governance is set up.\nMixed feeling. One hand they should be able to do more things, more products, and get the company on a real growth path. Can be a good thing. On the other hand if they lose the reason for being and concentrate more on commercial products, it will be a loss for the maker/education community. Time will tell! They\u2019ve had a good run so far and I have and do enjoy working with their products.\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Platinsponsor Intel hatte wohl auf Sonnenaufgangsstimmung gehofft, ist doch ihre Exaflops-\"Sonne\" Aurora mit sechs Jahren Versp\u00e4tung nun endlich \u00fcber den Horizont gekommen. Doch so richtige Strahlkraft hat sie offenbar nicht entfaltet. Wenn man auf der ISC \u00fcberhaupt von Aurora mit seinen Intel-Prozessoren und -Beschleunigern sprach, dann zumeist negativ, nicht selten sogar sp\u00f6ttisch. Ist doch seine Energieeffizienz zumindest beim 64-bittigen Linpack-Benchmark im Vergleich zu den AMD- und Nvidia-Systemen eher blamabel. Und die einst mal anvisierten 2 EFlops sind zun\u00e4chst jedenfalls weit verfehlt. Reichlich Optimierungsbedarf fehlt zudem beim HPCG-Benchmark.\nViel mehr Aufmerksamkeit kam so den Grace-Hopper-Systemen mit Nvidia-Prozessoren zuteil, zumal man sie auf der Ausstellung auch in Hardware bewundern konnte, zumeist in Servern mit Boards von Gigabyte.\nHPE-Cray ist bei allen Plattformen ganz vorn dabei. Der Serverbauer zeigte stolz seine Blades, auch die nagelneuen f\u00fcr Grace-Hopper (mit Kunstoffleitungen f\u00fcr die Wasserk\u00fchlung) und Modelle f\u00fcr AMDs Epyc 9004 (Genoa) sowie der neu vorgestellten MI300-Serie. Mit dabei sind auch schon HPE-Racks vom Exascale-Supercomputer El Capitan, die in der Top500-Liste Platz 48 erreichten. El Capitan soll ja wirklich mindestens 2 Exaflops erreichen.\nAber ein Aurora-Blade auf der Veranstaltung? Bei HPE hei\u00dft es: Fragen Sie Intel. Bei Intel: Fragen Sie das Leibniz-Rechenzentrum. Und dort kann man sich tats\u00e4chlich zumindest ein Blade des \"kleinen Aurora\" anschauen, mit vier statt sechs Ponte-Vecchio-Beschleunigern.\nErfahrungen mit Grace-Hopper\nSechs gro\u00dfe Forschungseinrichtungen berichteten \u00fcber ihre ersten Erfahrungen mit Grace-CPUs, sowohl mit als auch ohne angef\u00fcgter Grace-Hopper, und diese waren unisono positiv: die Uni Bristol (Isambard 3), das Los Alamos Lab (Venado), TACC (Vista), CSCS (Alps), J\u00fclich (Jupiter) und das japanische Joint Center for Advanced HPC (Myabi-G). Demnach erwies sich die Portierung der Software als \"relativ einfach\". OpenMPI und andere MPI-Stacks (au\u00dfer Intel) stellten kein Problem dar. Die Japaner empfehlen \u00fcbrigens OpenACC. Ihre Liste erprobter HPC-Applikationen bestand zu 90 Prozent aus Fortran-Programmen und die verwenden zumeist doppelt genaues Gleitkommaformat (FP64). Ob Intel mit seiner Entscheidung, bei Ponte-Vecchio auf doppeltgenaue Matrix-Engines zu verzichten, so richtig lag?\nEin einzelnes Rack des schweizerischen Alps mit 512 Grace-Hopper-Superchips ist f\u00fcr 340 Kilowatt ausgelegt, das Dreifache vom Piz Daint zuvor. Unter Vollast zieht ein Chip 650 Watt \u2013 und da gibts ja noch ein paar mehr Verbraucher. So musste man per Powercapping die Chipleistung auf 570 Watt beschr\u00e4nken. Apropos Energiesparen: im Idle-Betrieb, so das CSCS, sind die Superchips nicht gerade sparsam. Der Rechner zieht mehr als zuvor Piz Daint unter Vollast. Aber ohne Rechenlast sollen die wertvollen Systeme ja nur selten laufen \u2026\nEurop\u00e4ische Prozessoren\nDer Jupiter-Booster mit Grace-Hopper-Superchips soll das erste Exascale-System in Europa werden, und zwar im Rahmen der Supercomputing-Initiative EuroHPC Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU). Mit lediglich einem bislang nur halb best\u00fcckten Rack namens Jupiter Exascale Development Instrument (Jedi), aufgebaut von Eviden, konnte das J\u00fclicher SC schon mal zeigen, was Sache ist \u2013 und \u00fcbernahm die Spitzenposition in puncto Energieeffizienz. Voll best\u00fcckt enth\u00e4lt ein Rack 48 Knoten mit je vier Prozessoren \u2013 insgesamt 140 Racks ergeben fast zwei Millionen ARM-Neoverse-V2-Kerne. Dieser Aufbau soll jetzt voll im Gange sein. Zus\u00e4tzlich ist auch ein Jupiter-Cluster mit 2600 europ\u00e4ischen Prozessoren Rhea-1 von SiPearl geplant (auf Basis des \u00e4lteren ARM Neoverse V1). Aber der l\u00e4sst weiter auf sich warten, von SiPearl h\u00f6rt man dazu nur das \u00fcbliche \"soon\".\nDoch in Europa werden auch noch andere Prozessoren f\u00fcrs High-Performance-Computing entworfen, etwa vom Fraunhofer ITWM in Zusammenarbeit mit dem ETH Z\u00fcrich ein Prozessor speziell als Stencil- und Tensor-Beschleuniger (STX). Eine Vielzahl von Anwendungen k\u00f6nnen davon profitieren, bei Str\u00f6mungsdynamik, in Klima- und Wettervorhersagen bis hin zu bildgebenden Verfahren. Vier solcher STX-Prozessoren kommen auf eine PCIe-5.0-Karte, zusammen mit 64 GByte High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM). Ein jeder f\u00e4hrt ein kleines Linux. Das Konzept ist also ein bisschen \u00e4hnlich dem NEC-Vektorrechner SX-Aurora Tsubasa. Programmiert werden soll er bequem \u00fcber OpenMP-Offloading. Das Design ist bereits fertig, die PCIe-Karte auch, nur die Fertigung der Chips (im 12-Nanometer-Prozess) l\u00e4sst noch auf sich warten. Auch eine Vermarktungsfirma namens UNEEC Systems wurde bereits gegr\u00fcndet, mit dem Chief Strategie Officer von Fraunhofer IWTM, Dr. Franz-Josef Pfreundt als CEO.

Mikro-LEDs f\u00fcr Videow\u00e4nde oder die Instrumentenanzeige im Auto werden gekachelt.\nAuf der Display Week kann man winzige Dioden f\u00fcr Pixelgr\u00f6\u00dfen von wenigen Mikrometern bis zu 100 Mikrometer in hochaufl\u00f6senden gro\u00dfen Displays sehen, darunter bei BOE, Innolux, Samsung und TCL. Die Mikro-LEDs sind aber auch f\u00fcrs Auto interessant, weil sie hohe Temperaturen ebenso aushalten wie Minusgrade.\nGro\u00dfe LED-Schirme werden aus mehreren Kacheln zusammengesetzt, die wiederum die kleinen Mikro-LEDs enthalten. Hierdurch ist man nicht komplett frei in der Wahl der Aufl\u00f6sung, denn die h\u00e4ngt von der Displaygr\u00f6\u00dfe beziehungsweise der Anzahl der aneinandergef\u00fcgten Kacheln ab; letztere haben eine feste Aufl\u00f6sung.\nBeim 106-z\u00f6lligen Mikro-LED-Display von Innolux sind es beispielsweise 96 Kacheln aus 12,3-z\u00f6lligen Platten, die mit 20 x 40 Mikrometer kleinen LEDs f\u00fcr jedes RGB-Subpixel best\u00fcckt wurden. Dabei handelt es sich um blaue LEDs, die mit farbkonvertierenden Quantenpunkten rotes und gr\u00fcnes Licht erzeugen. Die Kunst besteht hier darin, die 96 Bildkacheln so aneinanderzuf\u00fcgen, dass man im Videobetrieb keine \u00dcberg\u00e4nge erkennt. Dazu m\u00fcssen die Kacheln sehr genau farblich aufeinander abgestimmt werden, gleich hell leuchten und es d\u00fcrfen keine Verz\u00f6gerungen in der Ansteuerung auftreten. Innolux ist das bei dem auf der Display Week gezeigten Schirm sehr gut gelungen. Den genannten Kontrast von 8000:1 in heller Umgebung erreicht Innolux mit einer mattierten Kacheloberfl\u00e4che, die wenig Umgebungslicht reflektiert und so f\u00fcr gutes Schwarz sorgt; die superhellen Mikro-LEDs werden bei dunklen Bildinhalten \u00e4hnlich wie OLEDs einfach ausgeschaltet\n.\nDer chinesische Displayhersteller Visionox setzt seine LED-Videow\u00e4nde aus 14,5-z\u00f6lligen LED-Kacheln zusammen, die weniger als 5 Prozent des Umgebungslichts reflektieren. Auch dies erzielt in der hellen Ausstellung sehr gute Schwarzwerte. In den Kacheln leuchten 25 Mikrometer kleine Leuchtdioden, gedacht sind die Module f\u00fcr Kinoleinw\u00e4nde oder Museen.\nIm Auto\nDisplayspezialist BOE demonstriert die Kunst des nahtlosen Aneinanderf\u00fcgens von Mikro-LED-Kacheln an einem Display f\u00fcr die Konsole im Auto. Dort kann man die enorme Helligkeit der winzigen LEDs besonders gut gebrauchen. Da die anorganischen LEDs zudem recht unempfindlich auf Temperaturschwankungen reagieren, dr\u00e4ngen sie sich f\u00fcrs Auto geradezu auf: Im Automobilbereich m\u00fcssen alle Komponenten mindestens Temperaturschwankungen von -40 bis 85 Grad Celsius \u00fcberstehen.

Bist du sicher, dass du gehen willst?\", wenn ein Nutzer Anstalten macht, die Seite zu schlie\u00dfen. Ein klarer Fall der Dark-Patterns-Spielart \"Confirmshaming\", meinte der vzbv. Dabei wird versucht, unangenehme Emotionen wie Schuld, Scham oder die Sorge, etwas zu verpassen, auszul\u00f6sen, um die Entscheidungsfindung der Nutzer zu beeinflussen.\nDer vzbv mahnte den H\u00e4ndler zudem wegen willk\u00fcrlich erscheinender Rabatth\u00f6hen, fehlenden Informationen bei Sternchen-Bewertungen, unvollst\u00e4ndigem Impressum sowie Greenwashing ab. Bei letzterem geht es darum, eigenen Produkten oder Aktivit\u00e4ten eine positive Wahrnehmung zu verschaffen. Konkret kreideten die Verbrauchersch\u00fctzer Shein die Behauptung an, dass ein Abholen von Lieferungen bei einem Paketshop einen positiven Beitrag zum Klima- und Umweltschutz leiste. Der Mode-Anbieter hat alle diese Kritikpunkte einger\u00e4umt und Besserung gelobt.\nShopping mit Suchtfaktor: EU-Rechtsversch\u00e4rfungen angemahnt\nSp\u00e4testens von Ende August an muss Shein auch die strengsten Vorschriften gem\u00e4\u00df dem DSA einhalten. Die EU-Kommission stufte das Portal Ende April offiziell als sehr gro\u00dfe Plattform ein. Deren Betreiber m\u00fcssen Risikoabsch\u00e4tzungen durchf\u00fchren und ausgemachte Gefahren etwa f\u00fcr die Demokratie, die \u00f6ffentliche Sicherheit, die Grundrechte und den Jugendschutz minimieren.\nDass nach Temu auch Shein rasch reagiert habe, zeigt f\u00fcr vzbv-Vorst\u00e4ndin Ramona Pop: \"Verbraucherschutz wirkt.\" Das Unternehmen m\u00fcsse k\u00fcnftig auf die bem\u00e4ngelten Praktiken verzichten. \"Damit haben wir auch dieses Verfahren z\u00fcgig und erfolgreich au\u00dfergerichtlich abgeschlossen\", freut sich Pop. Mit den aktuellen Schritten sei man aber noch nicht am Ziel. Unternehmen wie Shein machten Shopping \"zum Spiel, das s\u00fcchtig machen kann\". Auf solche Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle sei das Verbraucherrecht nicht vorbereitet und brauche dringend ein Update. Pop mahnte die EU daher, \"den digitalen Verbraucherschutz in der kommenden Legislaturperiode ganz oben auf die Agenda\" zu setzen.

A GE Healthcare spokesperson told Recorded Future News that the company has not received any reports that the bugs have been exploited.\nThe Vivid T9 is built for cardiac imaging, but it can also be used as a general-purpose ultrasound system for other parts of the body. Common Service Desktop is an application that facilitates administrative tasks like password changes, logs and more. EchoPAC is a tool doctors use to look at ultrasound images.\nSeven of the vulnerabilities carry severity scores over 7. Nozomi Networks experts said they worked with GE Healthcare to examine the issues.\nThe devices and software are not being recalled, the GE Healthcare spokesperson said. GE Healthcare published two advisories about the issues on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe recently disclosed potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities for several ultrasound systems that, if acted upon, could render a system unusable or disclose limited patient information,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe conducted a thorough investigation of the issue and determined existing mitigations and controls are in place and effective.\u201d\nThe medical device industry has faced increasing pressure to address software and hardware vulnerabilities. Health-ISAC, an information sharing organization for the U.S. healthcare sector, said in a 2023 report that researchers had found nearly 1,000 exploitable bugs in medical products.\nPhysical access needed\nNozomi Networks said that exploitation of the vulnerabilities would require physical interaction with the device because an attacker needs to operate with the embedded keyboard and trackpad.\nThe security company discovered that the Vivid T9 has a fully-fledged desktop PC running a version of Microsoft Windows 10 customized by GE HealthCare embedded inside of it.\nThe 11 vulnerabilities found in Vivid T9, Common Service Desktop and EchoPAC Software would allow a hacker to gain administrative privileges.\n\u201cIn a similar fashion to previous research conducted by Nozomi Networks Labs, we successfully verified the ability to lock the Vivid T9 by means of a proof-of-concept ransomware,\u201d the researchers said.\n\u201cAfter physically accessing the device and removing all Windows security protections (which was possible due to the full privileges obtained), we were able to disrupt the device logic while simultaneously showing a picture on the screen asking for the payment of a ransom. A similar payload may also be executed against a doctor\u2019s workstation running Echopac.\u201d\nThe same access could be used to both access and manipulate patient data on the device.\nA GE HealthCare spokesperson said data stored on ultrasound devices is often limited and that it is not intended as a permanent record-keeping system. In most clinical settings, ultrasound systems are located in a secure environment where they cannot be accessed by outsiders, the spokesperson said.\nJonathan Greig\nis a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

Dazu kommen erh\u00f6hte Abgaben f\u00fcr Hafenkr\u00e4ne und Medizinprodukte.\nUS-Wahlkampfget\u00f6se oder Handelskrieg\nHandelt es sich bei diesen Strafma\u00dfnahmen der US-Regierung um Aktionismus, der dem beginnenden Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlkampf geschuldet ist? Der voraussichtliche Kandidat der Republikaner, Donald Trump, bei Sanktionen gegen chinesische Unternehmen einschl\u00e4gig erfahren, forderte umgehend noch weiter gehende Ma\u00dfnahmen. Oder ist es der Auftakt zu einem neuen Handelskrieg zwischen den Wirtschaftsgro\u00dfm\u00e4chten USA und China, bei dem Europa massiv mitbetroffen w\u00e4re?\nDer Entscheidung der US-Regierung liegt eine umfangreiche Bestandsaufnahme zugrunde. Die US-Handelsbeauftragte Katherine Tai (USTR) beschreibt in ihrer Bestandsaufnahme der Sanktionen gegen China, wie und warum die Volksrepublik sich nicht an Prinzipien des Welthandels halte und sich auf unfairen Wegen Vorteile verschaffe.\nDie Liste der Vorw\u00fcrfe ist lang: Vom klassischen Spionagefall eines Mitarbeiters der chinesischen Staatssicherheit in den USA, den Technologietransfer durch Joint Ventures bis hin zur Wirtschaftsspionage durch die als staatsnah eingestufte chinesische Gruppierung APT27, auf die auch der deutsche Verfassungsschutz aufmerksam gemacht hatte. \"Statt grunds\u00e4tzliche Reformen anzugehen, ist die Volksrepublik dabei geblieben und in einigen F\u00e4llen sogar aggressiver geworden\", hei\u00dft es in einer Mitteilung der USTR.\nDer US-Regierung geht es um mehrere Ziele. Batterieelektrische Fahrzeuge (BEV) aus China spielen bislang nur eine kleine Rolle auf dem US-Markt. Knapp 10 Prozent aller von Januar bis April in den USA verkauften Autos haben einen elektrischen Antrieb, weniger als ein Drittel davon stammt aus China. Der Vorsto\u00df der US-Regierung l\u00e4sst sich also eher mit aktuellen Entwicklungen und mittelfristigen Erwartungen erkl\u00e4ren: Chinas Hersteller unterbieten sich derzeit massiv bei den Preisen, w\u00e4hrend die Exportkapazit\u00e4t parallel zunimmt.\nChinesische Reedereien und Autokonzerne investieren derzeit nicht zuletzt in Autotransporter \u2013 Cosco allein, so berichteten es chinesische Medien, habe 24 gro\u00dfe sogenannte Roll-on-Roll-off-Schiffe (RoRo) in Auftrag gegeben, der chinesische Autohersteller BYD peilt acht derartige Schiffe an \u2013 die \"Explorer No. 1\" brachte im Februar 3000 Fahrzeuge nach Bremerhaven. Der Aussto\u00df der chinesischen Autobauer zielt auf den Weltmarkt \u2013 und dazu geh\u00f6ren zumindest perspektivisch auch die USA. Dem m\u00f6chte die US-Regierung fr\u00fchzeitig einen Riegel vorschieben.\nEU-Verfahren l\u00e4uft noch\nAuch in der EU gibt es eine intensive Diskussion dar\u00fcber, ob China mit Subventionen f\u00fcr seine Autohersteller den Markt verzerrt und sich so unfair Wettbewerbsvorteile verschafft. Eine entsprechende Untersuchung der EU-Kommission ist im Oktober angelaufen, Ergebnisse liegen noch nicht vor. Allerdings sprach die EU-Kommission Anfang Mai eine deutliche Warnung aus: BYD, SAIC und Geely h\u00e4tten bislang nicht die erforderlichen Unterlagen beigebracht.\nSollte die EU-Kommission Strafen verh\u00e4ngen, k\u00f6nnten diese auch r\u00fcckwirkend gelten. 20 Prozent der in Januar und Februar in der EU registrierten BEV stammen laut den Marktforschern von JATO aus chinesischer Produktion, 33 Prozent hingegen aus deutschen Fabriken. Allerdings gibt es einen gro\u00dfen Unterschied zwischen den USA und der EU: Viele Elektrofahrzeuge, die in China hergestellt werden, geh\u00f6ren zu europ\u00e4ischen Marken.\nGenau das sieht auch Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (SPD) als einen ma\u00dfgeblichen Unterschied, wie er am Dienstag erkl\u00e4rte: Er wolle darauf hinweisen, dass \"50 Prozent der Importe von Elektrofahrzeugen aus China von westlichen Marken kommen, die selber dort produzieren und nach Europa importieren.\" Zudem w\u00fcrden europ\u00e4ische Hersteller in China und nach China erfolgreich verkaufen. \"Das ist vielleicht auch ein Unterschied bei der Betrachtung\", meinte der Kanzler.\nDass die USA das anders sehen, daraus machen Wei\u00dfes Haus und Handelsministerium kein Geheimnis: Die Biden-Regierung hatte in den vergangenen beiden Jahren massiv auf Investitionen in den USA gesetzt, um Produktionskapazit\u00e4ten f\u00fcr eine Vielzahl an Industrien aufzubauen.

Drei Jahre sp\u00e4ter gibt es aber nur einen Trend: nach oben.\nDer Hype rund um k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz l\u00e4sst den Aussto\u00df von klimasch\u00e4dlichen Gasen bei Microsoft in die H\u00f6he schnellen. Vom Juli 2022 bis Ende Juni 2023 (Fiskaljahr 2023) hat die Firma Emissionen in H\u00f6he von 15,4 Millionen metrischen Tonnen CO\u2082-\u00c4quivalente verursacht. Die Entwicklung zeigt sich damit kontr\u00e4r zum Plan, bis 2030 klimaneutral zu werden.\nDiesen Plan hat Microsoft im Jahr 2020 gefasst. Als Basislinie zieht die Firma das Gesch\u00e4ftsjahr 2020 heran, in dem Microsoft je nach Rechnung f\u00fcr 11,9 Millionen bis 12,3 Millionen Tonnen CO\u2082-\u00c4quivalente verantwortlich war. Binnen dreier Jahre stieg der Aussto\u00df jetzt auf 15,4 Millionen bis 17,2 Millionen Tonnen CO\u2082-\u00c4quivalente \u2013 ein Plus von 29 beziehungsweise 40 Prozent.\nParallel stieg der Wasserverbrauch von knapp 4,2 Millionen auf gut 7,8 Millionen Kubikmeter. Der Strombedarf, gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils zum Betrieb der Rechenzentren, ist innerhalb der drei Jahre f\u00f6rmlich explodiert \u2013 von 11.284 auf 24.008 Gigawattstunden. Der Gro\u00dfteil davon (98 Prozent) stammt immerhin aus zugekauftem \u00d6kostrom.\nIm Gespr\u00e4ch mit Bloomberg r\u00e4umt Microsoft-Pr\u00e4sident Brad Smith ein, dass der Anstieg an \"neuen Technologien\" liegt. Ma\u00dfgeblich ist damit Hardware gemeint, die f\u00fcr das Training und den Einsatz von KI-Algorithmen notwendig ist. Microsoft stellt etwa ein Rechenzentrum f\u00fcr OpenAIs ChatGPT bereit.\nPotenzial f\u00fcr noch mehr klimasch\u00e4dliche Gase\nDie Statistik k\u00f6nnte noch schlechter aussehen, denn die unzureichende Verf\u00fcgbarkeit von Nvidias KI-Beschleuniger H100 hat ma\u00dfgeblich den Bau neuer Rechenzentren limitiert. Hyperscaler wie Microsoft h\u00e4tten noch mehr Rechenkapazit\u00e4t aufgebaut, h\u00e4tten sie die Hardware daf\u00fcr bekommen.\nEin weiterer Anstieg durch neue Hardware spiegelt sich schon jetzt in den Gesch\u00e4ftszahlen wider: In den ersten drei Quartalen des Fiskaljahres 2024 waren die Investitionsausgaben (Capital Expenditure, CapEx) mit 36,7 Milliarden US-Dollar bereits h\u00f6her als im gesamten Fiskaljahr 2023 (31,9 Milliarden). Das Geld gibt Microsoft gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils f\u00fcr den Bau von Rechenzentren und den Kauf von Serverhardware aus.\nBau und Betrieb von Rechenzentren\nMicrosoft unterscheidet bei den Emissionen zwischen direkt und indirekt verursachten Ausst\u00f6\u00dfen. Die direkt Verursachten machten dank des \u00d6kostroms mit gerade einmal 3,5 Prozent nur einen winzigen Teil aus und sanken innerhalb der letzten drei Jahre. Indirekt machen drei Posten den gr\u00f6\u00dften Teil aus: Kapitalg\u00fcter (38,24 Prozent), die Herstellung gekaufter G\u00fcter und Dienstleistungen (36,23 Prozent) und die Verwendung verkaufter Produkte (14,05 Prozent).\nIm Klartext: Die gekauften KI-Beschleuniger und Prozessoren werden mit klimasch\u00e4dlichen Gasen hergestellt, die teilweise in die Atmosph\u00e4re entweichen. Dazu z\u00e4hlt etwa die \"Ewigkeitschemikalie\" Hexafluorethan (C2F6), dessen Treibhauspotenzial rund das 12.000-fache der gleichen Menge Kohlendioxid (CO2) betr\u00e4gt; ein Kilogramm Hexafluorethan in der Atmosph\u00e4re wirkt also so sch\u00e4dlich wie mehr als 12 Tonnen CO\u2082. Einige Ewigkeitschemikalien lassen sich bisher nicht aus der Chipproduktion verbannen, weil sie unter anderem f\u00fcr hochpr\u00e4zise \u00c4tzschritte notwendig sind.\nMicrosoft ben\u00f6tigt f\u00fcr den Bau seiner Rechenzentren zudem eine erhebliche Menge Beton und Stahl. K\u00fcnftig will die Firma auf klimafreundlich hergestellte Varianten umschwenken.\nProjekte zum Klimaschutz sollen die Bilanz derweil langfristig verbessern. Durch aktuell gef\u00f6rderte Umweltprojekte sollen in den n\u00e4chsten 15 Jahren gut f\u00fcnf Millionen Tonnen CO\u2082 gebunden werden. Dazu z\u00e4hlen die Aufforstung verschiedener Regionen und im kleinen Rahmen Anlagen, die CO\u2082 aus der Luft binden.\n(mma)", "hash": "42d36791964d274c25b49eda504c4e3d911573ab8641583ba6b25efbe6a2ebea", "id": "d07379ec-d839-419f-82f9-4b2839a1d5d5", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Microsoft-KI-laesst-Emissionen-um-bis-zu-40-Prozent-steigen-9722941.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-17T17:16:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "b54a3c1b-3cfd-4a5a-839e-a321ce047802", "title": "Microsoft: KI l\u00e4sst Emissionen um bis zu 40 Prozent steigen"}], "tags": {"Bloomberg": {"name": "Bloomberg", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Brad Smith": {"name": "Brad Smith", "tag_type": "PER"}, "CO\u2082": {"name": "CO\u2082", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CapEx": {"name": "CapEx", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "US-Dollar": {"name": "US-Dollar", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Microsoft: KI l\u00e4sst Emissionen um bis zu 40 Prozent steigen"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T17:11:17.488582", "id": "83ef0da5-c2db-49cc-a3d8-8b42dc324e21", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "11"}, {"created": "2024-05-17T17:08:43.403570", "id": "927af434-b7b7-4e0a-914c-da9b70023999", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-17T16:43:35", "id": "fffd53ce-b9f4-4c81-9a35-9926c346c938", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Jetzt ist auch Twitter.com Geschichte\nElon Musks Online-Netzwerk X hat sich einen Schritt weiter vom fr\u00fcheren Namen Twitter getrennt.

From a report: The Register has learned from those involved in the browser trade that Apple has limited the development and testing of third-party browser engines to devices physically located in the EU. That requirement adds an additional barrier to anyone planning to develop and support a browser with an alternative engine in the EU.\nIt effectively geofences the development team. Browser-makers whose dev teams are located in the US will only be able to work on simulators. While some testing can be done in a simulator, there's no substitute for testing on device -- which means developers will have to work within Apple's prescribed geographical boundary. Prior to iOS 17.4, Apple required all web browsers on iOS or iPadOS to use Apple's WebKit rendering engine. Alternatives like Gecko (used by Mozilla Firefox) or Blink (used by Google and other Chromium-based browsers) were not permitted. Whatever brand of browser you thought you were using on your iPhone, under the hood it was basically Safari. Browser makers have objected to this for years, because it limits competitive differentiation and reduces the incentive for Apple owners to use non-Safari browsers.\nIt effectively geofences the development team.

So wurde das Europol Platform for Experts (EPE) gehackt. Das FBI und Strafverfolger haben das Breach-Forum \u00fcbernommen und das BSI verklagt Microsoft auf Herausgabe von Informationen im Kontext des Storm-0558 Cloud-Hacks. Zudem gab es einige Ransomware-F\u00e4lle (Polizeihochschule, Landmaschinenhersteller etc.).\nAnzeige\nPortal Europol Platform for Experts (EPE) gehackt\nEuropol ist ja die europ\u00e4ische Polizeibeh\u00f6rde der Europ\u00e4ischen Union mit Sitz im niederl\u00e4ndischen Den Haag. Die Beh\u00f6rde f\u00e4llt schon mal auf, dass sie weitgehende Befugnisse zur \u00dcberwachung ihrer B\u00fcrger fordert und massiv Daten sammeln will. Problem, was ich so sehe: Die Beh\u00f6rde hat die eigene Datensicherheit nicht im Griff. So sind der Beh\u00f6rde Personalakten \"abhanden gekommen\", die teilweise sp\u00e4ter \"auf der Stra\u00dfe\" von einem B\u00fcrger gefunden wurden. Ich hatte das im Beitrag Sicherheitsvorf\u00e4lle M\u00e4rz/April 2024 (Stand 9.4.2024) erw\u00e4hnt. Nun wurde der n\u00e4chste Vorfall bekannt, denn das Europol-Portal Platform for Experts (EPE) wurde gehackt.\nIn obigem Tweet wird auf den Beitrag von Bleeping Computer zum Thema hingewiesen \u2013 auch auf Politico findet sich dieser Beitrag. Die Kollegen von Golem hatten zeitnah diesen deutschsprachigen Artikel zum Thema ver\u00f6ffentlicht.\nFBI \u00fcbernimmt Breach Forum\nDie Tage gab es auch eine Beschlagnahmeaktion des FBI und internationaler Strafverfolger, die das sogenannte Breach Forum \u00fcbernommen haben. In diesem Forum wurden abgezogene Daten aus Hacks und erfolgreichen Cyberangriffen gehandelt. Die Kollegen von Bleeping Computer haben in diesem Artikel einige Details zusammen getragen.\nBSI klagt gegen Microsoft auf Offenlegung\nEs ist ein besonderes Schmankerl: Microsoft hat ja k\u00fcrzlich die Backen m\u00e4chtig aufgeblasen, dass man jetzt wirklich was in Sachen Security macht \u2013 ich hatte die Ausf\u00fchrungen des Microsoft-Managements (mit einer Prise Skepsis) im Blog-Beitrag Microsoft macht ab sofort Security zur Top Priorit\u00e4t reflektiert.\nWie so etwas praktisch ausgeht, wenn es um die Aufarbeitung der eklatanten Sicherheitsvorf\u00e4lle bei Microsoft im Sommer 2023 (siehe u.a. R\u00fcffel f\u00fcr Microsoft: Kaskade an Fehlern f\u00fcr Storm-0558 Cloud-Hack verantwortlich) geht, l\u00e4sst sich an obigem Tweet ablesen. Das Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik hat ein offizielles Verfahren gegen Microsoft eingeleitet, um Informationen zu dessen Sicherheitsvorkehrungen zu bekommen. Das Ganze scheint seit Ende 2023 zu laufen, \u00a77a des BSI-Gesetzes gibt der Beh\u00f6rde die Handhabe dazu, schreibt heise in diesem Beitrag, der noch einige Details enth\u00e4lt.\nLaut heise sei die Information durch ein Leak aus dem Digitalausschuss des Bundestags bekannt. Anke Domscheit Berg geht in diesem Podcast vom 26. April 2024 auf die Thematik ein, dass das BSI die Herausgabe von Informationen von Microsoft rechtlich erzwingen musste. L\u00e4uft. Ich hatte seinerzeit bei Microsoft und beim BfDI, Ulrich Kelber nachgefragt, war aber gegen eine Wand gelaufen. Die Ergebnisse sind in den Blog-Beitr\u00e4gen Antworten von Microsoft zum Hack der Microsoft Azure-Cloud durch Storm-0558 \u2013 Teil 1 und Antwort vom BfDI, Ulrich Kelber, zum Hack der Microsoft Azure-Cloud durch Storm-0558 \u2013 Teil 2 nachzulesen.\nAnzeige\nCyberangriff auf Landtechnikhersteller Lemke\nEin Blog-Leser hat mich gestern auf Twitter in einer PM auf den Cyberangriff auf den Landtechnikhersteller Lemke aufmerksam gemacht. Laut Pressemitteilung ist das in Alpen residierende Unternehmen, dass auf die Produktentwicklung, Produktion und den Vertrieb von Landtechnik spezialisiert ist und knapp 1.700 Mitarbeiter hat, am Samstag, den 11. Mai 2024, von Hackern angegriffen geworden. Das Unternehmen gibt an, das die Sicherheitssysteme sofort angeschlagen h\u00e4tten \u2013 die IT-Systeme seien zum Schutz heruntergefahren worden. .\nBetroffen sind alle Standorte \u2013 die Produktion ist eingestellt. Angestellte im B\u00fcrobereiche k\u00f6nnen mobil arbeiten. Momentan arbeiten externe Spezialisten an der Aufarbeitung des Falls und die Gesch\u00e4ftspartner seien auch informiert worden. Zwischen den Zeilen lese ich, dass es mutma\u00dflich einen Ransomware-Befall gegeben haben k\u00f6nnte, bei dem dann auch Daten abgeflossen sein k\u00f6nnten.\nRansomwareangriff auf Polizei-Hochschule in Hessen\nAuf eine Polizei-Hochschule in Hessen (hessische Hochschule f\u00fcr \u00f6ffentliches Management und Sicherheit, H\u00f6MS) hat es bereits im Februar 2022 einen Angriff mit Ransomware gegeben. Es kann nicht ausgeschlossen werden, dass dabei auch pers\u00f6nliche Daten abgeflossen sind, die bis ins Jahr 2010 zur\u00fcckreichen. Jetzt werden Betroffene gewarnt. Die Redaktion von heise hat in diesem Artikel einige Details ver\u00f6ffentlicht.\nAustralische Regierung warnt vor Datenleck\nIn Australien hat es wohl eine Warnung der Regierung vor einem \"gro\u00df angelegten Ransomware-Datenleck\" gewarnt, der Gesundheitsdaten im Land betrifft. Beim Gesundheitsdienstleister MediSecure hat es einen Ransomware-Befall gegeben, bei dem \"die pers\u00f6nlichen und gesundheitlichen Daten von Einzelpersonen\" betroffen sind. MediSecure teilte mit, dass \"erste Anzeichen darauf hindeuten, dass der Vorfall von seiner unserer Drittanbieter ausging\". The Record Media hat die Details in diesem Artikel zusammen getragen.\nAktiv ausgenutzte L\u00fccke in D-Link-Routern\nDie US-Beh\u00f6rde f\u00fcr Cybersicherheit und Infrastruktursicherheit (CISA) hat am Donnerstag zwei Sicherheitsl\u00fccken CVE-2014-100005, CVE-2021-40655 in der Firmware von D-Link-Routern in ihren KEV-Katalog (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) aufgenommen, da es Hinweise auf eine aktive Ausnutzung gibt. The Hacker News hat in diesem Beitrag einige Informationen zusammen getragen.\nSchwachstellen in HP Poly CCX IP-Telefonen\nKeine Ahnung, ob bei der Leserschaft HP Poly CCX IP-Telefone im Einsatz sind. Dort erlauben \u00e4ltere Firmware-Versionen eine unerlaubten Zugriff, was aber durch ein Update behoben werden kann. heise hatte das Thema vor einigen Wochen in diesem Beitrag aufgegriffen.\nChatGPT und ausgenutzte Schwachstellen\nNoch ein zweiter Nachtrag, den ich hier rein kippe. Sicherheitsforscher hatten sich die OpenAI AI-L\u00f6sung ChatGPT darauf hin angesehen, wie diese mit \u00f6ffentlich bekannten Schwachstellen umgehen kann. Beim Test kam heraus, dass ChatGPT die beschriebenen Schwachstellen erfolgreich f\u00fcr Angriffe ausnutzen kann, wie u.a. heise in diesem Beitrag ausf\u00fchrt.\nSicherheitsl\u00fccken in Azure Machine Learning\nVor einiger Zeit bin ich auf diesen Artikel von Trend Micro gesto\u00dfen. Die Botschaft: Sicherheitsl\u00fccken in Azure Machine Learning (AML) erlauben es Angreifern, sich unbemerkt persistent in AML Workspaces festzusetzen. Die Sicherheitsforscher von Trend Micro haben untersucht, wie ein solcher Angriff funktionieren kann und was dagegen zu tun ist.\nWie steht es um S\u00fcdwestfalen IT?\nErinnert sich noch wer an die S\u00fcdwestfalen IT (SIT) und den Ransomware-Angriff im November 2023 (ich hatte letztmalig im Beitrag S\u00fcdwestfalen IT: Chaos ist das neue Normal; Mail f\u00fcr NRW-Verwaltungen wegen Sicherheitsl\u00fccke gestoppt berichtet). Dort wurde bekannt, dass f\u00fcr die 72 Kommunen die Verbandsumlage erh\u00f6ht werden musste, um die finanziellen Folgen der SIT abzufangen.\nB\u00fcrger haben die Nase Voll und klagen nun gegen Kommunen, die ihre IT \u00fcber die S\u00fcdwestfalen IT bereitstellen lie\u00dfen und von dem Cybervorfall betroffen sind. Details finden sich in diesem Beitrag. Und die Stadt Euskirchen konnte im April 2024, sechs Monate nach dem Cyberangriff auf die SIT, erstmalig wieder Kita- und Kita-Verpflegungsbeitr\u00e4ge abbuchen. Die Fachverfahren stehen wieder zur Verf\u00fcgung und die Nacharbeiten sind abgeschlossen. Jens Lange hatte dies auf X in diesem Tweet erw\u00e4hnt.\nCookies blockieren entzieht uns die Finanzierung: Cookie-Einstellungen", "hash": "330624c6eeed7fe726d25d17812db0f8db4622fa9301aea3d51db132e0289471", "id": "df1a1a01-28b1-4cc4-948c-1afa0323367c", "link": "https://www.borncity.com/blog/2024/05/17/sicherheitsmeldungen-17-05-2024/", "osint_source_id": "e091af22-a2b0-4464-9a7d-0176123fd064", "published": "2024-05-17T16:00:15", "source": "https://www.borncity.com/blog/feed/", "story_id": "945e5dde-cb5f-4bf6-912c-baa6b095fb27", "title": "Sicherheitsmeldungen 17.05.2024"}], "tags": {"AML": {"name": "AML", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Alpen": {"name": "Alpen", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Australien": {"name": "Australien", "tag_type": "Country"}, "BSI": {"name": "BSI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "BfDI": {"name": "BfDI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Bundestags": {"name": "Bundestags", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CISA": {"name": "CISA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CVE-2014-100005": {"name": "CVE-2014-100005", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2021-40655": {"name": "CVE-2021-40655", "tag_type": "cves"}, "EPE": {"name": "EPE", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Europol": {"name": "Europol", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Europ\u00e4ischen Union": {"name": "Europ\u00e4ischen Union", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Euskirchen": {"name": "Euskirchen", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "FBI": {"name": "FBI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Hessen": {"name": "Hessen", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Jens Lange": {"name": "Jens Lange", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Lemke": {"name": "Lemke", "tag_type": "PER"}, "MediSecure": {"name": "MediSecure", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "SIT": {"name": "SIT", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Storm-0558": {"name": "Storm-0558", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "S\u00fcdwestfalen": {"name": "S\u00fcdwestfalen", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "S\u00fcdwestfalen IT": {"name": "S\u00fcdwestfalen IT", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Ulrich Kelber": {"name": "Ulrich Kelber", "tag_type": "PER"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Sicherheitsmeldungen 17.05.2024"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T17:23:53.072198", "id": "e8ab6583-ddad-4366-a0a0-c19ea9ca08b6", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "4"}], "created": "2024-05-17T16:00:00", "id": "da29dc98-4a2e-4503-aa94-95b21ef3b233", "news_items": [{"author": "Kai Schmerer", "content": "Ein Balkonkraftwerke (Bestenliste) oder Steckersolarger\u00e4t rechnet sich bereits nach wenigen Jahren (Ratgeber). Aber nur dann, wenn man den selbst erzeugten Strom auch nutzt. Denn \u00fcbersch\u00fcssiger Strom landet zur Freude des lokalen Versorgers kostenlos in dessen Netz, da er anders als bei regul\u00e4ren PV-Anlagen nicht verg\u00fctet wird. Nachdem das Solarpaket I seit wenigen Tagen mit der Verk\u00fcndung im Bundesgesetzblatt in Kraft getreten ist, d\u00fcrfen Balkonkraftwerke bis zu 800 Watt ins Stromnetz einspeisen, was die Problematik noch verst\u00e4rkt. Die L\u00f6sung: Mit einem Stromspeicher k\u00f6nnen Anwender den tags\u00fcber erzeugten Strom speichern und in den Abendstunden nutzen, wenn vom Balkonkraftwerk mangels Sonneneinstrahlung keiner mehr produziert wird. Somit wird der Eigenverbrauch erh\u00f6ht und im g\u00fcnstigsten Fall wird kein Strom mehr verschenkt.\nEinen solchen Solarspeicher bietet Big Blue Energy mit Powafree. Die L\u00f6sung besteht in der Mindestausstattung aus dem Steuerger\u00e4t PV-Route 800 und dem 2,56 kWh fassenden Solarspeicher Cell-Pack 2500. Das Set ist als Nachr\u00fcstl\u00f6sung f\u00fcr ein bestehendes Balkonkraftwerk gedacht und kostet regul\u00e4r 1699 Euro. Aktuell ist es f\u00fcr 853 Euro erh\u00e4ltlich. Der reduzierte Preis wird allerdings erst im Warenkorb angezeigt. Das Angebot gilt noch bis kommenden Dienstag. Wer noch kein Balkonkraftwerk besitzt, kann die Speicherl\u00f6sung auch zusammen mit Solarpanels bestellen. Mit zwei 200-Watt-Panels kostet das Set aktuell 1169 Euro und mit vier 1427 Euro.\nWie gut die winterfeste Stromspeicherl\u00f6sung in der Praxis in Verbindung mit einem Yuma-Balkonkraftwerk (Testbericht) und Hoymiles-Wechselrichter (Bestenliste) HMS-800W-2T funktioniert, zeigt unser Testbericht.\nLieferumfang & Ausstattung\nDas Nachr\u00fcst-Set f\u00fcr bestehende Balkonkraftwerke enth\u00e4lt neben der Steuereinheit PV-Route 800 und dem Stromspeicher Cell-Pack 2500 mit 2,56 kWh Kapazit\u00e4t alle n\u00f6tigen Verbindungskabel, einen MC4-Schl\u00fcssel sowie Montageplatte, Bohrschablone und Schrauben. Ein deutsches Handbuch liegt ebenfalls im Karton. Wer sich vorher informieren m\u00f6chte, kann das PDF nutzen. Das Handbuch informiert ausf\u00fchrlich \u00fcber die Inbetriebnahme des Stromspeichers sowie die wichtigsten Einstellungen der App.\nBig Blue Energy gew\u00e4hrt f\u00fcr die Stromspeicherl\u00f6sung Powafree eine Leistungsgarantie von 10 Jahren. Wenn man das Produkt beim Hersteller registriert, verl\u00e4ngert sich die Garantiezeit um zwei Jahre. Die maximale Einspeiseleistung betr\u00e4gt gesetzeskonforme 800 Watt. Einschr\u00e4nkend ist hingegen die maximale Solarleistung von ebenfalls 800 Watt, da nur zwei Eing\u00e4nge mit maximal je 400 Watt zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen. Damit scheidet das System f\u00fcr Balkonkraftwerke aus, die mit den gesetzlich erlaubten 2000 Watt Solarleistung betrieben werden.\nDie Akkus des Stromspeichers bestehen auf LiFePo4-Zellen, die eine Effizienz von 90 Prozent bieten und bis zu 6000 Ladezyklen ohne Einbu\u00dfen verkraften. Die nutzbare Kapazit\u00e4t betr\u00e4gt etwa 80 Prozent der Nennkapazit\u00e4t, also etwa 2 kWh. Mit der Begrenzung verhindert der Hersteller eine Tiefentladung der Batterie und verl\u00e4ngert somit deren Lebensdauer. Au\u00dferdem dient die Reserve im Winter dazu, die Batterie zu erw\u00e4rmen, wenn die Temperaturen unter null fallen.\nDie Verkabelung ist dank aussagekr\u00e4ftiger Schaubilder und erkl\u00e4rendem Text schnell erledigt. Zun\u00e4chst trennt man den installierten Wechselrichter vom Stromnetz und demontiert mithilfe des MC4-Schl\u00fcssels die Kabel der angeschlossenen Solarpanels. Anschlie\u00dfend verbindet man den Stromspeicher Cell-Pack 2500 mit der Steuereinheit PV-Route 800 unter Verwendung des mitgelieferten Batteriekabels. Mit den im Lieferumfang befindlichen MC4-Kabeln wird dann der Wechselrichter mit der Steuereinheit verbunden. Dann verbindet man den Wechselrichter wieder mit dem Stromnetz. Zum Schluss erfolgt noch der Anschluss der Solarpanels an die Steuereinheit PV-Route 800. Eingeschaltet wird die Anlage mit dem Ein-/Ausschalter an dem Stromspeicher. Ist dieser eingeschaltet, leuchtet der LED-Ring um die Einschalttaste in Blau.\nBig Blue Energy Powafree: Winterfester Stromspeicher mit 2,5 kWh\nBilder\nPowafree: Einsatzf\u00e4hig zwischen \u201320 \u00b0C und +45 \u00b0C\nSowohl PV-Route als auch der Stromspeicher Cell-Pack 2500 sind wetterfest, sodass man den Aufstellort des Systems relativ frei w\u00e4hlen kann. Allerdings sollte die L\u00f6sung nicht direkter Sonneneinstrahlung ausgesetzt sein, da sie nur bis zu einer Temperatur von 45 \u00b0C funktioniert. Wir haben sie unterhalb der in unserem Garten aufgestellten Solarpanels positioniert. Laut Hersteller funktioniert die L\u00f6sung auch im Winter. Dank einer integrierten Heizung soll sie so auch bei bis zu -20\u00b0 C einsatzf\u00e4hig sein. Das konnten wir allerdings nicht \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen, da die Temperaturen w\u00e4hrend der Testperiode im April/Mai nicht unter den Gefrierpunkt gefallen sind.\nF\u00fcr die Steuerung der Stromspeicherl\u00f6sung wird au\u00dferdem noch die App \u201eBigblue Energy\u201c ben\u00f6tigt. Sie liegt f\u00fcr Android und iOS vor, bietet eine deutschsprachige Bedienoberfl\u00e4che und ist auch f\u00fcr Tablets optimiert. F\u00fcr die Nutzung der App ist allerdings eine Registrierung erforderlich.\nPowafree: Inbetriebnahme mit App und Einstellungen\nDie Koppelung des Systems mit der App ist nach nicht mal einer Minute erledigt (siehe Handbuch und Bildergalerie). Die Startseite der App zeigt das gekoppelte Ger\u00e4t. Im Abschnitt \u00dcbersicht zeigt die App den aktuellen Stromfluss. Ganz oben steht die aktuelle Solarleistung, die an die Steuereinheit PV-Route 800 flie\u00dft. Je nach Konfiguration, die man im Abschnitt Einstellungen vorgenommen hat, flie\u00dft der Strom in die Batterie oder/und ins Stromnetz. Unter Status zeigt sich die aktuelle Batteriekapazit\u00e4t in Prozent sowie die Betriebstemperatur. In diesem Abschnitt bietet die App zudem noch Verlaufsdaten zur eingespeisten Strommenge unterteilt in Stunde, Tag, Woche, Monat und Jahr. Ferner zeigt die App auch die gesparten Kosten f\u00fcr Strom (den Tarif stellt man unter Einstellungen ein) nach diesen Perioden sowie die vermiedene CO\u2082-Produktion. Die wichtigsten Konfigurationsparameter stehen unter Einstellungen \u2013 Szenen-Setup zur Verf\u00fcgung. Dort k\u00f6nnen Anwender aus drei Optionen w\u00e4hlen: Ist \u201eVorrang f\u00fcr Batterie\u201c aktiviert, flie\u00dft die gesamte Stromproduktion in den Akku bis dieser geladen ist. Danach wird der Strom ins Netz eingespeist. Mit \u201eMikrowechselrichter priorisieren\u201c wird der erzeugte Strom komplett eingespeist. Die wichtigsten Konfigurationsparameter verbergen sich hinter \u201eBenutzerdefinierte Szene\u201c. Dort kann man mittels drei verschiedenen Tageszeitperioden die H\u00f6he der Einspeiseleistung in 50er-Schritten auf bis zu 800 Watt einstellen. Das entspricht der vom Gesetzgeber maximal m\u00f6glichen Leistung.\nOptimale Einstellung der Einspeiseleistung\nUm keinen Strom zu verschenken, ist es erforderlich, die Einspeiseleistung m\u00f6glichst optimal einzustellen. Es sollte also nicht mehr Strom eingespeist werden, als im Moment ben\u00f6tigt wird. Doch das ist praktisch nahezu unm\u00f6glich. Selbst wenn man etwa einen Drei-Phasen-Stromz\u00e4hler wie den Shelly Pro 3EM im Verteilerkasten installiert hat und den aktuellen Strombedarf kennt, wird man kaum manuell die Einspeiseleistung erh\u00f6hen, nur weil gerade die Hei\u00dfluftfritteuse f\u00fcr wenige Minuten in Betrieb ist. Au\u00dferdem liegt das maximale Einspeiselimit bei 800 Watt, sodass man, selbst bei vollgeladener Batterie, den Leistungsbedarf gro\u00dfer Verbraucher wie Staubsauger, Wasserkocher, Hei\u00dfluftfritteuse oder Sp\u00fclmaschine mit der L\u00f6sung nicht decken kann. Tritt der umgekehrte Fall ein und die Einspeiseleistung \u00fcbersteigt den tats\u00e4chlichen Strombedarf, freut sich der Netzbetreiber \u00fcber den Zufluss von kostenloser Energie. Eine Nulleinspeisung ist mit dem Powafree-Stromspeicher also kaum m\u00f6glich. Aber mithilfe eines Drei-Phasen-Stromz\u00e4hlers erkennt man immerhin den Energiebedarf, sodass man anhand dieser Werte die Einspeiseleistung optimieren kann. Alternativ k\u00f6nnen Nutzer auch smarte Stromsteckdosen (Bestenliste) oder einfache Energiemessger\u00e4te (Ratgeber) verwenden, um den Strombedarf von Verbrauchern zu ermitteln, um aus diesen Daten halbwegs passende Einspeisewerte einstellen zu k\u00f6nnen.\nLaut Hersteller bestehen derzeit keine Pl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr die Integration eines Drei-Phasen-Stromz\u00e4hlers oder anderer L\u00f6sungen, die Daten des aktuellen Strombedarfs liefern, zu integrieren.\nPraxis\nIn der Praxis funktioniert das Powafree im Test mit unserem Yuma-Balkonkraftwerk mit Hoymiles-Wechselrichter (Testbericht) nahezu problemlos. F\u00fcr eine optimale Leistung empfiehlt der Hersteller jedoch Wechselrichter von AP Systems. W\u00e4hrend sich die Hardware keinerlei Fehlfunktion erlaubt und Strom entsprechend den Vorgaben ins Netz einspeist (siehe auch Bildergalerie), gab es mit der Software anfangs Probleme, die aber inzwischen behoben sind. Klar ist aber auch, dass die L\u00f6sung an die Cloud des Herstellers gekoppelt ist. Hat man sie einmal eingerichtet, funktioniert sie auch ohne Cloud und Internet. Doch Zugriff auf Verlaufsdaten gibt es nur mit Internet-Zugang. Allerdings ist das kein Alleinstellungsmerkmal von Big Blue Energy, sondern betrifft viele Hersteller entsprechender L\u00f6sungen.\nSo viel kostet der Stromspeicher Powafree\nBig Blue Energy verlangt f\u00fcr den Stromspeicher Powafree regul\u00e4r knapp 1700 Euro. Aktuell ist die Stromspeicherl\u00f6sung Powafree mit der Steuereinheit PV-Route 800 und dem Akku Cell-Pack f\u00fcr 853 Euro erh\u00e4ltlich. Der reduzierte Preis wird allerdings erst im Warenkorb angezeigt. Das Angebot gilt noch bis kommenden Dienstag. Wer noch kein Balkonkraftwerk besitzt, kann die Speicherl\u00f6sung auch zusammen mit Solarpanels bestellen. Mit zwei 200-Watt-Panels kostet das Set 1169 Euro und mit vier 1427 Euro.\nAlternativen\nWir haben bereits einige Stromspeicher f\u00fcr Balkonkraftwerke getestet und eine Bestenliste erstellt. L\u00f6sungen von Zendure bieten dank einer Kooperation mit Shelly eine bedarfsgerechte Einspeiseleistung. Auch Ecoflow plant eine Zusammenarbeit mit Shelly f\u00fcr sein Powerstream-System. Allerdings sind die Kosten f\u00fcr Stromspeicher mit einer dynamischen Anpassung der Einspeiseleistung, die wir in folgender Tabelle zeigen, deutlich h\u00f6her als die Powafree-L\u00f6sung.\nFazit\nMit Powafree bietet Big Blue Energy einen wetterfesten Solarspeicher f\u00fcr g\u00e4ngige Balkonkraftwerke mit zwei Solarmodulen, der auch bei Minustemperaturen funktioniert. In Verbindung mit der App k\u00f6nnen Anwender die H\u00f6he der Einspeisung des vom Steckersolarger\u00e4t produzierten Strom mittels dreier Szenarien steuern, sodass die Stromernte gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils f\u00fcr die eigene Verwendung genutzt werden kann und nicht kostenlos im Netz des lokalen Energieversorgers landet. Mit einem Preis von aktuell 853 Euro ist Powafree mit einer Nutzkapazit\u00e4t von etwa 2 kWh und einer Garantie von 10 Jahren vergleichsweise g\u00fcnstig.\nEine Nulleinspeisung ist mit der L\u00f6sung allerdings kaum m\u00f6glich: Schlie\u00dflich kann man die Einspeisung nicht an den tats\u00e4chlichen Strombedarf, den man etwa mithilfe eines Drei-Phasen-Stromz\u00e4hlers wie Shelly Pro 3EM (Ratgeber) ermittelt, dynamisch anpassen.

Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's chief scientist and one of the company's cofounders, was named as the colead of this new team. OpenAI said the team would receive 20 percent of its computing power. Now OpenAI's \"superalignment team\" is no more, the company confirms. That comes after the departures of several researchers involved, Tuesday's news that Sutskever was leaving the company, and the resignation of the team's other colead. The group's work will be absorbed into OpenAI's other research efforts.\nSutskever's departure made headlines because although he'd helped CEO Sam Altman start OpenAI in 2015 and set the direction of the research that led to ChatGPT, he was also one of the four board members who fired Altman in November. Altman was restored as CEO five chaotic days later after a mass revolt by OpenAI staff and the brokering of a deal in which Sutskever and two other company directors left the board. Hours after Sutskever's departure was announced on Tuesday, Jan Leike, the former DeepMind researcher who was the superalignment team's other colead, posted on X that he had resigned.\nSutskever's departure made headlines because although he'd helped CEO Sam Altman start OpenAI in 2015 and set the direction of the research that led to ChatGPT, he was also one of the four board members who fired Altman in November.

Microsoft is still gathering customer input for certain scenarios such as break-glass accounts and other special recovery processes,\" explained Azure product manager Naj Shahid.\n\"Students, guest users and other end-users will only be affected if they are signing into Azure portal, CLI, PowerShell or Terraform to administer Azure resources. This enforcement policy does not extend to apps, websites or services hosted on Azure. The authentication policy for those will still be controlled by the app, website or service owners.\"\nMicrosoft also urged admins to enable MFA in their tenants before the rollout using the MFA wizard for Microsoft Entra. They can also monitor which users have registered for MFA using the authentication methods registration report and this PowerShell script to get a report of the MFA state across the entire user base.\nAccording to a Microsoft study focused on analyzing the security performance of MFA methods across a large dataset of Azure Active Directory users exhibiting suspicious activity, MFA offers a big boost of protection for user accounts against cyberattacks, with over 99.99% of all MFA-enabled accounts resisting hacking attempts.\nAs the company's analysts further found, MFA also reduces the risk of compromise by 98.56%, even when the attackers attempted to breach accounts using stolen credentials.\nThis comes after Redmond announced in November that it would soon roll out Conditional Access policies requiring MFA for all admins when signing into Microsoft admin portals (e.g., Entra, Microsoft 365, Exchange, and Azure), for users on all cloud apps, and for high-risk sign-ins (the latter option is only available for Microsoft Entra ID Premium Plan 2 customers).\n\"Our goal is 100 percent multi-factor authentication. Given that formal studies show multi-factor authentication reduces the risk of account takeover by over 99 percent, every user who authenticates should do so with modern strong authentication,\" Weinert said at the time.\nAs part of the same move to boost MFA adoption, Microsoft-owned GitHub also requires all active developers to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) beginning January 2024.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

The Guardian: There is currently \"no realistic or scalable alternative\" to standard kerosene-based jet fuels, and touted \"sustainable aviation fuels\" are well off track to replace them in a timeframe needed to avert dangerous climate change, despite public subsidies, the report by the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive thinktank, found. \"While there are kernels of possibility, we should bring a high level of skepticism to the claims that alternative fuels will be a timely substitute for kerosene-based jet fuels,\" the report said.\nChuck Collins, co-author of the report, said: \"To bring these fuels to the scale needed would require massive subsidies, the trade-offs would be unacceptable and would take resources aware from more urgent decarbonization priorities. It's a huge greenwashing exercise by the aviation industry. It's magical thinking that they will be able to do this.\" In the US, Joe Biden's administration has set a goal for 3bn gallons of sustainable aviation fuel, which is made from non-petroleum sources such as food waste, woody biomass and other feedstocks, to be produced by 2030, which it said will cut aviation's planet-heating emissions by 20%.\nChuck Collins, co-author of the report, said: \"To bring these fuels to the scale needed would require massive subsidies, the trade-offs would be unacceptable and would take resources aware from more urgent decarbonization priorities.

That's fundamentally the problem, people are looking for a panacea that covers all of the use-cases for flying and is low cost, and none exists nor do any appear visible on the horizon.\nThe solution is to whittle-away at the use of air travel where it's practical to do so, using technologies that can be powered through means that don't directly consume fossil fuels and may be powered indirectly through any number of means. For some places this means electrified railroads, even high-speed railroads if the nature of the corridors can justify them. For other places this means working to make electric automotive journeys more practical. But this requires a lot of work and cost.\nFor high-speed rail we've already seen studies that have identified the Boston/DC corridor and the Pacific corridor as potentially viable, and there have been mumblings about a Texas corridor. If the time required isn't massively different than flying due to the headaches of airports and if the passengers have more comfort and the ability to bring more luggage than they can when flying, then suddenly it can become attractive if the costs remain competitive. Which of course will mean understanding that it won't be a profit-maker at first, and possibly not ever. But if that subsidy is the price to pay to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels then so be it.\nRe: (Score:2)\nIf your origin and destination are anywhere near the downtown areas, then NY/Boston can already be faster by rail than air for door-to-door travel time.

General Bureau (RGB), has been observed deploying a Linux version of its GoBear backdoor as part of a campaign targeting South Korean organizations.\nThe backdoor, codenamed Gomir, is \"structurally almost identical to GoBear, with extensive sharing of code between malware variants,\" the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, said in a new report. \"Any functionality from GoBear that is operating system-dependent is either missing or reimplemented in Gomir.\"\nGoBear was first documented by South Korean security firm S2W in early February 2024 in connection with a campaign that delivered a malware called Troll Stealer (aka TrollAgent), which overlaps with known Kimsuky malware families like AppleSeed and AlphaSeed.\nA subsequent analysis by the AhnLab Security Intelligence Center (ASEC) revealed that the malware is distributed via trojanized security programs downloaded from an unspecified South Korean construction-related association's website.\nThis includes nProtect Online Security, NX_PRNMAN, TrustPKI, UbiReport, and WIZVERA VeraPort, the last of which was previously subjected to a software supply chain attack by the Lazarus Group in 2020.\nSymantec said that it also observed the Troll Stealer malware being delivered via rogue installers for Wizvera VeraPort, although the exact distribution mechanism by which the installation packages get delivered is presently unknown.\n\"GoBear also contains similar function names to an older Springtail backdoor known as BetaSeed, which was written in C++, suggesting that both threats have a common origin,\" the company noted.\nThe malware, which supports capabilities to execute commands received from a remote server, is also said to be propagated through droppers that masquerade as a fake installer for an app for a Korean transport organization.\nIts Linux counterpart, Gomir, supports as many as 17 commands, allowing its operators to perform file operations, start a reverse proxy, pause command-and-control (C2) communications for a specified time duration, run shell commands, and terminate its own process.\n\"This latest Springtail campaign provides further evidence that software installation packages and updates are now among the most favored infection vectors for North Korean espionage actors,\" Symantec said.\n\"The software targeted appears to have been carefully chosen to maximize the chances of infecting its intended South Korean-based targets.\"", "hash": "2780d6fc54152db7fcc24a6969b7db9ba009ce9e4a2265c7edaaa6c43157d141", "id": "d4f85ceb-3c07-419d-bb5a-c8abeace34b5",

challenge lies in our ability to comprehend and engage with it seamlessly. My colleague Muazma has shed light on this topic in her insightful blog: \u201cChat with your data in Azure SQL Database,\u201d.\n \nInspired by her work, I pondered the possibility of applying similar principles to SQL Server on Linux VMs hosted on Azure. This blog is a result of that contemplation and here are the steps that we cover in this blog:\n\nWe\u2019ll begin by setting up a Linux-based Virtual Machine on Azure and proceed to install SQL Server on it.\nNext, we\u2019ll implement TLS 1.2 encryption to secure connections to SQL Server, utilizing certbot for certificate creation with Let\u2019s Encrypt serving as the certificate authority.\nWe\u2019ll then import Kaggle\u2019s dataset into SQL Server using the Import Flat File wizard.\nFollowing that, we\u2019ll create the Azure AI service and associated indexes, with the Azure SQL Server on Linux VM as the data source.\nLastly, we\u2019ll utilize Azure OpenAI studio to interact with the data.\n\nTo follow my lead, all you need is an Azure Subscription and an account set up to gain access to Azure OpenAI Studio.\n \nStep 1: Create the Azure SQL Server on Linux based VM:\nLet\u2019s start by setting up a Linux-based VM on Azure. For this demonstration, I\u2019ll be configuring an Ubuntu 22.04 VM. Below is the script to first create a resource group, followed by the creation of a VM named SQLLinux22 running Ubuntu 22.04. \n \n \n# let's create the resource group using the command:\naz group create --name myrgdemo --location centralindia\n\n#lets create VM using Ubuntu image, I am using this image: 0001-com-ubuntu-minimal-jammy\n\naz vm create --resource-group myrgdemo --name sqllinux22 --size \"Standard_B4ms\" --location \"central india\" --image \"Canonical:0001-com-ubuntu-minimal-jammy:minimal-22_04-lts:22.04.202405131\" --admin-username \"amvin\" --admin-password \"MY$trongPass123*#\" --authentication-type all --generate-ssh-keys\n\n \n \nOnce the VM is set up, proceed to install SQL Server by following the guidelines provided in the official Microsoft documentation.\nStep 2: Enable TLS 1.2 Encryption on SQL Server on Linux, to secure SQL Server connections:\nFollowing the installation of SQL Server, it\u2019s time to move on to step 2: enabling TLS 1.2 encryption to secure connections to SQL Server. But first, you need to set up a DNS name for the VM you\u2019ve created, as it\u2019s necessary for generating the certificate. You can configure the DNS name via the Azure portal. Once it\u2019s set up, it will appear as shown. Remember to also enable port 80 in the VM\u2019s Network Settings, which is required by Certbot for certificate creation.\n\n\n \nWith that completed, it\u2019s now time to install Certbot and generate the necessary certificate. Log into the VM using your preferred SSH client and execute the following commands. These will install Certbot and then create the certificate using the DNS name you have set up.\n \n \namvin@sqllinux22:~$ sudo snap install --classic certbot\n2024-05-16T21:11:23Z INFO Waiting for automatic snapd restart...\ncertbot 2.10.0 from Certbot Project (certbot-eff\u2713) installed\n\n## After the installation go ahead and create the certificate and private key file.\n\namvin@sqllinux22:~$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone --key-type rsa --preferred-challenges http -d sqllinux22.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com\nSaving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log\nEnter email address (used for urgent renewal and security notices)\n (Enter 'c' to cancel): xxxxxxxxxxx\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nPlease read the Terms of Service at\nhttps://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.4-April-3-2024.pdf.

I connected to the SQL Server Azure VM using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) on my Windows machine and downloaded the dataset locally.\n\u00a0\nNext, I utilized the SSMS import flat file wizard to transfer the data from the file to SQL Server on the Azure VM. Once the dataset is loaded into the table, the data is displayed as follows.\n\n\u00a0\nStep 4: Create the Azure AI search service, Index and import data from SQL Server:\nWith data loaded, let's log in to the Azure Portal, search for AI search -> click on create and create the search service as shown below:\n\n\u00a0\nonce, the search service is created, we need to link it to the Azure SQL Server VM to import the data into the search. During the import process, it\u2019s crucial to ensure that you map the correct data type. In this instance, I chose the string data type for all columns during the import.

So on one hand, this isn\u2019t new news, as the initial infection happened back in 2011, and was reported then. On the other hand, according to the new Eset report, four kernel.org servers were infected, with two of them possibly compromised for as long as two years. That compromise apparently included credential stealing or password cracking.\nThe Ebury attackers seem to gain initial access through credential stuffing \u2014 a huge list of previously captured credentials are tried one at a time. However, once the malware has a foothold in the network, a combination of automated and manual steps are taken to move laterally. The most obvious is to grab any private SSH keys from that system, and try using them to access other machines on the local network. Ebury also replaces a system library that gets called as a part of sshd\n, libkeyutils.so\n. This puts it in a position to quietly capture credentials.\nFor a targeted attack against a more important target, the people behind Ebury seem to go hands-on-keyboard, using techniques like Man-in-the-Middle attacks against SSH logins on the local network using ARP spoofing. In this case, someone was doing something nasty.\nAnd that doesn\u2019t even start to cover the actual payload. That\u2019s nasty too, hooking into Apache to sniff for usernames and passwords in HTTP/S traffic, redirecting links to malicious sites, and more. And of course, the boring things you might expect, like sending spam, mining for Bitcoin, etc. Ebury isn\u2019t exactly easy to notice, either, since it includes a rootkit module that hooks into system functions to hide itself. Thankfully there are a couple of ways to get a clean shell to look for the malware, like using systemd-run\nor launching a local shell on the system console.\nAnd the multi-million dollar question: Who was behind this? Sadly we don\u2019t know. A single arrest was made in 2014, and recovered files implicated another Russian citizen, but the latest work indicates this was yet another stolen identity. The rest of the actors behind Ebury have gone to great lengths to remain behind the curtain.\nThe Great 12 Second Ethereum Heist\nEthereum moved from a proof-of-work to proof-of-stake model back in 2022. That had some interesting ramifications, like making the previously random block times a predictable 12 second cadence. With a change that big, there were bound to be some bugs around the edges. In this case, the edge is the MEV-Boost algorithm, which a pair of brothers managed to manipulate into giving them $25 million worth of Ethereum. The DOJ went after the two for wire fraud, and made a point that the hack happened in just 12 seconds.\nThat seems to be the point. The trick here is was to make a bunch of worthless transactions look really appealing to the MEV-Boost algorithm, while also running the validator that actually processed the block. Being in this privileged position on both sides of the block creation allowed for tampering with the transaction. It\u2019s definitely not what the Ethereum network needed. And pro tip: If you\u2019re going to commit wire fraud, try not to leave a search engine history detailing your money laundering and extradition avoidance plans.\nWiFi and SSID Confusion\nThere\u2019s a new WiFi issue, that seems to be an actual vulnerability in the 802.11 spec itself. The key is a man-in-the-middle attack on the raw wireless traffic, which is fairly easy. Some of the negotiation process happens in the clear, so the attacker can manipulate that data, to rewrite the SSID in the initial connection attempt. This results in the legitimate access point sending back a message suggesting that the victim connect to a different AP. There is one important point to make here: The \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d network can use different security types, but do need to use the same password. So this is of limited use, though there are certainly cases where it could be misused.\n16 Year Long Tale\nTurn back your clocks to 2008, and remember CVE-2008-0166, a vulnerability in the Debian OpenSSL packages. That was a Debian patch to fix a usage of uninitialized memory in the OpenSSL random number generator. Yes it was accessing uninitialized memory \u2014 to use it as seed for the random number generator. The result is that on Debian systems from 2006 to 2008 could only generate a few thousand discrete keys. What [Hanno B\u00f6ck] realized was that the DKIM email specification was released in 2007. How many DKIM certificates still around today were generated on Debian before the bug was fixed? At least 855, or about a quarter of a percent of the domains checked. Oops. That\u2019s a very long tail indeed.\nBits and Bytes\nCare to shut down a website? If that site is protected by a vulnerable Web Application Firewall, it\u2019s fairly easy to include a comment that looks suspicious enough to trick the WAF into blocking its own site. The rule that\u2019s triggered is actually intended to keep internal error messages from spilling out into the open web. It\u2019s a bit tamer version of the database deletion trick we covered a few weeks ago.\nSprocket Security did the hard work for us, patch diffing the fix for CVE-2024-3400 in Palo Alto GlobalProtect. This write-up is more about the actual approach to getting a vulnerable copy of the software to make the comparison against. And if you wondered, it\u2019s command injection, due to shell=True\nwhere it shouldn\u2019t be.\nAnd finally, there was a VirtualBox vulnerability used in the latest Pwn2Own competition, and the details are available. A bit clearing routine for the virtual VGA device has a memory handling error in it, allowing manipulation of memory outside the intended bounds. In the competition, it was used for privilege escalation inside the VM, but it has potential for full VM escape in some cases.\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

The wheel file (.whl) will be stored in a newly created dist/ directory under custom_operators folder.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 3: Building Airflow DAG\u00a0Now that we have build our custom operators and created the wheel package, now we need to create a dag that will trigger these operators.for that i created 2 tasks, fetch_github_data and count_languages.\u00a0each will call the operators above\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nfrom airflow import DAG\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nfrom custom_operators.github_operators import GitHubAPIReaderOperator,CountLanguagesOperator\ndefault_args = {\n    'owner': 'airflow',\n    'start_date': datetime(2023, 1, 1),\n    'depends_on_past': False,\n    'email_on_failure': False,\n    'email_on_retry': False,\n    'retries': 1,\n    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),\n}\n\ndag = DAG(\n    'github_language_analysis',\n    default_args=default_args,\n    description='Analyze GitHub repos for language usage',\n    schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),\n)\n\nfetch_github_data = GitHubAPIReaderOperator(\n    task_id='fetch_github_data',\n    api_url='https://api.github.com/repositories',\n    max_pages=10,  \n    token='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',  # Replace with your actual token\n    dag=dag\n)\n\ncount_languages = CountLanguagesOperator(\n    task_id='count_languages',\n    api_url='https://api.github.com',\n\ttoken='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',  # Replace with your actual token\n    dag=dag\n)\n\nfetch_github_data >> count_languages\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 4: Run DAG in ADF Data orchestration manager\u00a0\nNow, we built our DAG and our custom package. in order to run it in ADF. \n1. Create managed Airflow instance in ADF following MS docs. \n2. in ADLS workspace, create the folder hierarchy as the following:\n\nIn the requirements file, include the path to the custom package stored in your ADLS storage account as follows:\n/opt/airflow/dags/custom_operators-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl\n3.\u00a0In the ADF workspace, click on \"Import files.\" Navigate to your ADLS storage account, locate the \"Airflow\" folder, and check the \"Import requirements\" checkbox.\n\u00a0\n\nit will take a few minutes till ADF orchestration manager will update the code and the custom package.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStep 5: Logs and Monitoring\u00a0\nAfter importing the files, click on the \"Monitor\" button in the Data Orchestration Manager to view task execution and export Airflow logs. This will open the Airflow UI.\n\u00a0\nDAG:\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nLogs in count_languages task :\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nP.S: For more dynamic work, you can save\u00a0the languages count as a JSON file and store it in your storage account.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLinks:\nInstall a Private package - Azure Data Factory | Microsoft LearnHow does Workflow Orchestration Manager work? - Azure Data Factory | Microsoft Learn\nairflow.operators.python \u2014 Airflow Documentation (apache.org)\u00a0airflow.providers.microsoft.azure \u2014 apache-airflow-providers-microsoft-azure Documentation\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCall to Action:- Make sure to establish all connections before starting to work on managed airflow.- check MS documentation on Workflow Orchestration Manager.-\u00a0Please help us improve by sharing your valuable Workflow Orchestration Manager Preview feedback by emailing us at ManagedAirflow@microsoft.com- Follow me on LinkedIn:\u00a0Sally Dabbah | LinkedIn\n\u00a0\n\n", "hash": "5b69587236427b62c9a8f3956c63ba6c2f568661d529aba94904b84ed39c76eb", "id": "d19d97dc-7aaf-4da7-9bd4-69eb3e560a3c", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/fasttrack-for-azure/step-by-step-guide-building-and-integrating-custom-package-in/ba-p/4131566", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-17T13:56:35", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "253cad5b-dd6a-4146-9d93-37f39416a161", "title": "Step-by-Step Guide: Building and Integrating Custom Package in ADF Workflow Orchestration Manager"}], "tags": {"ADF": {"name": "ADF", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Airflow": {"name": "Airflow", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Airflow UI": {"name": "Airflow UI", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Step-by-Step Guide: Building and Integrating Custom Package in ADF Workflow Orchestration Manager"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T17:17:28.843732", "id": "94928617-0222-4ae1-b7af-ad3da866be78", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-17T13:54:17", "id": "4b68283f-c52b-4bc5-87ca-fc44c8685fcf", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Der Europarat hat eine Konvention zum Schutz der Menschenrechte beim Umgang mit K\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz (KI) angenommen. \"Mit diesem neuen Vertrag wollen wir einen verantwortungsvollen Einsatz von KI sicherstellen, der die Menschenrechte, die Rechtsstaatlichkeit und die Demokratie respektiert\", sagte die Generalsekret\u00e4rin des Europarats, Marija Pej\u010dinovi\u0107 Buri\u0107, am Freitag in Stra\u00dfburg.\nK\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz\nEuroparat nimmt KI-Konvention an\nDamit sollen Menschenrechte beim Umgang mit K\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz besser gew\u00e4hrleistet werden", "hash": "7f541155a723f37f08038058637a88700424cf16f6bcca73c6caf591f6d6007b", "id": "87d24701-efaf-408e-9983-186e4cb34bb3", "link": "https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000220640/europarat-nimmt-ki-konvention-an?ref=rss", "osint_source_id": "42533a73-8f0b-43a1-9185-6c37f7fa9a5f", "published": "2024-05-17T13:54:17", "source": "https://www.derstandard.at/rss/web", "story_id": "4b68283f-c52b-4bc5-87ca-fc44c8685fcf", "title": "Europarat nimmt KI-Konvention an"}], "tags": {"Stra\u00dfburg": {"name": "Stra\u00dfburg", "tag_type": "LOC"}}, "title": "Europarat nimmt KI-Konvention an"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T17:14:35.874205", "id": "410a092f-8be2-44e1-a788-598595790e83", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-17T13:48:08", "id": "8e7dfa2c-3e22-446d-b369-ba34f2c27a55", "news_items": [{"author": "Amy Blais", "content": "Mattermost security update Desktop App v5.8.0 released\nWe\u2019re informing you about a Mattermost security update, which addresses low- to medium-level severity vulnerabilities.

It allows the generation of natural language responses that are relevant, coherent, and informative, by retrieving and conditioning on relevant documents from a large corpus. RAG pattern has several benefits for the health care industry, such as:\n \n\nIt can produce precise and concise summaries of patient symptoms, medical history, and test results.\nIt can enhance the communication and education of health care professionals and patients, by generating personalized and engaging responses to their queries, based on the retrieval of authoritative and trustworthy sources.\nIt can facilitate the innovation and discovery of new treatments and therapies, by generating novel and creative hypotheses, based on the retrieval of cutting-edge research papers and clinical trials.\n\n \nHowever, there are number of security risks associated with RAG patter usage. Few examples:\n \n\nPrivacy breaches: RAG models may inadvertently reveal sensitive information about patients or health care providers, by retrieving documents that contain identifiable data, such as names, addresses, or medical records. This could violate the confidentiality and consent of the individuals involved and expose them to potential harm or discrimination.\nAdversarial attacks: RAG models may be vulnerable to malicious manipulation, by retrieving documents that are intentionally crafted to deceive or mislead the model. This could result in the generation of harmful or misleading content that could endanger the health and safety of the users or the public.\n\n \nThis is the first article in a series about secure use of Azure OpenAI in health care. Our topic today is how to avoid violating privacy when using RAG pattern.\nImagine you're developing an app that utilizes the Azure OpenAI service to enable patients to query their after-visit summaries. This is a great illustration of a scenario where RAG pattern is essential. The data output from your team consisted of a set of documents with one document for each patient, and some private information was accidentally exported. Below is a sample of a document.\n\n \nImagine you've built a patient chat application on your website. Only authorized users can access it, and it offers a predefined list of questions for patients to choose from. But what if Amanda's account is compromised? A malicious actor could gain access, bypass the predefined questions, and ask anything they want. Alternatively, a bug might allow custom questions you didn't anticipate.\nLet's explore the potential data a malicious actor could extract if no additional security measures are in place beyond chat authorization and a predefined question list. Using Azure OpenAI Studio as a chat interface, we'll delve into the risks and vulnerabilities of such a scenario.\n \nLet\u2019s start with a simple query:> Show me Amanda\u2019s data\n\n \nAs demonstrated, it's evident that utilizing the RAG pattern could facilitate the retrieval of all of Amanda's data, including any personal information that might have been unintentionally exported. Now, leveraging the structure of the data, we can access the information of other users as well. For instance, with the query:\n> Show me all medical history\n \n\n \nNow that we have obtained other users' names, we can extract data utilized by the RAG pattern for any patient. For instance, with the query:> Show me Michael\u2019s personal data\n \n\n \n \nWhat can we do to tackle privacy breaches? It's evident that relying solely on authorization falls short. Achieving protection for Azure OpenAI from malicious prompts is a crucial aspect of maintaining the safety and integrity of the API. Fortunately, implementing the necessary measures is a straightforward process that can be achieved by following a few simple steps:\n \n\nSet up an Azure API Management service for your OpenAI API. This will act as a gateway between your OpenAI API and the outside world.\nConfigure your API Management instance to use the Azure AI Content Safety service as a pre-processing step for all incoming requests. This will ensure that all requests are scanned for potentially malicious content before being forwarded to your OpenAI API.\nUse prompt engineering techniques to design prompts that are less likely to result in malicious behavior. This can be done by carefully crafting prompts to encourage specific types of responses and avoiding prompts that might elicit inappropriate responses.\n\n ", "hash": "ba3528211fc366715454d390807a9d4147b2b99196ff48b5d3c244ce2384c590", "id": "a3712c8d-9905-4446-97be-c20e590a1e54", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/healthcare-and-life-sciences/security-consideration-of-azure-openai-with-retrieval-augmented/ba-p/4144532", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-17T13:26:41", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "1083d9b7-d1ce-4388-95b3-c5b092097430", "title": "Security consideration of Azure OpenAI with Retrieval Augmented Generative pattern (part 1 of 3)"}], "tags": {"API": {"name": "API", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Amanda": {"name": "Amanda", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Michael": {"name": "Michael", "tag_type": "PER"}, "RAG": {"name": "RAG", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Security consideration of Azure OpenAI with Retrieval Augmented Generative pattern (part 1 of 3)"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T17:13:14.544188", "id": "2e2bf5a7-e47b-47b7-a123-823edafe5598", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "5"}, {"created": "2024-05-17T17:15:54.786153", "id": "7d85070c-354a-4c0a-b2ff-ae71ce3e2941", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "9"}], "created": "2024-05-17T13:04:18", "id": "30e55b0a-39fa-4388-96a3-813c7ca6ed71", "news_items": [{"author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "content": "On May 5th, 2024, the City of Wichita, Kansas, was the victim of a ransomware attack and shut down its network to contain the threat.

Although we tend not to realize about their cloud dependency until such services stop functioning or involve in an \u201cunfortunate\u201d event where a cybersecurity breach result in data leak.\nI said \u201cunfortunate\u201d as one of the first misconception is any services deployed on Cloud should have been already \u201csecured\u201d, when it is a continuous education that Cloud Security is a Shared Responsibility between cloud customer and cloud service provider. Another challenge is an organization may have to let Cloud Security takes a back seat while prioritizing to migrate/deployment of service to cloud.\nFire Fighting\nHaving a comprehensive monitoring, detection & response no doubt is an important part of overall Cloud Security. Although solely focus on security alerts may mislead to react to whatever cause the latest security incident and less on what is a suitable strategic approach. Let\u2019s say a high-profile vulnerability in the news may trigger an organization to urgently scan all cloud assets for the related Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE). Then if a security incident result in a sensitive data leak occurs, the focus likely shifts to do data classification and encryption at rest.\nCloud and Security together leave a vast knowledge gap\nIt is rare to have every team member with a similar expertise in both cybersecurity and cloud, let alone knowledge in multiple cloud service providers. This leaves room of interpretation of each security personal what to response first: a vulnerability scan alert, a cloud security posture finding, a sensitive data found in storage expose to public internet? What if they are all critical level severity and come in a same time?\n\u201cI\u2019d rather NOT KNOW, what I DON\u2019T WANT TO KNOW.\u201d\nDespite 76% of organizations are extremely or very concern about Cloud Security according to 2023 Cloud Security report, do not be surprised a push back for taking on Cloud Security responsibility. First scenario is either security and/or cloud operation teams are in an alert fatigue from their existing security monitoring. Another push back could cause by endless fixing because of security auditing cycle occupying team\u2019s personal and priority.\nConnect the Security Dots by Effective Risk\nInstead of driven by number of alerts from multiple sources, consider a risk base approach (likelihood x impact = risk). This connects the \u201csecurity dots\u201d into a holistic easy-to-understand indicator regardless of individual\u2019s level of cloud knowledge.\nLeverage your team familiarity of each cloud\nA team member with extensive experience would know which of sometimes hundreds of cloud accounts and/or subscriptions are crucial, which specific names of virtual machine, storage or database fleets are super important and impactful to business operation, or any workload with sandbox tagged can tolerate certain security settings for experimental. However, such insightfulness is not necessarily common in your team especially among newly joined individuals. Why not embed these non-technical indicators directly into the risk calculation by defining business priority rules, then the effective risk score would adjust accordingly.\nConclusion\nWith CloudGuard Effective Risk Management, the security risk score is automatically calculated for individual cloud asset as well as for each cloud account/subscription. A further optimization to make it even more relevant to your organization is simple.\nStructure your cloud accounts and subscriptions into organizational units within CloudGuard portal. This could base on the business unit, production and non-production, or any other combination meaningful to your cloud estate.\n-\nLabel a business priority for each cloud account/subscription or OU defined in CloudGuard in the earlier step. The priority label is based on its relevant to business, service, revenue or others non-technical significant.\n-\nAdd more fine grain business priority rules based on cloud asset name, or key/value tag where needed.\n-\nSimple as that! Start a regular review of CloudGuard ERM Dashboard, where you will find a list of cloud assets with the highest security risk score. Then structurally prepare an action plan to focus on addressing each security findings of these high-risk assets.\nCloudGuard Effective Risk Management is available on CloudGuard CNAPP.", "hash": "ac0662ae04bed851a34d8d879937995b504b43b981b45700547d5331f8a53c50", "id": "2bd2a88b-7a96-443f-a30c-816d5c582c75", "link": "https://blog.checkpoint.com/securing-the-cloud/connect-the-security-dots-by-cloudguard-effective-risk-management/", "osint_source_id": "5af32728-cd06-4304-b20a-485ddcde89a2", "published": "2024-05-17T13:00:17", "source": "https://blog.checkpoint.com/feed/", "story_id": "af659531-f4ad-4e57-82b4-4af4ed19ba66", "title": "Connect the Security Dots by CloudGuard Effective Risk Management"}], "tags": {"CloudGuard CNAPP": {"name": "CloudGuard CNAPP", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Connect the Security Dots by CloudGuard Effective Risk Management"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T17:14:59.674950", "id": "73ea1e9a-390c-4364-8d73-5bfeef481c68", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "5"}, {"created": "2024-05-17T17:24:18.659841", "id": "dca2c440-ed8e-4015-a016-6c808725db5b", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "26"}], "created": "2024-05-17T13:00:00", "id": "7477e1ed-d4a2-4893-ad0d-66ed6143c429", "news_items": [{"author": "BeauHD", "content": "Arizona Woman Accused of Helping North Koreans Get Remote IT Jobs At 300 Companies (arstechnica.com) 30\nAn anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: An Arizona woman has been accused of helping generate millions of dollars for North Korea's ballistic missile program by helping citizens of that country land IT jobs at US-based Fortune 500 companies. Christina Marie Chapman, 49, of Litchfield Park, Arizona, raised $6.8 million in the scheme, federal prosecutors said in an indictment unsealed Thursday. Chapman allegedly funneled the money to North Korea's Munitions Industry Department, which is involved in key aspects of North Korea's weapons program, including its development of ballistic missiles. Part of the alleged scheme involved Chapman and co-conspirators compromising the identities of more than 60 people living in the US and using their personal information to get North Koreans IT jobs across more than 300 US companies.\nAs another part of the alleged conspiracy, Chapman operated a \"laptop farm\" at one of her residences to give the employers the impression the North Korean IT staffers were working from within the US; the laptops were issued by the employers. By using proxies and VPNs, the overseas workers appeared to be connecting from US-based IP addresses. Chapman also received employees' paychecks at her home, prosecutors said. Federal prosecutors said that Chapman and three North Korean IT workers -- using the aliases of Jiho Han, Chunji Jin, Haoran Xu, and others -- had been working since at least 2020 to plan a remote-work scheme. In March of that year, prosecutors said, an individual messaged Chapman on LinkedIn and invited her to \"be the US face\" of their company. From August to November of 2022, the North Korean IT workers allegedly amassed guides and other information online designed to coach North Koreans on how to write effective cover letters and resumes and falsify US Permanent Resident Cards.\nUnder the alleged scheme, the foreign workers developed \"fictitious personas and online profiles to match the job requirements\" and submitted fake documents to the Homeland Security Department as part of an employment eligibility check. Chapman also allegedly discussed with co-conspirators about transferring the money earned from their work. Chapman was arrested Wednesday. It wasn't immediately known when she or Didenko were scheduled to make their first appearance in court. If convicted, Chapman faces 97.5 years in prison, and Didenko faces up to 67.5 years.\nAs another part of the alleged conspiracy, Chapman operated a \"laptop farm\" at one of her residences to give the employers the impression the North Korean IT staffers were working from within the US; the laptops were issued by the employers.

Bx F/W: 2.16WW and below routers, allowing attackers to make configuration changes to vulnerable devices.\nAccording to a NIST advisory, the CSRF flaws can be exploited remotely to \u201chijack the authentication of administrators for requests that create an administrator account or enable remote management via a crafted configuration module to hedwig.cgi, activate new configuration settings via a SETCFG,SAVE,ACTIVATE action to pigwidgeon.cgi, or send a ping via a ping action to diagnostic.php.\u201d\nDetails on these issues were initially published by Infosec Institute\u2019s Dawid Czagan in January 2014, but no exploitation reports have been published prior to CISA\u2019s warning.

These rules include developing and implementing data protection policies, confidentiality and security assurances, and protecting against anticipated threats.\nThe new amendments adopted earlier this week impact financial firms, such as broker-dealers (funding portals included), investment firms, registered investment advisers, and transfer agents.\nThe modifications were initially proposed in March of last year to modernize and improve the protection of individual financial information from data breaches and exposure to non-affiliated parties.\nBelow is a summary of the introduced changes:\nNotify affected individuals within 30 days if their sensitive information is, or is likely to be, accessed or used without authorization, detailing the incident, breached data, and protective measures taken. Exemption applies if the information isn't expected to cause substantial harm or inconvenience to the exposed individuals.\n-\nDevelop, implement, and maintain written policies and procedures for an incident response program to detect, respond to, and recover from unauthorized access or use of customer information. This should include procedures to assess and contain security incidents, enforce policies, and oversee service providers.\n-\nExpand safeguards and disposal rules to cover all nonpublic personal information, including that received from other financial institutions.\n-\nRequire documentation of compliance with safeguards and disposal rules, excluding funding portals.\n-\nAlign annual privacy notice delivery with the FAST Act, exempting certain conditions.\n-\nExtend safeguards and disposal rules to transfer agents registered with the SEC or other regulatory agencies.\n-\nThe modifications represent an important update to a rule initially adopted in 2000 that could no longer adequately protect customers' financial data privacy in today's cybersecurity landscape.\n\"Over the last 24 years, the nature, scale, and impact of data breaches has transformed substantially,\" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\n\"These amendments to Regulation S-P will make critical updates to a rule first adopted in 2000 and help protect the privacy of customers' financial data.\"\n\"The basic idea for covered firms is if you've got a breach, then you've got to notify. That's good for investors.\"\nThe amendments take effect 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, the official journal of the U.S. federal government, including agency rules, proposed rules, and public notices.\nLarger organizations have a compliance date of 18 months after the modifications are published in the Federal Register. For smaller entities, the period extends to two years.\nIn December, the SEC also introduced new rules requiring all public companies to disclose that they suffered a breach if it materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

Also patched by Ivanti are two other SQL injection flaws (CVE-2023-46806 and CVE-2023-46807, CVSS scores: 6.7) that could allow an authenticated user with appropriate privilege to access or modify data in the underlying database.\nWhile there is no evidence that these flaws have been exploited, users are advised to update to the latest version to mitigate potential threats.", "hash": "99a6a286568bc7105ac34b3a82b0c991290b00bba43771d546b5decc5f2f6042", "id": "d9783456-93eb-4df9-830e-5747c3fd96fb", "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2024/05/cisa-warns-of-actively-exploited-d-link.html", "osint_source_id": "ef5f3f17-365f-4dfb-889d-5a3ef3bdfff0", "published": "2024-05-17T12:13:00", "source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheHackersNews", "story_id": "cdaa8658-1637-411d-bb36-ff5c2d5d5f52", "title": "CISA Warns of Actively Exploited D-Link Router Vulnerabilities - Patch Now"}], "tags": {"Bryan Smith": {"name": "Bryan Smith", "tag_type": "PER"}, "CISA": {"name": "CISA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CVE-2014-100005": {"name": "CVE-2014-100005", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2021-40655": {"name": "CVE-2021-40655", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2023-46806": {"name": "CVE-2023-46806", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2023-46807": {"name": "CVE-2023-46807", "tag_type": "cves"}, "CVE-2024-22026": {"name": "CVE-2024-22026", "tag_type": "cves"}, "D-Link": {"name": "D-Link", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "DIR-X4860": {"name": "DIR-X4860", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "EOL": {"name": "EOL", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "EPMM": {"name": "EPMM", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Endpoint Manager Mobile": {"name": "Endpoint Manager Mobile", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Ivanti": {"name": "Ivanti", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Ivanti Patches Multiple Flaws": {"name": "Ivanti Patches Multiple Flaws", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "KEV": {"name": "KEV", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "LAN-side": {"name": "LAN-side", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "PoC": {"name": "PoC", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "SQL Injection": {"name": "SQL Injection", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency": {"name": "U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "CISA Warns of Actively Exploited D-Link Router Vulnerabilities - Patch Now"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T17:13:20.493670", "id": "9a525ea6-4299-43e2-9847-a8f3c72794f6", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "9"}], "created": "2024-05-17T12:06:43", "id": "40bcd9c4-70b4-4f02-bca0-48e4d3bea695", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Das war die erste Suchmaschine des Internets\nIn den 1980er-Jahren hatte das Internet nur einen winzigen Bruchteil der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, die es heute hat.

Instead of investing the victims' funds as initially promised, the fraudsters siphon all their cryptocurrency to accounts and crypto wallets under their control.\nChinese nations Daren Li and Yicheng Zhang were arrested on April 12 at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and yesterday in Los Angeles.\nCourt documents reveal that the defendants and their accomplice moved millions transferred by pig butchering victims to U.S. bank accounts linked to dozens of shell companies to various domestic and international bank accounts and cryptocurrency platforms to hide their source and ownership.\nLi and Zhang reportedly directed associates to open these bank accounts, and they also monitored the transfer of more than $73 million to Deltec Bank in The Bahamas, where the money was converted into cryptocurrency, including USDT (Tether).\nWhile investigating the scheme, law enforcement agents discovered over $341 million in cryptocurrency in one of the crypto wallets used for money laundering. Communications between the suspects and their accomplices also revealed details regarding commissions, information on the shell companies they used throughout the laundering process, victim details, and interactions with U.S. financial institutions.\n\"Complex financial fraud schemes such as pig butchering present a clear and present threat to the financial infrastructure of the United States as countless numbers of Americans continue to be victimized by this predatory activity,\" said Brian Lambert, Assistant Director of Investigations of the U.S. Secret Service.\n\"In 2023, the Secret Service with our partners recovered more than $1.1 billion in financial fraud and we are on pace to exceed that number this year.\"\nLi and Zhang are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and six counts of international money laundering. They face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count if convicted.\nIn December, the U.S. Department of Justice charged four other suspects\u2014Lu Zhang, Justin Walker, Joseph Wong, and Hailong Zhu\u2014for their alleged involvement in a massive pig butchering scheme that led to over $80 million in victim losses.\nThe FBI's 2023 Internet Crime Report warned [PDF] that investment fraud investment scams saw a 38% increase from $3.31 billion in 2022 to $4.57 billion in 2023.\n\"In 2023, the losses reported due to Investment scams became the most of any crime type tracked by the IC3,\" the FBI said. \"Within these numbers, investment fraud with a reference to cryptocurrency rose from $2.57 billion in 2022 to $3.96 billion in 2023, an increase of 53%.\"\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

We appreciate your patience and understanding during this time,\u201d the website stated.\nThe incident recalls an October 2022 ransomware attack on Medibank, one of the country\u2019s largest health insurance providers, that led to the scandalous publication of sensitive healthcare data.\nAs part of the Medibank criminals\u2019 extortion attempt, sensitive healthcare claims data for around 480,000 individuals \u2014 including information about drug addiction treatments and abortions \u2014 was published on the dark web.\nThe move, alongside several other high-profile breaches, set off a range of cybersecurity reforms in Australia. These included an updated national cybersecurity strategy that ultimately fell short of the government\u2019s initial intentions to ban ransomware payments in their entirety.\nFollowing the Medibank incident, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States imposed sanctions and travel bans on a Russian hacker, Aleksandr Ermakov, whom they accused of being involved in the extortion attempt.\nAustralia\u2019s national cybersecurity coordinator \u2014 an office established in the wake of the Medibank incident \u2014 said the government was aware of the MediSecure incident, and that the Australian federal police were investigating it.\n\u201cWe are in the very preliminary stages of our response and there is limited detail to share at this stage, but I will continue to provide updates as we progress while working closely with the affected commercial organisation to address the impacts caused by the incident,\u201d wrote the coordinator, Michelle McGuinness, on social media.\nClare O\u2019Neil, Australia\u2019s minister for cybersecurity, said she had been briefed on the incident. \u201cUpdates will be provided in due course,\u201d she wrote on social media. \u201cSpeculation at this stage risks undermining significant work underway to support the company\u2019s response.\u201d\nAlexander Martin\nis the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

Whereas a couple years ago, they'd be pretty happy if they put a banner up on a website, that website went down for a little bit, and they'd call that a victory.\"\nStill, it's the second time in a year that cops have reportedly seized control of the criminal souk. A prior version of BreachForums was shut down in June 2023 after a similar law enforcement effort.\nAnd it's worth noting that BreachForums took over from the previously taken down RaidForums, which shuttered in 2022 following another joint police raid.\nIt's really difficult to dismantle an organization fully. If you can't identify the person at the keyboard and then take them offline, you just can't do it.\nPlus, while law enforcement has named and shamed the suspect they believe is LockBitSupp \u2013 Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev \u2013 he's not going to get cuffed anytime soon unless he's dumb enough to leave Russia. So it's plausible that if he is who they say he is, he'll spin up another ransomware-as-a-service operation soon enough.\nDespite the seeming whac-a-mole nature of these takedowns, they \"absolutely work,\" McPherson says.\nMcPherson was the agent in charge of the FBI Tampa field office when it became the first to come across the Hive ransomware variant \u2013 and eventually led the seizure of the criminal crew's network.\nThat operation \u2013 which shuttered the crew's websites and took control of its servers \u2013 was the culmination of a seven-month covert operation during which the FBI hacked Hive's network and used that access to provide decryption keys to more than 300 victims.\nWhen it comes to police takedowns of these criminal networks, \"the level of effectiveness varies,\" McPherson concedes.\n\"It didn't take long for BreachForums last time to get back up after the last arrest,\" he adds \u2013 referring to the site's former admin Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, aka \"Pompourin,\" who was sentenced to 20 years of supervised release in January after his arrest earlier that month. BreachForums resurfaced shortly after.\n\"It's still a disruptive event,\" McPherson says. \"There's always a difference between a disruption and a dismantlement.\"\nDisruption vs dismantlement\n\"Disruption is a temporary state: you're going to cause confusion, you're going to sow distrust, you're going to slow an organization down, you're going to cost them more money, you're going to put pain on the adversary,\" he says.\nMeanwhile, dismantlement involves arrests and confiscating infrastructure.\n\"Any time you're going after an organization \u2013 whether you're talking about organized crime, terrorism, cyber crime nation-states \u2014 dismantlements are very hard, and they usually come at the end of multiple, multiple disruptions, a sustained effort of disruptions over time,\" McPherson explains. \"It's a sustained pressure campaign.\"\nAustin Berglas, also a former FBI agent who now works as global head of professional services at BlueVoyant, puts the BreachForum operation more in the potential dismantlement category.\n\"It remains to be seen, but it sounds like a dismantlement because it sounds like they've arrested the administrators,\" he tells The Register.\nBerglas cites the website's seizure banner showing the admins locked up along with Telegram chatter. \"If that's the case, it's closer to a dismantlement,\" Berglas observes. \"It sounds like they're deep in, they have full access to the back end. And when you've got that administrator access on the back end, then you start getting into some of the non-anonymized communications \u2013 the personal private communications that administrators and site owners are sending to each other. That's really where the meat and potatoes are.\"\nFBI takes down BreachForums ransomware website and Telegram channel\n-\nCops finally unmask 'LockBit kingpin' after two-month tease\n-\nA tale of 2 casino ransomware attacks: One paid out, one did not\n-\nRSA Conference 2024: The good, the bad, and the downright worrying\n-\nPart of the reason why dismantlement is so hard has to do with Russia and other countries providing safe harbor for cyber criminals \u2013 essentially making it impossible to arrest them, Berglas adds.\n\"That's the key: the more pressure, sanctions, government political pressure that you can put on these nations to stop being safe harbors and start giving people up \u2013 that's what it's going to take,\" he says.\nAnd he admits this is probably unrealistic.\n\"I'm not a politician. All I know is the difficulty from experiencing it firsthand,\" Berglas explains. \"It's really difficult to dismantle an organization fully. If you can't get the individuals, can't identify the person at the keyboard and then take them offline, you just can't do it.\"\nFrom LulzSec to Silk Road\nBerglas is a former assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's New York Office Cyber Branch \u2013 a post he held for more than a decade. During that time, \"we did numerous disruptions, and a few dismantlements,\" he recalls.\nOne of these dismantlements was LulzSec \u2013 the group linked to Anonymous, and its leader Sabu, who was arrested in June 2011.\n\"We turned [Sabu]. He became an informant, we put him back online and we were able to arrest the rest of that crew,\" Berglas says. Sabu was also important in the government's case against Julian Assange.\nSilk Road, the notorious online drug market shut down by the FBI in 2013, is another one Berglas was involved with during his time at the bureau.\n\"That was a full dismantlement. We took that site down and arrested the site's administrator and owner and creator,\" he recalls. \"Disruptions are more common because they're easier. And I'm doing air quotes around 'easier,' because it's not easy to identify the infrastructure, get access to that infrastructure, be able to take it down, and make everybody who's on that site scamper like mice to another site.\"\nIs Scattered Spider next?\nAfter LockBit, and the earlier ALPHV disruption in December 2023 \u2013 before an affiliate from that crew came back to extort Change Healthcare for $22 million \u2013 the big target remains on Scattered Spider. That's the crew that famously broke into two Las Vegas casinos' networks over the summer and remains at large \u2013 except for one arrest, a 19-year-old suspect from Florida.\nPrivate security researchers have tracked this crew of teens and 20-somethings, believed to be in the US and the UK, since at least 2022 \u2013 but so far they have mostly managed to evade the cops.\n\"These investigations can be years in the making, unfortunately,\" Jon Clay, Trend Micro's VP of threat intel, tells The Register. \"It's not like you do it in a week.\"\nHowever, there are indications that the FBI is getting closer to nabbing key members of this group \u2013 including comments made by Brett Leatherman, the FBI's cyber deputy assistant director, to reporters during last week's RSA Conference.\n\"Brett Leatherman is out there talking publicly about [how] we're going to do something \u2013 the FBI never talks like that,\" McPherson observes, adding that he has no insider knowledge of plans regarding Scattered Spider.\n\"But they're under tremendous pressure to do something,\" he says. \"I think that was a signal to say, 'we got it, just give us a little bit of time.' Or sometimes it's because they're doing something else. Maybe they penetrated the group, maybe they're talking to people, maybe they found people already.\"\nIn other words: wait and see. And hope that these criminals are doing a little more looking over their shoulders and second-guessing their communications in light of the last couple weeks. \u00ae", "hash": "3780d154e1d019d0b5c1707e6dbe11663c71013b94af6bdf46beb7efc9f0b399", "id": "f8a2bf08-58c1-4055-9943-b618a45b24ad", "link": "https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2024/05/17/cops_crime_winning/", "osint_source_id": "a94d3f15-5689-470c-9d1f-670b8c63491d", "published": "2024-05-17T11:37:11", "source": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/headlines.atom", "story_id": "76cf8844-8531-4a86-be1a-a81698044a93", "title": "First LockBit, now BreachForums: Are cops winning the war or just a few battles?"}], "tags": {"ALPHV": {"name": "ALPHV", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Berglas": {"name": "Berglas", "tag_type": "PER"}, "BreachForums": {"name": "BreachForums", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Brett Leatherman": {"name": "Brett Leatherman", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Conor Brian Fitzpatrick": {"name": "Conor Brian Fitzpatrick", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev": {"name": "Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev", "tag_type": "PER"}, "FBI": {"name": "FBI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Florida": {"name": "Florida", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Jon Clay": {"name": "Jon Clay", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Julian Assange": {"name": "Julian Assange", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Las Vegas": {"name": "Las Vegas", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "LockBit": {"name": "LockBit", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "LulzSec": {"name": "LulzSec", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "McPherson": {"name": "McPherson", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Michael McPherson": {"name": "Michael McPherson", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Russia": {"name": "Russia", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Sabu": {"name": "Sabu", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Scattered Spider": {"name": "Scattered Spider", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Scattered Spider ": {"name": "Scattered Spider ", "tag_type": "APT"}, "Silk Road": {"name": "Silk Road", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "TLDR": {"name": "TLDR", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Tampa": {"name": "Tampa", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Trend Micro": {"name": "Trend Micro", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "First LockBit, now BreachForums: Are cops winning the war or just a few battles?"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T17:11:33.566081", "id": "3a3a43b3-c091-4831-b880-b9fdddd0d613", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}, {"created": "2024-05-17T17:14:16.913939", "id": "4595ab4f-b913-442b-8719-e298e98f7618", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "13"}], "created": "2024-05-17T11:34:07", "id": "3f2f52c2-dff2-440a-9827-14d1e0243b4f", "news_items": [{"author": "Zeljka Zorz", "content": "US exposes scheme enabling North Korean IT workers to bypass sanctions\nThe US Justice Department had unsealed charges against a US woman and an Ukranian man who, along with three unidentified foreign nationals, have allegedly helped North Korean IT workers work remotely for US companies under assumed US identities and thus evade sanctions.\nAt the same time, the US State Department has announced that its Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program is offering \u201ca reward of up to $5 million for information that leads to the disruption of financial mechanisms of persons engaged in certain activities that support the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK),\u201d as well as for information about the three foreign nationals involved in this scheme.\nThe scheme\nAccording to the court documents, the conspirators defrauded over 300 US companies by using US payment platforms and online job site accounts, proxy computers located in the United States, and witting and unwitting US persons and entities.\n\u201cThe overseas IT workers gained employment [as software and applications developers] at US companies, including at a top-five major television network, a Silicon Valley technology company, an aerospace manufacturer, an American car manufacturer, a luxury retail store, and a US-hallmark media and entertainment company, all of which were Fortune 500 companies.

Seit Herbst vorigen Jahres steht das Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) offenbar bei Microsoft auf der Matte, um Informationen zu dessen Sicherheitsvorkehrungen zu bekommen. Nachdem Microsoft nicht lieferte und die Kommunikation immer weiter verschleppte, griff das BSI dann zu seinem sch\u00e4rfsten Schwert: Paragraf 7a des BSI-Gesetzes, mit dem es unter anderem die Herausgabe von Informationen einklagen kann. Das wurde jetzt durch ein Leak aus dem Digitalausschuss des Bundestags bekannt.\nDas Auskunftsbegehren steht im Kontext der eklatanten Sicherheitsvorf\u00e4lle bei Microsoft, bei denen staatliche Angreifer mehrfach Informationen von Microsoft selbst, aber auch von deren Cloud-Kunden abgreifen konnten. Konkret geht es um den Diebstahl des Master-Keys zur Microsoft-Cloud. Die vom US-amerikanischen Department of Homeland Security (DHS) eingesetzte Untersuchungskommission diagnostizierte in diesem Fall bereits ein Komplettversagen Microsofts. Mit denen sprach Microsoft immerhin; gegen\u00fcber dem BSI hingegen hakte der Informationsfluss so sehr, dass die deutsche Beh\u00f6rde ihre Nachfragen schrittweise immer weiter eskalierten.\nHarsche Kritik an Microsoft\n\"Das BSI hat im weiteren Verlauf der fachlichen Auseinandersetzung mit Microsoft den formellen Weg der Anordnung beschritten, weil die Angaben, die das BSI zuvor in einem regul\u00e4ren Austausch erhalten hat, nicht zufriedenstellend waren\", erkl\u00e4rte ein Sprecher des BSI gegen\u00fcber heise Security das Vorgehen. Konkret ging es dem BSI dabei unter anderem um den Einsatz der sogenannten Double Key Encryption, die eigentlich einen Datenabfluss zumindest in speziell gesicherten Umgebungen h\u00e4tte verhindern k\u00f6nnen. Denn bei diesem Verfahren werden die Daten mit zwei Schl\u00fcsseln chiffriert, von denen einer immer beim Kunden verbleibt. Doch die Details dazu sind so unklar, dass man beim BSI offenbar nicht einsch\u00e4tzen kann, ob die Angreifer nicht eventuell doch Klartextdaten abgreifen konnten.\nAuch auf wiederholte Nachfragen und Androhung einer Klage lieferte Microsoft die angeforderten Informationen dazu nicht. Daher nutze das BSI jetzt die ihm zur Verf\u00fcgung stehenden rechtlichen Instrumente, erl\u00e4utert der BSI-Sprecher, der nach wie vor Informationsbedarf sieht. Er verweist dabei auch explizit auf die harsche Kritik des US-amerikanischen Cyber Security Review Boards, dessen Einsch\u00e4tzung das BSI teile. \"Das BSI sieht, dass andere Cloud-Anbieter besser aufgestellt sind, was die technische Realisierung von Sicherheit angeht und wie sie reagieren, wenn es zu einem IT-Sicherheitsvorfall kommt\" lautet auch sein Fazit.\nParagraf 7 des BSIG\nIn Paragraf 7 des BSI-Gesetzes geht es um Warnungen durch das BSI. Paragraf 7a regelt die dazu n\u00f6tige \"Untersuchung der Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik\"; demnach kann das Bundesamt \"von Herstellern informationstechnischer Produkte und Systeme alle notwendigen Ausk\u00fcnfte, insbesondere auch zu technischen Details, verlangen\". Genau das hat das BSI offenbar getan und berichtete dar\u00fcber im Digitalausschuss des Deutschen Bundestags. Von dort leckten die Informationen anscheinend zum Spiegel, der weitere Details dazu berichtet.\nAnmerkung in eigener Sache: Der Autor dieses Artikels hatte angesichts der Aktivit\u00e4ten der US-amerikanischen CISA und der scheinbaren Unt\u00e4tigkeit des BSI vor einer \"gef\u00e4hrlichen Bei\u00dfhemmung gegen\u00fcber Microsoft\" gewarnt. Das m\u00f6chte ich hiermit zur\u00fccknehmen \u2013 ich bin \"officially impressed\" von der aktuellen Vorgehensweise und sehr gespannt, was da weiter herauskommt.\n(ju)", "hash": "be8fbd555119e5a1ce69f6bc6580699f98c0a20e7ffa38940b761538184f4a63", "id": "7251e0bd-509f-4777-b7d0-96ec2db6100b", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/BSI-verklagt-Microsoft-auf-Herausgabe-von-Informationen-zu-Security-Desaster-9721245.html?wt_mc=rss.red.security.security.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "c2c6d572-40f6-4271-ade8-596b8f44c6bb", "published": "2024-05-17T11:17:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/security/rss/news-atom.xml", "story_id": "40ca9ff4-1b57-4d5a-b9c9-4eab5fe454e9", "title": "BSI verklagt Microsoft auf Herausgabe von Informationen zu Security-Desaster"}], "tags": {"BSI": {"name": "BSI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "BSIG": {"name": "BSIG", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik": {"name": "Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Bundestags": {"name": "Bundestags", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CISA": {"name": "CISA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "DHS": {"name": "DHS", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "US-amerikanischen Department of Homeland Security": {"name": "US-amerikanischen Department of Homeland Security", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "BSI verklagt Microsoft auf Herausgabe von Informationen zu Security-Desaster"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T17:12:47.616510", "id": "607f2e5b-599a-4a14-9429-07bb63628c56", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-17T17:15:32.919110", "id": "4f097e3b-f677-4da9-a018-6b3d2694d57c", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "5"}], "created": "2024-05-17T11:09:17", "id": "78186c2d-ffcc-4a59-9324-1055d33b474e", "news_items": [{"author": "Bruce Schneier", "content": "FBI Seizes BreachForums Website\nThe FBI has seized the BreachForums website, used by ransomware criminals to leak stolen corporate data.\nIf law enforcement has gained access to the hacking forum\u2019s backend data, as they claim, they would have email addresses, IP addresses, and private messages that could expose members and be used in law enforcement investigations.\n[\u2026]\nThe FBI is requesting victims and individuals contact them with information about the hacking forum and its members to aid in their investigation.\nThe seizure messages include ways to contact the FBI about the seizure, including an email, a Telegram account, a TOX account, and a dedicated page hosted on the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).\n\u201cThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating the criminal hacking forums known as BreachForums and Raidforums,\u201d reads a dedicated subdomain on the FBI\u2019s IC3 portal.\n\u201cFrom June 2023 until May 2024, BreachForums (hosted at breachforums.st/.cx/.is/.vc and run by ShinyHunters) was operating as a clear-net marketplace for cybercriminals to buy, sell, and trade contraband, including stolen access devices, means of identification, hacking tools, breached databases, and other illegal services.\u201d\n\u201cPreviously, a separate version of BreachForums (hosted at breached.vc/.to/.co and run by pompompurin) operated a similar hacking forum from March 2022 until March 2023.

It\u2019s hard to understand why this is so \u2014 EDM is electrically and mechanically more complicated than traditional subtractive manufacturing techniques, so a plug-and-play EDM setup seems always just out of reach.\nOr perhaps not, if this 3D printed 4-axis wire EDM machine catches on. It comes to us from [John] at Rack Robotics and is built around the Powercore EDM power supply that we\u2019ve previously featured. Since wire EDM is a process that requires the workpiece to be completely immersed in a dielectric solution, the machine, dubbed \u201cBetta,\u201d is designed to fit inside a 10-gallon aquarium \u2014 get it?\nA lot of thought went into keeping costs down. for example, rather than use expensive sealed motors, [John] engineered the double CoreXY platform to keep the motors out of the water bath using long drive shafts and sealed bearings. The wire handling mechanism is also quite simple, at least compared to commercial WEDM machines, and uses standard brass EDM wire. The video below shows the machine going to town of everything from aluminum to steel, with fantastic results on thin or thick stock.\nWhile Rack Robotics is going to be offering complete kits, they\u2019re also planning on open-sourcing all the build files. We\u2019re eager to see where this leads, and if people will latch onto EDM with the same gusto they did with 3D printing.\n18 thoughts on \u201cBetta Aims To Bring Wire EDM To The Desktop\u201d\nDon\u2019t really know much about manufacturing so its the first I\u2019ve heard of wire EDM. Seems pretty cool.\nAs I grow older and my projects start getting more complex, I am realising that a \u201cgood\u201d design is one which can be manufactured with the most ease. Manufacturing techniques are very interesting!\nThe future is here with at-home factories. Everything hand-made and available on etsy.\nAs someone who is actively working on building a homebrew wire EDM (and has been off and on for years), I LOVE to see a post like this one. Keep us updated!\nIf you want to see the level of precision EDM can produce\nhttp://moroknives.com/infinity.html\nNot Found\nThe requested document was not found on this server.\nThe Web Server\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20240222010525/http://moroknives.com/infinity.html\nSome electrical info on the necessary power supply for EDM from a project I did years ago:\nhttps://cscott.net/Projects/FabClass/final/edesign1.html\nI never got that one finished\u2013i got stuck on the mechanical side. The entire workspace need to be not just wet but /flowing/ in order to properly flush chips and prevent bridging between the tool and the workpiece, which (combined with the primitive state of rep raps at the time) was a substantial barrier for me. So I\u2019m most excited about the mechanical parts of this project! If those can be solved, there\u2019s a lot of fun you can have on the drive electronics side, and these days those electronics once perfected can be easily mass produced for cheap. Ah the march of progress.\nAwesome!\nvery nicely done. Would be interesting to see the final box ready product and beg my wife to allow me to have one.\nThere\u2019s a better way. Find a project she wants and point out how much cheaper you can do it if you had a wire EDM machine. You\u2019re doing her a favour by buying one and the first project is for her.\nThe first thing I printed on my 3d printer was a love symbol to my wife. Nothing fancy, but believe it or not she keeps it in a safe place because of what it means to her.\nTwo thousand US Dollars for a preorder. Plus another 400 for the power supply?\nDare I say that\u2019s a bit steep? I could sell the wife on it if they kept to the high-three-figures\u2026\n$2000 includes everything. The Powercore V2 is built into this price\n\u201cI could sell the wife\u201d\nI don\u2019t think that would be legal,\nIf it is, we\u2019d probably want to see some photos before bidding.\nB^)\nHe didn\u2019t state the country, and sadly it\u2019s probably not illegal in many countries.\nI ordered a portable EDM when I worked at a factory for about $4k in yr 2000 dollars. It only had an active Z axis and was designed for burning out broken taps and bolts. The work didn\u2019t have to be immersed though. The flush fluid was pumped through the hollow carbon electrode and you\u2019d recover it whatever way you could. Actually used it to burn out broken taps overhead several times.\nA hole popper\n6:10 in the video \u2013 that gear isn\u2019t even close to correct, but I assume that\u2019s because he didn\u2019t take the time to setup the cut correctly.\nThe machine overall is a huge step forward from previous attempts. I\u2019ll definitely be following this.\nWould be great to have it at 48v rather than 65v. That would make it far easier to get into small labs and schools. 65v unfortunately trips the HSE brigade into overdrive\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

F\u00fcr Apple liefen sie gar nicht so schlecht.\nBei der Vorstellung des iPad Pro M4 betonte Apple mehrfach, wie d\u00fcnn die Hardware ist. Selbst den schmalen iPod nano von 2012 habe man geschlagen. Dennoch sei das Tablet dank eines \u00fcberarbeiteten internen Aufbaus sehr stabil. Nun, das neue iPad ist seit Mittwoch im Handel und da war es nur eine Frage der (kurzen) Zeit, bis erste YouTuber Apple beim Wort nehmen und dies \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen: Die ersten Biegetests sind da.\nSchwarze Magie an struktureller Integrit\u00e4t?\nDass die kommen werden, d\u00fcrfte auch Apple gewusst haben. Ein \"Bendgate 3.0\" wird aber wahrscheinlich ausbleiben: Das neue Profi-iPad ist tats\u00e4chlich erstaunlich resistent gegen Verbiegungen. Der bekannt Hardware-Qu\u00e4ler Zack Nelson von JerryRigEverything machte den Anfang. Seiner Ansicht nach hielt das Ger\u00e4t sich erstaunlich gut. Er sehe \"ein verd\u00e4chtiges Niveau an struktureller Integrit\u00e4t, die an schwarze Magie grenzt\". Dennoch gelang es schlie\u00dflich, das Ger\u00e4t zu zerbrechen, das Bildschirmglas sprang ab. Vertikaler Druck ist allerdings problematischer, hier kam es zum Bruch, der offenbar vom USB-C-Anschluss ausging.\nLob gab es f\u00fcr Apples neues \"Cowling\" der Hauptplatine plus ein integriertes \"R\u00fcckgrat\", das das ganze iPad Pro M4 herunter verl\u00e4uft. Dieses sorge daf\u00fcr, dass es gut gesch\u00fctzt ist, meint auch ein zweiter Biegetester, der YouTuber Sam Kohl. MobileReviewsEh nutzt schlie\u00dflich auch professionelles Werkzeug, um das iPad Pro M4 zu verbiegen. Der komplette Zusammenbruch erfolgte nach knapp 30 Kilogramm bei in der Mitte platziertem Druck. Problematisch bleiben Biegeversuche an den Seiten, hier ist es deutlich einfacher. Dennoch glauben alle Tester, dass das neue iPad den Alltag auch ohne H\u00fclle \u00fcberstehen d\u00fcrfte \u2013 trotz der D\u00fcnnheit.\nNeue Hardware, neue Beschichtung\nDas iPad Pro M4 kostet mindestens 1199 Euro in der 11-Zoll-Variante. Diese ist leicht dicker als das 13-Zoll-Modell, das mindestens 1549 Euro kostet. Das Chassis ist aus Aluminium gefertigt und wird in den Farben Silber und \"Space Schwarz\" offeriert. Apple baut in den neuen Tablets neben dem M4 erstmals auch ein OLED-Display gr\u00f6\u00dferen Ausma\u00dfes ein \u2013 bislang gab es diese nur im iPhone und der Apple Watch.\nF\u00fcr die Modelle mit 1 TByte und 2 TByte bietet Apple gegen Aufpreis auch das sogenannte Nanotexturglas an, es soll f\u00fcr geringere Spiegelungen sorgen. Es ist davon auszugehen, dass auch dieser \u00dcberzug ausf\u00fchrlichen Zerst\u00f6rungstests unterzogen wird.\nEmpfohlener redaktioneller Inhalt\nMit Ihrer Zustimmmung wird hier ein externer Preisvergleich (heise Preisvergleich) geladen.\nIch bin damit einverstanden, dass mir externe Inhalte angezeigt werden.

"content": "Cybercriminals who have been using the Black Basta ransomware have been observed abusing the remote management tool Quick Assist in vishing (voice phishing) attacks, Microsoft reports.\nActive since 2022 and believed to have hit over 500 organizations globally, Black Basta is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) that likely received over $100 million in ransom payments from its victims.\nLast week, the US government warned of Black Basta affiliates targeting numerous critical infrastructure organizations in North America, Europe, and Australia, including healthcare entities, and using social engineering and the exploitation of known vulnerabilities for initial access.\nStarting mid-April 2024, the Black Basta threat actors have been observed conducting vishing attacks in which they impersonate IT or help desk personnel to convince victims to install legitimate remote monitoring and management tools that are then abused for malware deployment.\nAccording to Microsoft, the threat actors were seen installing tools such as ScreenConnect and NetSupport Manager, which were followed by the deployment of Qakbot, Cobalt Strike, and Black Basta ransomware.\nThe attacks started with Black Basta threat actors signing up the victim\u2019s email address to multiple email subscription services to flood their inbox, and then impersonating IT support in phone calls allegedly meant to help the targeted individual resolve the issue.\nDuring the phone call, the attackers convinced the victim to provide access to their device through Quick Assist, a Microsoft application that allows users to share their devices via a remote connection, providing the remote party with the ability to view the display or take full control, typically for troubleshooting.\n\u201cThreat actors misuse Quick Assist features to perform social engineering attacks by pretending, for example, to be a trusted contact like Microsoft technical support or an IT professional from the target user\u2019s company to gain initial access to a target device,\u201d Microsoft explains.\nOnce the user enabled screen sharing through Quick Assist, the attacker requested full control over the device and, after the user approved it, executed a command to deploy the malicious payloads, including batch scripts that install fake spam filters that requested the victim\u2019s credentials.\nIn some of the observed attacks, Qakbot was deployed on the victim\u2019s system to deliver a Cobalt Strike implant attributed to the Black Basta threat actors.\nFurthermore, the attackers used ScreenConnect to gain persistence and move laterally, and followed up with hands-on-keyboard activities, including domain enumeration and the deployment of ransomware across the network, using PsExec.\nMicrosoft says it will help mitigate the abuse of Quick Assist in malicious attacks by incorporating alerts to inform users of possible tech support scams.\nRelated: Shields Up: How to Minimize Ransomware Exposure\nRelated: LockBit Ransomware Mastermind Unmasked, Charged\nRelated: US, Israel Provide Guidance on Securing Remote Access Software",

One sheriff\u2019s department in Louisiana has repeatedly tested the system, called Orion, which is already in use by the Israeli national police and, since October 7, many Israeli settlements, according to the company\u2019s founder.\nCreated by the Israeli company High Lander, Orion allows users to direct hundreds of drones at once by automating them to navigate and perform actions without user input. The software system turns drones into \u201cnext-generation security guards,\u201d according to an Orion brochure.\nIn February, High Lander held a demo event in Baton Rouge to showcase the \u201cdrone-in-a-box solution,\u201d which the East Baton Rouge Sherrif\u2019s Office first tested out last June. \u201cThe system will be a game changer for the fight against crime in Baton Rouge,\u201d High Lander wrote in a LinkedIn post about the event, which was attended by officers from around the country.\nThe company has used its pilot program in Louisiana to encourage other police agencies to check out Orion, and its February event in Louisiana was just one part of a tour that included stops in San Diego, Phoenix, and Miami, according to LinkedIn posts.\nOrion\u2019s capabilities are startling. A police force could have drones automatically launch from charging stations when triggered by \u201cevents like gunshots, burglaries, and car accidents.\u201d Once they deploy, the drones can perform pre-set tasks: releasing cargo; relaying live video feeds; identifying and searching for people, objects, or vehicles using AI and thermal sensors; and making announcements over loudspeaker. If the system gets multiple calls, Orion can automatically choose which to prioritize.\nA High Lander blog post about the project adds \u201cnew capabilities are being discovered all the time.\u201d\nThe East Baton Rouge Sheriff\u2019s Office held \u201cmock scenario testing\u201d with High Lander\u2019s system \u201capproximately 5 times,\u201d Casey Hicks, the department\u2019s public information director, told The Intercept. Hicks added that the demos were conducted at the sheriff\u2019s range facility and that they \u201care not aware of any use out in the community at any time.\u201d\nHigh Lander did not respond to a request for comment.\nThere is a documented history of U.S.-Israel security tech exchanges, which civil rights and racial justice advocates have long criticized for contributing to the militarization of the police. The Tel Aviv-based High Lander collaborated with Stephenson Technologies Corporation, a Louisiana nonprofit that works with the departments of Defense and Homeland Security, to bring Orion to East Baton Rouge, with up to $1 million in backing from the Israel\u2013U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation. That funding comes from an endowment provided equally by the U.S. and Israeli governments.\n\u201cPeople should be really concerned that our tax dollars are often being put right in the pockets of American and Israeli tech millionaires or billionaires, and that those technologies are then used on us and our neighbors to make people more unsafe,\u201d said Lou Blumberg, an organizer with both Jewish Voice for Peace and Eye on Surveillance, an organization that monitors the adoption of surveillance technology in New Orleans.\n\u201cThis technology that\u2019s coming out of Israel is heavily implicated in human rights abuses,\u201d Blumberg said, \u201cbecause you can\u2019t separate the tech from the apartheid.\u201d\nFrom Israel to Louisiana\nIn East Baton Rouge, High Lander and Stephenson Technologies integrated the drone platform \u201cwith the city of Baton Rouge\u2019s citywide system of gunshot sensors\u201d for testing by the sheriff\u2019s department, according to High Lander\u2019s website. In a December post about the project, the company quoted an employee who said \u201cit was a great feeling to see that first autonomous dispatch.\u201d\nThe city uses ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection technology recently dropped by the city of Chicago due to critiques of racist bias and inaccuracy.\nThe East Baton Rouge Sheriff\u2019s Office has long been accused of mistreating and harassing people of color \u2014 including using acoustic weapons on protesters without proper training \u2014 raising concerns among local advocates about its use of Orion.\nWhen Israeli security tech is exported to the United States, it is \u201cused to surveil and criminalize, mostly, young Black boys,\u201d said Blumberg. Pointing to other types of surveillance technology, including facial recognition, Blumberg added, \u201cThere\u2019s actually no statistical evidence that it helps prevent crimes\u201d or \u201cthat it helps make people safer.\u201d\nThe head of training at the East Baton Rouge Sheriff\u2019s Office, Carl Dabadie, participated in a police training program in Israel about a decade ago \u2014 and promised to bring his learnings back to the local community.\nThe Anti-Defamation League invited Dabadie, then the chief of the Baton Rouge Police Department, to attend a National Counter-Terrorism Seminar in Israel in 2014. Seeking airfare for the training, Dabadie said there are \u201cseveral terrrist targets\u201d [sic] in Baton Rouge, apparently referring to local oil refineries, according to a document obtained through a public records request. He returned from the eight-day seminar, during which participants visited an Israeli police department in Jerusalem and a border outpost, and told local media he had plans to update the department\u2019s riot gear.\n\u201cInstead of real bullets and shooting at people, they use foam bullets, tear gas, shields, and even paintballs,\u201d he enthused.\nDabadie left the police department in the wake of his violent handling of protests over the 2016 police killing of Alton Sterling, which earned condemnations from Amnesty International and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and of Association. Still, Dabadie defended \u201cour militarized tactics and our militarized law enforcement.\u201d In 2020, he was made head of training for the sheriff\u2019s office.\nProtesters and civil rights groups sued several police departments and officials, including Dabadie and East Baton Rouge Sheriff Sid Gautreaux III, for violating their civil rights during the 2016 protests.\nIn court proceedings stemming from one of the lawsuits, an officer testified that police had \u201cfooled around\u201d with a crowd-dispersing acoustic weapon and used it against protesters without sufficient training. (Those plaintiffs were awarded a $1.2 million settlement last year.)\nThe lawyer who filed that lawsuit, William Most, told The Intercept that the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s track record makes him concerned about its use of an autonomous drone system.\n\u201cGiven EBRSO\u2019s past trouble in complying with the Constitution, I would be concerned about it adopting a drone program without clear safeguards to protect the rights of Baton Rouge residents,\u201d said Most.\nIn Israel, meanwhile, High Lander\u2019s business has flourished amid Israel\u2019s retaliatory war on Gaza. After October 7, Israel passed an emergency measure saying that civilian drones can return to the skies only if they are connected to an approved unmanned traffic management, or UTM, system. High Lander became the first approved UTM system in Israel. (The country\u2019s Air Force previously tested the company\u2019s drone technology.)\nThe drones have \u201ccounter-drone\u201d measures that can take over and land enemy drones, and detect the location of their controllers. In an April presentation, High Lander\u2019s co-founder Alon Abelson, a former Israeli Air Force commander, describes a scenario in which Orion allows users to deploy \u201chundreds of PTZ [pan-tilt-zoom] cameras that hover and relay images from the air,\u201d a surveillance capacity he described as unprecedented.\nThe company relies on hundreds of sensors around Israel, Abelson said in his talk, allowing them to turn drone fleets \u201cinto part of an information-sharing system that did not exist before.\u201d The system allows settlements\u2019 drones to automatically launch from chargers when triggered by cameras, smoke detectors, or \u201csmart fences.\u201d Since October 7, he said, \u201cwe have provided this system to hundreds of settlements throughout the country.\u201d", "hash": "80e371ebddd534334632b1466f2925c25b418f1b1818998640f82824177d98a9", "id": "de97aa50-315f-4c98-849d-51873bf42908", "link": "https://theintercept.com/2024/05/17/israel-orione-drone-us-police-louisiana/", "osint_source_id": "a87d9c83-841f-455b-9e28-f8d5df3a6fb5", "published": "2024-05-17T10:00:00", "source": "https://theintercept.com/feed/?rss", "story_id": "3709f998-3e97-497c-8d83-4448671b6c11", "title": "An Israeli Company Is Hawking Its Self-Launching Drone System to U.S. Police Departments"}], "tags": {"Abelson": {"name": "Abelson", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Air Force": {"name": "Air Force", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Alon Abelson": {"name": "Alon Abelson", "tag_type": "PER"}, "American": {"name": "American", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Amnesty International": {"name": "Amnesty International", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Blumberg": {"name": "Blumberg", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Carl Dabadie": {"name": "Carl Dabadie", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Casey Hicks": {"name": "Casey Hicks", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Chicago": {"name": "Chicago", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Dabadie": {"name": "Dabadie", "tag_type": "PER"}, "EBRSO": {"name": "EBRSO", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Gaza": {"name": "Gaza", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Hicks": {"name": "Hicks", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Israel": {"name": "Israel", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Israeli": {"name": "Israeli", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Jerusalem": {"name": "Jerusalem", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "LinkedIn": {"name": "LinkedIn", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Lou Blumberg": {"name": "Lou Blumberg", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Louisiana": {"name": "Louisiana", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Miami": {"name": "Miami", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "New Orleans": {"name": "New Orleans", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Orion": {"name": "Orion", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Phoenix": {"name": "Phoenix", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "San Diego": {"name": "San Diego", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Stephenson Technologies Corporation": {"name": "Stephenson Technologies Corporation", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "U.S.": {"name": "U.S.", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "United States": {"name": "United States", "tag_type": "Country"}, "William Most": {"name": "William Most", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "An Israeli Company Is Hawking Its Self-Launching Drone System to U.S. Police Departments"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T17:16:16.071722", "id": "3729a03f-10c3-420e-b89f-bdafdc88bc01", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}, {"created": "2024-05-17T17:18:10.393959", "id": "cf4945aa-c5c2-4b04-8ef5-072f5c2d7d37", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "3"}], "created": "2024-05-17T10:00:00", "id": "0e0bf2b5-0b63-4cc2-82ce-11a4d7b2abd6", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Am 9.

The security policy feature is a critical building block for the trustworthy orchestration of confidential Kubernetes workloads on IaaS platforms. The feature protects the interface between the cloud provider\u2019s stack and the user's trusted computing base (TCB). The user's confidential workloads run inside the TCB within virtual machines (VMs) which are encrypted by a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), such as AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). Trust in the security policy and its enforcement can be established via remote attestation. We will explore establishing this trust and how end users can generate and apply security policies using our new genpolicy tool.\n \nProtecting the Trust Boundary Interface\n \nFigure 1: Simplified overview of the components of the Confidential Containers computing stack.\n \nOne of the main components of the Kata Containers system architecture is the Kata Agent, which we will refer to as Agent. When using Kata Containers to implement Confidential Containers, the Agent is executed inside the hardware-based TEE and therefore is part of the TCB. As shown in the Figure 1, the Agent provides a set of ttRPC APIs allowing the system components outside of the TEE, i.e., the Kata Shim, to create and manage Kubernetes pods inside confidential VMs (CVMs) transparent to the Kubernetes stack. From a confidentiality standpoint, the Kata Shim to Agent communication represents a control channel crossing the TCB boundary, which is why the Agent must protect itself from potentially malicious Agent API calls. \nTo systematically secure this control channel, we designed and implemented a security policy feature for the Kata Containers project, known as the Kata \u201cAgent Policy\u201d feature. This feature allows the owner of a confidential pod deployment to specify a document articulating the security policy a priori to running the pod. This policy document dictates what API calls are allowed and disallowed for the pod.\nThe policy document can be added in the form of an encoded string as an annotation to Kubernetes pod manifests, allowing the policy document to naturally travel through kubelet and containerd to the Kata Shim, which we will refer to as Shim. The Shim then provides the policy document to the Agent during early CVM initialization. Since the policy document travels through components that are not part of the TCB prior to reaching the Agent, the policy is not inherently trustworthy at CVM initialization. We can establish trustworthiness through remote attestation which will be explained in an upcoming section.\n \nStructure of the Security Policy Document\nThe security policy document is composed using the Rego policy language and describes all the Agent\u2019s ttRPC API calls along with their parameters that are expected for creating and managing the confidential pod. This section takes a closer look at the three high-level sections of the policy document \u2013 the rules, default values and data sections.\n \nRules\nThe rules section is a static part of the policy document, independent of the individual pod deployment. Rules express the semantics for validating API calls, and in particular implement input parameter validation for parametrized calls. An example for a simple rule is the one for the unparametrized WriteStreamRequest call which explicitly enforces that the call can only be made if the policy document\u2019s default value for the call is set to true:\n \nWriteStreamRequest {\n    policy_data.request_defaults.WriteStreamRequest == true\n}\n \nLet\u2019s now look at a rule for the parametrized CreateContainerRequest call which implements input parameter validation:\n \nCreateContainerRequest {\n    i_oci := input.OCI\n    i_storages := input.storages\n    ...\n\n    some p_container in policy_data.containers\n\n    p_pidns := p_container.sandbox_pidns\n    i_pidns := input.sandbox_pidns\n    p_pidns == i_pidns\n\n    p_oci := p_container.OCI\n\n    p_oci.Version == i_oci.Version\n    p_oci.Root.Readonly == i_oci.Root.Readonly\n    ...\n\n    p_storages := p_container.storages\n    ...\n}\n \nThis rule validates all input parameters by comparing them with the expected parameters based on the document\u2019s data section and rejects when a change to fields like the command line, storage mount, execution security context, or environment variables is detected. In the code snippet, the variables starting with \u201ci_\u201d are the input parameters whereas the variables starting with \u201cp_\u201d represent the expected values based on the policy document\u2019s data section.\n \nDefault Values\nDefault values for API calls determine the behavior when no rule for a given call was positively evaluated:\n \ndefault CreateContainerRequest := false\n \nThe default value of false means that any CreateContainer API call will be rejected unless a set of policy rules explicitly allows that call.\n \ndefault GuestDetailsRequest := true\n\u00a0\nThe default value of true means that calls from outside of the TEE to the GuestDetailsRequest API are always allowed to be executed. One would set this default value to true when the data returned by this API is not considered sensitive for confidentiality of the workloads.\n\u00a0\nData\nThe data section contains expected values that are derived from a Kubernetes pod manifest and that are compared during policy rule evaluation with the actual values from the input parameters of a\u00a0ttRPC API request. With this, the data section directly depends on the individual pod deployment with its containers. Based on the result of the comparison between the values, a rule can either allow or deny the call by returning\u00a0true\u00a0or\u00a0false.\nComing back to the above rule for CreateContainerRequest, all the characteristics of a container are specified in a fine-granular way in the policy document\u2019s data section: image integrity information, command line, storage volumes and mounts, the execution security context, environment variables, and other fields from the Open Container Initiative (OCI) container runtime configuration. An example for the command line section is the following:\n\u00a0\npolicy_data := {\n    \"containers\": [\n        {\n            \"OCI\": {\n                    ...\n                    \"Args\": [\n                        \"/bin/sh\"\n                    ],\n                    ...\n                },\n                ...\n            },\n            ...\n\u00a0\nAny diverging command line observed in the CreateContainerRequest for the given container will be rejected by policy. Another example is for the validation of the storages input field of the CreateContainerRequest:\n\u00a0\npolicy_data := {\n    \"containers\": [\n        {\n            \"OCI\": {\n                ...\n            },\n            \"storages\": [\n                {\n                    \"driver\": \"blk\",\n                    \"driver_options\": [],\n                    \"source\": \"\",\n                    \"fstype\": \"tar\",\n                    \"options\": [\n                        \"$(hash0)\"\n                    ],\n                    \"mount_point\": \"$(layer0)\",\n                    \"fs_group\": null\n                },\n                ...\n\u00a0\nThis example shows how the security policy constrains the way block devices can be mapped from the host into the CVM. In this example, a tar filesystem type block device is expected to be mapped to a certain mount point into the CVM.\n\u00a0\nPolicy Enforcement in the Kata Agent\nThe Agent is responsible for enforcing the security policy by evaluating the policy for each Agent ttRPC API call. We implemented the enforcement of the security policy using the Open Policy Agent (OPA) \u2013 a graduated project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Before carrying out the actions corresponding to the API, the Agent queries\u00a0OPA\u00a0by using the\u00a0OPA REST API to check if the policy rules and data allow or block the call. The Agent provides the policy document and all input\u00a0data from the API request parameters as a\u00a0JSON\u00a0format representation to OPA. OPA uses the rules to check if the inputs are consistent with policy data. OPA\u00a0tries to find at least one rule with the same name as the ttRPC API call to return\u00a0true\u00a0while considering the call\u2019s potential input parameters.\nFor example, when the Agent receives a\u00a0CreateContainerRequest\u00a0call, any rules defined in the policy that are using the name\u00a0CreateContainerRequest\u00a0are evaluated.\u00a0OPA\u00a0evaluates these rules and tries to find at least one\u00a0CreateContainerRequest rule that returns value\u00a0true. If at least one CreateContainerRequest rule returns true, OPA returns a true result to the Agent, and the Agent creates the container as requested by the Shim. On the other hand, if the API inputs are not allowed by the document\u2019s rules or if no rule exists, OPA returns the default value for that API to the Agent, or false when no default value is supplied. In the case false is returned, the Agent rejects the API call by returning a \u201cblocked by policy\u201d error message.\nWe achieved this behavior by adding a gate to the Agent\u2019s RPC interface implementation for each call. We added the is_allowed() function call early in every call handler:\n\u00a0\nasync fn exec_process(\u2026) -> ttrpc::Result<Empty> {\n    ...\n    is_allowed(&req).await?;\n    ...\n}\n\u00a0\nThe function enforces above-described logic and can be found in the Agent policy implementation.\nAn important policy enforcement aspect of the CreateContainerRequest call is the Agent\u2019s protection of the integrity of block devices, as described in the example for the storages input field of the CreateContainerRequest from the previous section and replicated below.\n\u00a0\npolicy_data := {\n    \"containers\": [\n        {\n            \"OCI\": {\n                ...\n            },\n            \"storages\": [\n                {\n                    \"driver\": \"blk\",\n                    \"driver_options\": [],\n                    \"source\": \"\",\n                    \"fstype\": \"tar\",\n                    \"options\": [\n                        \"$(hash0)\"\n                    ],\n                    \"mount_point\": \"$(layer0)\",\n                    \"fs_group\": null\n                },\n                ...\n\u00a0\nAs each container image layer is exposed as a read-only virtio block device to the CVM, the Agent protects the integrity of these block devices using the dm-verity technology of the CVM\u2019s Linux kernel, enforcing the root value of the dm-verity hash tree through policy enforcement. The policy document\u2019s data section contains the expected root values of the dm-verity hash tree for each container image layer, hash0 in the above example. These root values are verified at runtime by the Agent via calling OPA to compare the received input values with the expected values using policy rules semantics as defined by the policy document. With this, not only the security policy enforcement but also the integrity of the container image layers can be verified by remote attestation, as described next.\n\u00a0\nSecurity Policy and Remote Attestation\nBefore handling sensitive information, confidential workloads should perform remote attestation to prove to any relying party that exactly the desired workload with the user\u2019s desired policy, using exactly the expected versions of the TEE, and of the CVM\u2019s software stack has been orchestrated by the control plane.\nFigure 2 depicts the confidential container creation flow starting with a user deploying a pod manifest to running the workload in the CVM. The pod manifest depicted in orange color reaches the Shim which in turn brings up the CVM with the help of the VMM and HV. The Shim uses the CreateVM call the VMM exposes through its API.\n\u00a0\nFigure 2: Simplified CVM and container creation flow of Confidential Container implementations.\n\u00a0\nBefore triggering this call, the Shim computes the SHA256 hash of the user-provided policy document that the VMM uses to set a field measured by the TEE. In the case of AMD SEV-SNP, the VMM sets the HOST_DATA field to the hash value which the AMD SEV-SNP TEE includes in the attestation evidence. This action creates a strong binding between the contents of the policy and the CVM. This TEE field cannot be modified later by the software executed inside or outside of the CVM. However, it is readable within the TEE after launch.\nAs the Shim launches the CVM and the CVM OS boots, the Agent starts up using an initial security policy that is included in the CVMs root file system. This initial security policy only allows the Shim to set a new policy document through the SetPolicyRequest ttRPC call once the Agent\u2019s ttRPC interface becomes available. Upon receiving the policy from the Shim, the Agent verifies that the hash of the policy matches the value in the immutable TEE field. The Agent rejects the incoming policy if it detects a hash mismatch. If the hash matches, the Agent enforces the new policy and listens for ttRPC calls. After the Agent receives and validates the Shim\u2019s CreateContainerRequest call, the Agent creates the workload container pertaining to the user\u2019s pod manifest.\nThe remote attestation procedure can be implemented in different ways. One option is to implement in a container running inside the CVM that obtains the signed attestation evidence from the AMD SEV-SNP TEE. With the policy hash being part of one of the measured TEE fields above, the attestation service can verify the integrity of the security policy by comparing the value of this field with the expected hash of the pod policy that was preconfigured by the user. \nMicrosoft\u2019s Azure Attestation (MAA) provides an end-to-end attestation solution for workloads in Azure. We have added support for Confidential Containers on AKS to MAA by utilizing the open-source confidential sidecar container as the attestation client. So, MAA just needs to be seeded with relevant policy measurements for confidential pods to enable remote attestation.\n\u00a0\nPolicy Document Creation using the genpolicy Tool\nTo simplify creating the policy document for container workloads, we built the genpolicy tool to automate the generation of the security policy document with its policy data, rules, and default values derived from the users\u2019 individual Kubernetes pod manifests. The genpolicy tool encodes the security policy document in base64 format and adds it to the Kubernetes pod manifest as an annotation. An example is a pod manifest for Confidential Containers on AKS where the given runtimeClassName field indicates that the pod is to be run as a confidential container:\n\u00a0\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    io.katacontainers.config.agent.policy: cGFja2FnZSBhZ2VudF<...>\nspec:\n  runtimeClassName: kata-cc-isolation\n...\n\u00a0\nThe annotation value can be decoded using \u201cbase64 -d\u201d, revealing the set of default values, rules, and data, for example:\n\u00a0\n...\n# default values for API calls\ndefault CopyFileRequest := false\n...\ndefault ExecProcessRequest := false\n...\n\n# rules for API calls\nCreateContainerRequest { ... }\n...\nCreateSandboxRequest { ... }\n...\nWriteStreamRequest { ... }\n...\n\n# data, for instance listing the pod\u2019s containers and fields\npolicy_data := {\n  \"containers\": [\n    {\n      \"OCI\": {\n        \"Version\": \"1.1.0-rc.1\",\n  ...\n}\n\u00a0\nTo generate the policy, run the following command:\n\u00a0\ngenpolicy -y <path/to/pod.yaml>\n\u00a0\nThis will embed the policy into the pod yaml file. Then the pod manifest can be deployed onto a cluster supporting confidential containers as normal, for instance, using:\n\u00a0\nkubectl apply -f <path/to/pod.yaml>\n\u00a0\nIf any policy violations are detected, the Agent will refuse to execute the relevant ttRPC call, resulting in the following failure when using kubectl describe pod:\n\u00a0\nError: failed to create containerd task: failed to create shim task: \u201cCreateContainerRequest is blocked by policy\u201d\n\u00a0\nUsers should review the auto-generated policy document and verify that the policy fits the desired confidentiality goals and modify the policy as needed. To change the behavior of the tool, the user can specify further parameters:\n\u00a0\ngenpolicy -p <path/to/rules.rego> -j <path/to/genpolicy-settings.json> -y <path/to/pod.yaml>\n\u00a0\nUsing these parameters, the policy\u2019s default values and rules and data fields can be modified by supplying custom rules.rego and settings JSON files. More details and examples are provided in the upstream Kata Agent policy documentation.\nTo simplify genpolicy usage in Azure, the Azure CLI \u2018confcom\u2019 extension wraps the latest releases of the genpolicy tool to enable end users generating pod security policies via the Azure CLI, which is as simple as calling:\n\u00a0\naz confcom katapolicygen -y <path/to/pod.yaml>\n\u00a0\nAn end-to-end example starting with cluster deployment and running a confidential container with attached security policy can be found in our confidential container deployment documentation.\n\u00a0\nConclusion\nWe have walked through the security policy of our Confidential Containers on AKS offering - from the syntax of the policy file to the enforcement with OPA, to establishing trust with remote attestation, and how to automatically generate and embed the policy using our genpolicy tool. The Azure Linux team collaborated with the Confidential Containers and Kata Containers communities on the design and implementation of Confidential Containers, as part of Microsoft\u2019s commitment to open source. We contributed the policy implementation upstream - the Agent code responsible for enforcing the security policy, the Shim and Agent code for setting the policy and reading its measured hash value with different VMMs and HVs for AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX, and the genpolicy tool to create the security policy document. Along with this, a how-to for the policy feature and a README for the genpolicy tool can be found. We will continue to contribute and expand the security policy implementation upstream with the Kata Containers and Confidential Containers communities, so join us there to build this feature with us.", "hash": "791e708fb764c3c7447f0e509c998b0b044671f6e6d2671d83c2f520b03b6292", "id": "45bfcd26-63a0-4301-bb26-a1e66b64ab69", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/linux-and-open-source-blog/deep-dive-secure-orchestration-of-confidential-containers-on/ba-p/4137179", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-17T10:00:00", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "134347ad-d3e6-4aa0-b5ed-824c46db7fdb", "title": "Deep Dive: Secure Orchestration of Confidential Containers on Azure Kubernetes Service"}], "tags": {"Agent API": {"name": "Agent API", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Kubernetes": {"name": "Kubernetes", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Shim": {"name": "Shim", "tag_type": "PER"}, "TCB": {"name": "TCB", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "TEE": {"name": "TEE", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "VMMs": {"name": "VMMs", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "VMs": {"name": "VMs", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "WriteStreamRequest": {"name": "WriteStreamRequest", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Deep Dive: Secure Orchestration of Confidential Containers on Azure Kubernetes Service"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T17:26:00.281956", "id": "480b6346-41a3-4e2c-b434-443401a16d2d", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "4"}], "created": "2024-05-17T10:00:00", "id": "bfe7364a-ec8f-4be4-acd3-a3bf78a7e293", "news_items": [{"author": "msmash", "content": "Companies Are So Desperate For Data Centers They're Leasing Them Before They're Even Built (sherwood.news) 17\nData center construction levels are at an all-time high.

The worst thing that can happen during an incident is that your development and operations teams are blocked from solving the problem.\nThat\u2019s why having adequate identity access management (IAM) policies in place \u2013 which include both authorization (AuthZ) and authentication (AuthN) \u2013 is especially critical when it comes to your incident management tooling.\nThe difference between authentication and authorization\nThese two terms sound similar but they are distinct concepts, and your company needs to deal with both to ensure the security of your applications. To avoid confusion, it can be helpful to refer to authorization as \u201cpermissions\u201d more clearly distinguishing it from authentication.\nAuthentication is the first step \u2013 without it, the next step of managing permissions is pointless. Authentication involves verifying someone is who they say they are. Think about it as a bouncer at a VIP event checking IDs \u2013 they are the first buffer between the outside world and the inside. If your name is on the list and is verified by the ID, then you are allowed in.\nDuring an incident, where part of the challenge is making sure the right people are brought into the situation to remediate the issue, it\u2019s crucial that folks who need to make moves can do so without unnecessary bottlenecks and friction. If a developer has to wait until they hear back from the security team to unblock them, precious time is wasted as the application is down or a customer is affected.\nManaging permissions is the next step in the process. Once someone is verified and inside, what are they allowed to do? Are they cooks who should be allowed in the kitchen? Are they patrons who should only be allowed at the tables? Are they live band members and should have access to the green room? Just because someone is accepted into the party it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s appropriate for them to have complete access to every part of the venue.\nThe same thing is true for applications. People need the appropriate levels of access and permissions within the application to do what they need to do and what they are supposed to do, without the risk of abusing the system. As we all know, there are malicious actors even within companies, so it\u2019s critical for the health of your business that there are guardrails and parameters. Even well-intentioned folks can make mistakes, which can be devastating when dealing with security and customer-sensitive data.\nIt\u2019s the role of security teams to work together with platform teams to ensure that the appropriate access controls are in place. That way, everything can operate smoothly when an incident occurs, and the issue can be resolved without unnecessary chaos. You don\u2019t want to be in a situation where access is granted off the cuff or where someone should already have access and doesn\u2019t.\nManaging access control at scale\nEnsuring the right safeguards are in place around who can access which information becomes increasingly challenging as the amount of people and the granularity of access-controlled data increase. This is where SCIM (system for cross-domain identity management) comes in.\nSCIM automates the process of creating, updating, and deleting user accounts. This is especially useful in large organizations or those that use many cloud services, as it saves a time and effort that would otherwise be spent manually managing accounts. By using a standardized protocol, SCIM ensures that user information and permissions are consistent across different systems.\nThis helps reduce errors and ensure that security policies are applied uniformly and instantly when, for example, you are adding a new employee or remove an ex-employee from all systems. This rapid update across systems helps maintain security and operational efficiency.\nConsiderations for incident management\nWhatever incident management solution you choose, you need to ensure that it offers the ability to manage permissions at scale so you can control who accesses incident information and when they access it. Key features include:\nGroup permissions support for SSO, SAML, SCIM\n-\nThe ability to create and manage private incidents\n-\nRBAC across incident roles, services, teams, components and more\n-\nAbility to manage multiple organizations to ensure guardrails between organizations when needed\n-\nAttention to enterprise security concerns varies widely across vendors, so asking for specifics about these critical features is key.", "hash": "5f93769224aa78c5d8085fe4684a27071d2155fadffe3304a65c5725c5d78311", "id": "91289a24-6f61-437a-981a-70730fef40ef", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/05/17/incident-response-access-controls/", "osint_source_id": "c5bebd4b-5715-4589-a65c-0344a226ab6f", "published": "2024-05-17T09:30:12", "source": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/feed", "story_id": "7fc94a97-6d38-45d3-988a-f266571096cf", "title": "The importance of access controls in incident response"}], "tags": {"AuthN": {"name": "AuthN", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "AuthZ": {"name": "AuthZ", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Incident response": {"name": "Incident response", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "RBAC": {"name": "RBAC", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "SAML": {"name": "SAML", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "SCIM": {"name": "SCIM", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "SSO": {"name": "SSO", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "The importance of access controls in incident response"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T17:14:38.127764", "id": "ffca46cf-4077-43bb-b7cf-894644e15a67", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-17T09:15:54", "id": "b46789de-55c3-4a00-b7b3-22ccbcfa3031", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Neuartiges Gestein in Asteroiden-Probe entdeckt\nIm September 2023 hat die NASA-Raumsonde Osiris-Rex Gesteinsproben vom Asteroiden Bennu zur Erde gebracht.

It enables you to intentionally introduce faults and disruptions to test the resilience and robustness of your systems. By using Chaos Studio, you can uncover hard-to-find problems in your applications, from late-stage development through production, and plan mitigations to improve overall system reliability.\n \nThe provided GitHub Action workflows demonstrate a comprehensive approach to automating the deployment and management of an AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) cluster using Terraform, as well as deploying Chaos Mesh experiments and the Azure Vote service within the AKS cluster. These workflows streamline the infrastructure management process by integrating directly with GitHub, enabling seamless updates and deployments based on code changes or manual triggers. By leveraging GitHub Actions, Azure, and Kubernetes, these workflows ensure a robust, automated pipeline for maintaining and testing the resilience of applications deployed in the AKS environment.\n \nAutomating AKS with Terraform\n \nTo automate the deployment and management of an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, I utilized Terraform with the AKS module provided by Azure. This module simplifies the process by abstracting many of the complex configurations needed to set up and manage an AKS cluster.\n \nIn the Terraform configuration, I specified the AKS module with the latest version at the time, ensuring compatibility with the latest features and updates. The configuration began by defining essential parameters, such as the resource group name, Kubernetes version, and admin username. Automatic patch upgrades were enabled to ensure the cluster remains updated with the latest patches.\nThe cluster was configured to use virtual machine scale sets for agent nodes, with a specific node size and a range of nodes to accommodate varying workloads. Custom Linux OS configurations were applied to the agent nodes, enhancing their performance and security settings.\n \nTo enhance security, the API server was restricted to authorized IP ranges, including both public and private IP addresses of a bastion host and additional CIDR ranges. Integration with Azure Container Registry (ACR) was facilitated by attaching the ACR ID to the AKS cluster, enabling seamless container management.\n \nAdvanced features such as Azure Policy, auto-scaling, and HTTP application routing were enabled to improve cluster governance, scalability, and traffic management. User-assigned managed identities were employed for secure access control, and key management services (KMS) were enabled to secure sensitive data using Azure Key Vault.\n \nNetwork settings were carefully configured, including DNS service IP, service CIDR, network plugin, and policy settings, ensuring robust network management and security. Role-based access control (RBAC) was enabled and managed through Azure Active Directory (AAD) to streamline user and group management.\n \nAdditional features such as log analytics, maintenance windows, and secret rotation were configured to enhance cluster monitoring, maintenance, and security. Tags and labels were added to agent nodes for better organization and resource management.\nBy defining these configurations in Terraform, the AKS deployment process was automated, making it reproducible and manageable through code. This approach not only reduced manual intervention but also ensured consistency and reliability in the AKS infrastructure.\n \nNote: The code provided below is for exhibit purposes only and may be outdated at the time of writing. This code was used solely in a demo environment to illustrate the automation of an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster/Chaos Mesh using the AKS module in Terraform. While the configuration showcases a comprehensive setup, including security, scalability, and management features, it is essential to review and update the code according to the latest Azure and Terraform best practices and versions when implementing it in a production environment. The exhibit is intended to serve as an educational example and may require modifications to align with current standards and specific use cases.\n \n \nmodule \"aks\" {\n  source                                   = \"Azure/aks/azurerm\"\n  version                                  = \"7.4.0\"\n  \n  prefix                                   = random_id.aks.hex\n  resource_group_name                      = azurerm_resource_group.aks.name\n  kubernetes_version                       = \"1.27\" # don't specify the patch version!\n  admin_username                           = \"azureuser\"\n  automatic_channel_upgrade                = \"patch\"\n  agents_availability_zones                = [\"1\"]\n  agents_count                             = null\n  agents_max_count                         = var.agents_max_count\n  agents_max_pods                          = 75\n  agents_min_count                         = var.agents_min_count\n  agents_size                              = \"Standard_D2s_v3\"\n  agents_pool_name                         = \"testnodepool\"\n  agents_type                              = \"VirtualMachineScaleSets\"\n  agents_pool_linux_os_configs             = [\n    {\n      transparent_huge_page_enabled        = \"always\"\n      sysctl_configs                       = [\n        {\n          fs_aio_max_nr                    = 65536\n          fs_file_max                      = 100000\n          fs_inotify_max_user_watches      = 1000000\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n  api_server_authorized_ip_ranges          = concat([\"${azurerm_linux_virtual_machine.bastion.public_ip_address}/32\", \"${azurerm_linux_virtual_machine.bastion.private_ip_address}/32\", \"REDACTED\"],var.chaos_studio_cidr_ranges)\n  attached_acr_id_map                      = {\n    example                                = azurerm_container_registry.aks.id\n  }\n  azure_policy_enabled                     = true\n  auto_scaler_profile_enabled              = true\n  auto_scaler_profile_expander             = \"least-waste\"\n  enable_auto_scaling                      = true\n  http_application_routing_enabled         = true\n  identity_ids                             = [azurerm_user_assigned_identity.aks_mid.id]\n  identity_type                            = \"UserAssigned\"\n  ingress_application_gateway_enabled      = false\n  #ingress_application_gateway_id           = azurerm_application_gateway.aks_appgw.id\n  #ingress_application_gateway_subnet_cidr = \"10.52.1.0/24\"\n  key_vault_secrets_provider_enabled       = true\n  kms_enabled                              = true\n  kms_key_vault_key_id                     = \"https://${azurerm_key_vault.aks_kv.name}.vault.azure.net/keys/${azurerm_key_vault_key.aks_key.name}/${azurerm_key_vault_key.aks_key.version}\"\n  local_account_disabled                   = false\n  log_analytics_workspace_enabled          = true\n  cluster_log_analytics_workspace_name     = random_id.aks.hex\n  microsoft_defender_enabled               = false\n  maintenance_window                       = {\n    allowed                                = [\n      {\n        day                                = \"Sunday\",\n        hours                              = [22,23]\n      },\n    ]\n    not_allowed                            = [\n      {\n        start                              = \"2024-01-01T20:00:00Z\",\n        end                                = \"2024-01-01T21:00:00Z\"\n      },\n    ]\n  }\n  net_profile_dns_service_ip               = \"10.0.0.10\"\n  net_profile_service_cidr                 = \"10.0.0.0/16\"\n  network_plugin                           = \"azure\"\n  network_policy                           = \"azure\"\n  os_disk_size_gb                          = 60\n  private_cluster_enabled                  = false\n  public_network_access_enabled            = true\n  rbac_aad                                 = true\n  rbac_aad_managed                         = true\n  role_based_access_control_enabled        = true\n  secret_rotation_enabled                  = true\n  sku_tier                                 = \"Standard\"\n  storage_profile_blob_driver_enabled      = true\n  storage_profile_enabled                  = true\n  temporary_name_for_rotation              = \"a${random_string.aks_temporary_name_for_rotation.result}\"\n  vnet_subnet_id                           = azurerm_subnet.aks.id\n  rbac_aad_admin_group_object_ids          = [azuread_group.aks_admins.object_id]\n\n  agents_labels                            = {\n    \"Agent\"                                : \"agentLabel\"\n  }\n\n  agents_tags                              = {\n    \"Agent\"                                : \"agentTag\"\n  }\n  depends_on                               = [\n    azurerm_subnet.aks,\n  ]\n}\n \n \nAutomating AKS with GitHub Actions\n \nThe provided GitHub Action workflow automates the deployment of an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Terraform. This workflow is triggered on two conditions: when changes are pushed to the main branch within the terraform directory, or manually through a workflow dispatch event. The manual trigger allows users to specify the desired Terraform operation (plan, apply, or destroy) through an input parameter. This flexibility enables users to review changes, apply the infrastructure configuration, or tear it down as needed.\n \nThe workflow defines a single job named 'Terraform' that runs on the latest Ubuntu environment. It sets up necessary environment variables using secrets for secure authentication with Azure. The steps include checking out the repository, setting up the specified version of Terraform, and initializing Terraform with backend configuration sourced from environment variables. The workflow then validates the Terraform configuration to ensure correctness. Depending on the trigger, it proceeds to execute the appropriate Terraform command: plan to review the changes, apply to deploy the infrastructure, or destroy to remove it. This automation streamlines the management of the AKS cluster, ensuring consistent and reproducible deployments.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n    paths:\n      - 'terraform/**'\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      terraform_operation:\n        description: \"Terraform operation: plan, apply, destroy\"\n        required: true\n        default: \"plan\"\n        type: choice\n        options:\n          - plan\n          - apply\n          - destroy\n\nname: Deploy AKS Cluster\n\njobs:\n  terraform:\n    name: 'Terraform'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    env:\n      ARM_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.ARM_CLIENT_ID }}\n      ARM_CLIENT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.ARM_CLIENT_SECRET }}\n      ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: ${{ secrets.ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}\n      ARM_TENANT_ID: ${{ secrets.ARM_TENANT_ID }}\n      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}\n      TF_VERSION: 1.6.1\n\n    defaults:\n      run:\n        shell: bash\n        working-directory: ./terraform\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Setup Terraform\n        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3\n        with:\n          terraform_version: ${{ env.TF_VERSION }}\n\n      - name: Terraform Init\n        id: init\n        run: |\n          set -a \n          source ../.env.backend\n          terraform init \\\n            -backend-config=\"resource_group_name=$TF_VAR_state_resource_group_name\" \\\n            -backend-config=\"storage_account_name=$TF_VAR_state_storage_account_name\"\n\n      - name: Terraform Validate\n        id: validate\n        run: terraform validate -no-color\n\n      - name: Terraform Plan\n        id: plan\n        run: terraform plan -no-color\n        if: \"${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && github.event.inputs.terraform_operation == 'plan' || github.event_name == 'push' }}\"\n\n      - name: Terraform Apply\n        id: apply\n        run: terraform apply -auto-approve\n        if: \"${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' && github.event.inputs.terraform_operation == 'apply' }}\"\n\n      - name: Terraform Destroy\n        id: destroy\n        run: terraform destroy --auto-approve\n        if: \"${{ github.event.inputs.terraform_operation == 'destroy' }}\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAutomating Chaos Studio with Terraform\n\u00a0\nThe provided Terraform code defines resources for deploying Chaos Mesh. First, it creates a new Kubernetes namespace named \"chaos-testing\" using the kubernetes_namespace resource. This namespace isolates the Chaos Mesh components from other workloads in the cluster, enhancing organization and security by confining the chaos engineering experiments to a dedicated area.\n\u00a0\nNext, the code uses the helm_release resource to install Chaos Mesh via Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. The Helm chart for Chaos Mesh is specified from its official repository, with version 2.6 explicitly chosen. The installation occurs within the previously defined \"chaos-testing\" namespace. The set blocks within the helm_release resource customize the installation by configuring the chaosDaemon to use containerd as the runtime and specifying the socket path for the container runtime. This setup ensures that Chaos Mesh integrates correctly with the underlying container runtime, enabling effective chaos engineering experiments to test the resilience and robustness of applications running in the Kubernetes cluster.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nresource \"kubernetes_namespace\" \"chaos_testing\" {\n  metadata {\n    name     = \"chaos-testing\"\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"helm_release\" \"chaos_mesh\" {\n  name       = \"chaos-mesh\"\n  repository = \"https://charts.chaos-mesh.org\"\n  chart      = \"chaos-mesh\"\n  namespace  = kubernetes_namespace.chaos_testing.metadata[0].name \n  version    = \"2.6\"  # specify the version of the Chaos Mesh chart you want to deploy\n\n  set {\n    name     = \"chaosDaemon.runtime\"\n    value    = \"containerd\"\n  }\n\n  set {\n    name     = \"chaosDaemon.socketPath\"\n    value    = \"/run/containerd/containerd.sock\"\n  }\n}\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAutomating Chaos Studio with GitHub Actions\n\u00a0\nThe GitHub Action workflow provided facilitates the deployment and management of Chaos Mesh experiments and the Azure Vote service within an AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) cluster. This workflow can be triggered by three types of events: a push to the main branch, a published release, and a manual trigger via workflow_dispatch. The manual trigger allows users to choose between three operations: deploying the vote service, uninstalling the vote service, or deploying chaos experiments.\n\u00a0\nThe workflow defines three separate jobs corresponding to these operations, each running on a self-hosted runner. The deploy_vote_service job checks out the repository, logs into Azure using provided credentials, and sets up the Kubernetes configuration to interact with the AKS cluster. It then creates a namespace and deploys the Azure Vote service. The uninstall_vote_service job follows similar steps but focuses on removing the Azure Vote service from the cluster. The deploy_chaos_experiments job is more complex, involving the setup of the AKS configuration, deployment of chaos experiments, and management of necessary role assignments in Azure AD. It iterates over a set of predefined chaos experiment configurations, applies them, and ensures appropriate permissions are set for the experiments to interact with the AKS cluster.

This configuration, which is stored in a separate root GitHub folder named json, is utilized by the GitHub Action workflows to orchestrate chaos engineering experiments using Chaos Mesh. By keeping these JSON configurations organized in a dedicated folder, the workflows can easily reference and apply them during deployment, ensuring a structured and maintainable approach to chaos testing.\n\u00a0\nThe JSON file specifies the location of the experiment (eastus) and sets up a system-assigned identity for the resources. Within the properties section, the experiment steps are outlined, beginning with \"Step 1.\" This step includes a single branch (\"Branch 1\") that defines a continuous action targeting all pods within the \"azure-vote\" namespace. The action is configured to simulate pod failures for a duration of five minutes, utilizing a specific Chaos Mesh capability (podChaos/2.1). The JSON configuration also defines a selector (\"Selector1\") that identifies the specific AKS cluster targeted by the experiment. This setup ensures that the chaos experiment is precisely targeted and executed within the intended cluster, helping to test the resilience and fault tolerance of the applications running in the \"azure-vote\" namespace.\n\u00a0\nBy integrating these JSON configurations into the GitHub Action workflows, the automation process becomes seamless. The workflows dynamically replace placeholder values (SUBSCRIPTION_ID_PLACEHOLDER, RESOURCE_GROUP_PLACEHOLDER, and AKS_NAME_PLACEHOLDER) with actual values during execution. This dynamic replacement allows for flexibility and reusability of the JSON configurations across different environments and clusters. The structured approach of keeping these configurations in a dedicated folder and calling them within the GitHub Action workflows ensures a streamlined and efficient process for deploying and managing chaos experiments, ultimately contributing to the robustness and reliability of the AKS-deployed applications.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n{\n \"location\": \"eastus\",\n \"identity\": {\n   \"type\": \"SystemAssigned\"\n },\n \"properties\": {\n   \"steps\": [\n     {\n       \"name\": \"Step 1\",\n       \"branches\": [\n         {\n           \"name\": \"Branch 1\",\n           \"actions\": [\n             {\n               \"type\": \"continuous\",\n               \"selectorId\": \"Selector1\",\n               \"duration\": \"PT5M\",\n               \"parameters\": [\n                 {\n                     \"key\": \"jsonSpec\",\n                     \"value\": \"{\\\"action\\\":\\\"pod-failure\\\",\\\"mode\\\":\\\"all\\\",\\\"selector\\\":{\\\"namespaces\\\":[\\\"azure-vote\\\"]}}\"\n                 }\n               ],\n               \"name\": \"urn:csci:microsoft:azureKubernetesServiceChaosMesh:podChaos/2.1\"\n             }\n           ]\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n   ],\n   \"selectors\": [\n     {\n       \"id\": \"Selector1\",\n       \"type\": \"List\",\n       \"targets\": [\n         {\n           \"type\": \"ChaosTarget\",\n           \"id\": \"/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID_PLACEHOLDER/resourceGroups/RESOURCE_GROUP_PLACEHOLDER/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/AKS_NAME_PLACEHOLDER/providers/Microsoft.Chaos/targets/Microsoft-AzureKubernetesServiceChaosMesh\"\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n   ]\n }\n}\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSummary\n\u00a0\nWe covered several aspects of automating and managing AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) clusters and chaos engineering experiments using Terraform and GitHub Actions. We started by detailing the Terraform code used to deploy an AKS cluster, highlighting the configuration of various components such as agent nodes, network settings, security policies, and integrations with Azure services. This automation not only ensures a consistent deployment process but also leverages the power of infrastructure as code to manage complex cloud resources efficiently.\n\u00a0\nWe then explored a GitHub Action workflow designed to automate the deployment and management of Chaos Mesh experiments and the Azure Vote service. This workflow uses triggers based on code changes and manual inputs to execute specific tasks, such as deploying, uninstalling, or running chaos experiments within the AKS cluster. By integrating Azure credentials and Kubernetes configurations, the workflow streamlines the process of setting up and managing these experiments, ensuring that they are applied accurately and securely.\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, we delved into the JSON configurations used for chaos experiments, stored in a dedicated GitHub folder and referenced within the GitHub Action workflows. These configurations define detailed chaos experiment steps and selectors, targeting specific resources within the AKS cluster to simulate various fault scenarios. By organizing these configurations and automating their deployment, we enhance the resilience and fault tolerance of applications running in the cloud.\n\u00a0\nTogether, these discussions illustrate a robust approach to managing cloud infrastructure and testing application resilience through automation and chaos engineering. Utilizing Terraform for infrastructure deployment and GitHub Actions for orchestration and management allows for a streamlined, efficient, and consistent process, ultimately contributing to more reliable and resilient cloud-native applications.\n\u00a0\nHere are some helpful links from Microsoft Learn that relate to the topics we discussed today:\n\nCreate an AKS Cluster - Step-by-step guide to creating an AKS cluster using the Azure portal.\nTerraform on Azure Documentation - Comprehensive documentation on using Terraform with Azure, including examples and best practices.\nChaos Studio Overview - An introduction to Azure Chaos Studio, its features, and capabilities.\nDeploy Chaos Mesh on AKS - Tutorial on setting up and using Chaos Mesh within an AKS cluster through the Azure portal.\nGitHub Actions for Azure - Detailed guide on using GitHub Actions to automate workflows for Azure deployments.\nHelm for Kubernetes - Information on using Helm to manage Kubernetes applications on AKS.\nAzure Kubernetes Service Documentation - Comprehensive resource for all things AKS, including tutorials, reference architectures, and best practices.\nAzure Chaos Studio Tutorial - Instructions on creating chaos experiments using Chaos Studio and the Azure CLI.\n", "hash": "8058650922c194099515ab25c633e6e4055edca5061f2e15be48a6dc39052fbe", "id": "02d25842-ab45-4323-b720-3175001112fa", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/startups-at-microsoft/automate-aks-deployment-and-chaos-engineering-with-terraform-and/ba-p/4144238", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-17T09:03:40", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "6a34ff4c-f68d-4d53-a966-818bce858253", "title": "Automate AKS Deployment and Chaos Engineering with Terraform and GitHub Actions"}], "tags": {"10.0.0.0/16": {"name": "10.0.0.0/16", "tag_type": "ipv4_cidrs"}, "10.52.1.0/24": {"name": "10.52.1.0/24", "tag_type": "ipv4_cidrs"}, "ACR": {"name": "ACR", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "AKS": {"name": "AKS", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Azure": {"name": "Azure", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Azure Active Directory": {"name": "Azure Active Directory", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Azure Kubernetes Service": {"name": "Azure Kubernetes Service", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "CIDR": {"name": "CIDR", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "GitHub Actions": {"name": "GitHub Actions", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Kubernetes": {"name": "Kubernetes", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Microsoft Learn": {"name": "Microsoft Learn", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "RBAC": {"name": "RBAC", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Role-based": {"name": "Role-based", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Terraform": {"name": "Terraform", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Automate AKS Deployment and Chaos Engineering with Terraform and GitHub Actions"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T17:08:22.858867", "id": "a0b5a865-1191-431c-b47c-eeeb0bac82d0", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-17T17:10:57.631348", "id": "d781591a-e4b0-4645-bc57-9c9fba1c7929", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "9"}], "created": "2024-05-17T09:00:00", "id": "c339e397-3c00-44e6-b7c2-583a540ebb9e", "news_items": [{"author": "Aktuelles aus dem BM.I", "content": "Sport\nInnenministerium bereit, moldauischen Wintersportverband bei Initiativen zu unterst\u00fctzen\nAm 15.

Beim integrierten Thunderbird-Mail-Client deaktivieren die Entwickler jedoch lediglich den internen PDF-Reader, um diese Sicherheitsl\u00fccke zu stopfen \u2013 warum sie das Programm nicht ebenfalls auf Version 115.11 aktualisieren, bleibt unklar. PDF-Dateien lassen sich trotzdem durch den Document Viewer von Thunderbird aus anzeigen, erl\u00e4utert das Projekt in der Release-Ank\u00fcndigung zu Tails 6.3.\nWeitere \u00c4nderungen sind eher kosmetischer Natur. Am Ende eines automatischen Upgrades ist standardm\u00e4\u00dfig der \"Restart later\"-Button vorausgew\u00e4hlt, anstatt \"Restart now\". Bei der Konfiguration neuer Drucker konnte es Probleme geben, wenn bereits welche im persistenten Speicher von Tails 5.23 oder fr\u00fcher eingerichtet waren.

As industries navigate a landscape marked by rapid technological advances and significant labor shortages, AI and connected technologies emerge as critical tools for enhancing productivity and operational efficiency.\nThe Challenge of Skill Shortages in Manufacturing\nBrian outlines the challenges the manufacturing sector faces, which he describes as a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of rising customer demands, energy transitions, and inflationary pressures compounded by a severe shortage of skilled labor. This shortage spans various roles, from production to engineering and servicing, hindering companies\u2019 ability to maintain productivity and growth.\nLeveraging AI for Enhanced Productivity\nTo overcome these challenges, Brian underscores the pivotal role of digital technologies, particularly AI, in augmenting the workforce\u2019s capabilities. He showcases innovative applications at the fair, such as AI-enabled service tools that empower less experienced technicians to handle complex tasks. These tools, powered by generative AI, facilitate real-time, English-based interactions between technicians and the systems they service, providing step-by-step guidance that not only enhances job performance but also boosts customer satisfaction, reassuring the audience about the positive impact of AI on their work.\nThe Role of AI in Tackling Complex Services\nOne example Brian discusses is digitizing the service experience to allow technicians to interact intelligently with equipment through AI-driven chatbots. This technology speeds up new employees\u2019 learning curve and enables them to undertake more complex service tasks without frequent oversight. Such advancements are crucial for industries that struggle to find enough qualified workers to keep up with technological and market demands.\nScaling AI Innovations\nHowever, Brian points out that scaling these AI solutions is the real challenge. While many companies experiment with AI, transforming these experiments into comprehensive programs that reinvent processes and value chains is critical. He stresses the importance of focusing on substantial value creation, aligning workforce skills with new technologies, and ensuring responsible implementation.\nData Utilization and Platform Solutions\nA significant barrier to AI adoption is the underutilization of data. With billions of connected devices generating vast amounts of data, only a fraction is effectively employed. Brian suggests that the fragmented nature of data systems within industrial manufacturing can be addressed by platforms that contextualize data, allowing companies to extract value without the lengthy process of system unification.\nLeadership Mindset for Digital Transformation\nWrapping up the interview, Brian underscores the crucial role of leadership in propelling digital and AI transformations. Leaders should foster an environment that promotes experimentation and rapid adaptation while ensuring responsible technology use. By setting clear guidelines and supporting innovative endeavors, leaders can empower the audience to navigate the complexities of digital transformation in manufacturing.\nThe interview was recorded by Lucian Fogoros during the Hannover Messe 2024.

You could throw a lot of parts at the problem, but you don\u2019t necessarily have to. As [Shaun Crampton] demonstrates, you can run four brushless DC motors with a single Pi Pico.\n[Shaun] set about developing a brushless motor controller from scratch with the Pico, relying on its PIO hardware and the TI DRV8313 \u2014 a handy three phase motor driver. Before he knew it, he was implementing field oriented control (FOC) in MicroPython, only to find that it was a little too slow for proper motor control work. He soon switched to C for the lower overheads, and was readily driving a brushless motor with his own code. Before long, he\u2019d implemented torque limiting and PID speed control. He was even able to optimize things to the point where he had four motors hanging off a single Pi Pico, complete with Hall sensors for feedback.\nThe full story is well worth reading, as it goes from \u201cHello, World\u201d all the way to the end of the project. If you\u2019ve never experienced the joy of your own code getting a motor to spin, you might enjoy following in [Shaun\u2019s] footsteps.

Microsoft treibt ja die Sau \"k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz\" durchs Dorf und rollt in allen Produkten seinen CoPiloten aus. Gleichzeitig werden f\u00fcr diese L\u00f6sungen sowie das steigende Cloud-Gesch\u00e4ft massiv Rechenzentren in diversen L\u00e4ndern in die Botanik gestellt. Das bleibt nicht ohne Folgen: W\u00e4hrend Microsoft sich eine CO2-Neutralit\u00e4t bis 2030 auf die Fahnen geschrieben hat, sieht die Entwicklung aktuell eher d\u00fcster aus. Eine Untersuchung hat ergeben, dass die CO2-Emissionen zwischen 2020 und 2023 um 30 Prozent gestiegen sind (statt zu sinken).\nAnzeige\nHehres Ziel: CO2-Neutralit\u00e4t bis 2030\nMicrosoft gibt sich nach au\u00dfen ja gerne den Anstrich, eine saubere Firma zu sein, die sich auch um Umweltschutz und Klimawandel aktiv k\u00fcmmert. So will Microsoft bis 2030 eine CO2-Neutralit\u00e4t im Unternehmen erreichen und arbeitet seit Jahren an diesem Ziel (siehe auch). Das ist durchaus positiv zu sehen, und daran m\u00f6chte ich auch nicht r\u00fctteln.\nJahresberichte von Microsoft geben auch Auskunft dar\u00fcber, wie stark sich das Unternehmen auf dieses Ziel zubewegt. Microsoft investiert Milliarden in das Gesch\u00e4ft zum Auffangen von CO2 aus der Luft in Gestein. Dazu hat Redmond eine Vereinbarung mit dem Climate-Tech-Startup Heirloom Carbon getroffen. Die sollen \u00fcber die n\u00e4chsten Jahre hinweg 315.000 Tonnen Kohlenstoff in Gestein einlagern (siehe Beitrag Microsoft investiert in kohlenstoffabsorbierendes Gestein).\nAber es gibt die ber\u00fchmten Flops aus Redmond, wo das schnelle Gesch\u00e4ft \u00fcber alles geht und CO2-Neutralit\u00e4t nur st\u00f6rt. Ich hatte bereits 2023 im Blog-Beitrag Green Washing oder total bekloppt: Microsoft-Fails auf dem Weg zur CO2-Neutralit\u00e4t auf die Gaga-Ank\u00fcndigung, dass Windows Update \"co2-f\u00e4hig\" sei, hingewiesen. In diesem Beitrag hatte ich auf die Umweltfolgen des Umstiegs auf Windows 11 hingewiesen und auch geschrieben, dass Microsoft seine AI-L\u00f6sung CoPilot breit in Windows 11 und in Microsoft Office ausrollen und auch in Bing sowie anderer Software bereitstellen werde. Dort kam mein Hinweis, dass dies den Energieverbrauch sprunghaft in die H\u00f6he treiben werde. Das Puzzle-Teil f\u00e4llt genau in das nachfolgende Bild.\nMicrosofts CO2-Emissionen 30% gestiegen\nNun hat jemand mal genauer auf die CO2-Bilanz von Microsoft geschaut und verglichen, wie sich der Istzustand eigentlich zum geplanten Soll so entwickelt. Nachfolgender Mastodon-Post zeigt den Trend:\nDie Emissionen sollten im Vergleich zum Referenzjahr 2020 eigentlich st\u00e4ndig fallen (gr\u00fcne Punkte in der Grafik). Stattdessen ist eine Steigerung der CO2-Emissionen in den Jahren 2021, 2022 und 2023 zu verzeichnen (schwarze Punkt in der Grafik). F\u00fcr das Jahr 2023 ist der CO2-Aussto\u00df bei Microsoft (laut Microsofts Nachhaltigkeitsbericht 2024) um 30 % gegen\u00fcber der Referenzgr\u00f6\u00dfe 2020 gestiegen. Im Gesch\u00e4ftsjahr 2023 wurden 15.357 Millionen Tonnen Kohlendioxid ausgesto\u00dfen. Das entspricht der j\u00e4hrlichen CO2-Emission von Haiti oder Brunei.\nDer Grund wird auch genannt: Der weltweite Aufbau neuer Rechenzentren, in denen kohlenstoffintensiver Stahl, Zement und Chips ben\u00f6tigt werden. Die Rechenzentren werden gebraucht, um die durch Microsoft gepushte Nachfrage nach nach KI-L\u00f6sungen zu befriedigen. Das Trainieren und Ausf\u00fchren von KI-Modellen ist ein zunehmend energieaufw\u00e4ndiges Unterfangen, und die Auswirkungen auf das Klima werden gerade erst sichtbar.\nAnzeige\nDie Information wurde wohl durch ein Interview Pr\u00e4sident Brad Smith mit Bloomberg (Paywall) \u00f6ffentlich \u2013 Microsoft hat wohl den neuesten Nachhaltigkeitsbericht f\u00fcr 2023 vorgelegt. The Verge hat die Informationen hier aufbereitet. Die Botschaft aus den Artikeln: Microsofts KI-Vorsto\u00df gef\u00e4hrdet das Klimaziel des Unternehmens, da die aufzubauende Infrastruktur bereits jetzt f\u00fcr den 30%igen Anstieg der CO2-Emissionen verantwortlich ist.\nDie mach alles platt-Methode als Klimakiller\nIst f\u00fcr Microsoft aber alles kein Problem. Pr\u00e4sident Brad Smith ist der Meinung, dass der Nutzen der KI f\u00fcr die Welt die Auswirkungen auf die Umwelt \u00fcberwiegen wird. Um keine Missverst\u00e4ndnisse aufkommen zu lassen: Ich sehe den Einsatz von AI-L\u00f6sungen in ausgesuchten Bereich durchaus positiv. Aber Microsofts Ansatz war schon immer, mit halb fertig entwickelten Produkten auf den Markt zu kommen und alles platt zu machen. Genau dies passiert aber mit CoPilot, der ja in allen Produkten ausgerollt wird. Ob es Sinn macht, wird nicht hinterfragt. Und Administratoren werden in Zukunft ihre M\u00fche haben, zu kontrollieren, dass durch CoPilot keine Daten nach drau\u00dfen abflie\u00dfen d\u00fcrfen oder dass die Funktion \u00fcberhaupt aktiviert sein darf.

Herrn Putin einen Bescheid zur Co2-Abgabe f\u00fcr seine Kriege stellt? Und vor allem f\u00fcr den Umgang mit den \u00d6l- und Gas-Quellen und ganz besonders den W\u00e4ldern der riesigen Tundra \u00f6stlich des Ural \u2026\nZur Erinnerung: kurz vor Kriegsbeginn provozierte er mit der Frage, wie man denn in Deutschland ohne dem russischen Gas und Holz heizen wolle \u2026 Die W\u00e4lder werden in Russland seit Jahrhunderten ohne anschlie\u00dfende wieder Aufforstung Abgeholzt. Und was der Mensch nicht Abholzt, f\u00e4llt den sich h\u00e4ufenden j\u00e4hrlichen Waldbr\u00e4nden anheim. \u00dcbrig bleibt ein kahles Land, dessen Boden ohne B\u00e4ume ungesch\u00fctzt den Sonnenstrahlen direkt ausgesetzt ist. Aber auch in Alaska brodelt es im ehemals \"ewigen\" Eis (Permafrostb\u00f6den) immer mehr \u2026 der sog. \"Kipp-Punkt\" ist insofern l\u00e4ngst \u00fcberschritten. Die Permafrostb\u00f6den wird die Sommermonate \u00fcber NIEMAND mehr \"permanent\" Einfrieren k\u00f6nnen. Das Methan ist zudem bekanntlich hundertfach klimawirksamer als Co2.\nWo bleibt also die Methan-Emissions-Steuer der Gr\u00fcnen und sonstig politischen ***oten?\nMan braucht keine d\u00e4mliche KI um erkennen zu k\u00f6nnen, das dieser ganze Klimaschutz-Quark zwar gut gemeint ist, aber Jahrzehnte zu sp\u00e4t kommt und damit f\u00fcr'n Ar*** ist! Die junge Generation sollte sich darauf Vorbereiten, das das Spiel bereits AUS ist. Global +1,5\u00b0 (Pariser Klimaziel) haben wir bereits jetzt erreicht. Am Ende der Entwicklung werden es wohl doch eher +4\u00b0 und mehr sein \u2026 also ein zu weiten Teilen oder gar vollkommen f\u00fcr Homosapiens unbewohnbarer Planet! Es sei denn \"im Bunker\", also vielleicht permanent unterhalb der Erdoberfl\u00e4che zu leben? Man kennt ja solche Science-Fiction-Filme \u2026 Werden wir Menschen k\u00fcnftig also zu \"Kanalratten\"?\nL\u00f6sung? Tja, von einer wirtschaftlich rentablen L\u00f6sung, Co2 und Methan der Atmosph\u00e4re zu entnehmen und eben nicht \"einfach\" nur in den Boden zu verpressen, sondern daraus irgendwas sinnvolles zu machen, hat man bislang nichts geh\u00f6rt. Wenn so etwas noch k\u00e4me, best\u00fcnde vielleicht Hoffnung. Momentan greifen Politiker nicht mal bereits funktionierende L\u00f6sungsans\u00e4tze dieser Art auf. Ist das Bl\u00f6dheit? Oder wissen die einfach nix davon?\nOb durch Microsofts AI noch ein wenig mehr Co2 emittiert wird oder nicht, hat im Hinblick auf die Methanmengen, die bereits seit Jahren den Permafrostb\u00f6den entweichen (die weltweiten Erd-\u00d6l- und Erd-Gas-Bohrungen/F\u00f6rderungen nicht zu vergessen) , keine ernsthafte Relevanz. Also wor\u00fcber reden wir hier? Peanuts?\nDas Geschw\u00e4tz der Leerdenker und sonstigen Schwurbler, die immer wieder versuchen zu suggerieren, dass nur sie die Weisheit mit L\u00f6ffeln gefressen haben und alle anderen dumm wie Brot sind, ist doch immer wieder am\u00fcsant.\nAber zu suchen, hat dieser polemische Quatsch aus immer den gleichen Worth\u00fclsen in nem IT Blog meiner bescheiden Meinung nach eigentlich so gar nichts. G\u00fcnther Born, was sagen Sie dazu?\nNaja, auch wenn es Spa\u00df zu machen schein, immer auf Microsoft einzuschlagen, sei noch angemerkt, dass das kein Microsoft exklusives Problem ist. Auch wenn es das nat\u00fcrlich nicht besser macht, ist das bei anderen global Playern sicher nicht anders\u2026.

Mai zu installieren, mit dem Fehlercode 0x800f0982 zum Abbruch der Installation kommen. \"Das Problem tritt mit h\u00f6herer Wahrscheinlichkeit auf Ger\u00e4ten auf, die das englische Sprachpaket (English, United States) nicht installiert haben\", er\u00f6rtern die Entwickler.\nInstallationsfehler auch unter Windows 10\nEinige Kunden h\u00e4tten von Installationsfehlern f\u00fcr das Update KB5037765 unter Windows 10 Build 1809 berichtet. Heimanwender betr\u00e4fe das eher nicht, da die Home- und Pro-Versionen dieses Windows-Builds das Support-Ende bereits 2020 erreicht haben. Jedoch gibt es noch unterst\u00fctzte Enterprise- und LTSC-Versionen, die erweiterten Support genie\u00dfen.\nMicrosofts Entwickler arbeiten an einer L\u00f6sung, die sie so schnell wie m\u00f6glich ver\u00f6ffentlichen wollen, f\u00fchren sie den Fehlerbericht fort. Konkret betroffen sind demnach Windows 10 1809, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019 sowie Windows Server 1809 und Windows Server 2019.\nEine tempor\u00e4re Gegenma\u00dfnahme nennt Microsoft nicht. Da aber offenbar Systeme eher betroffen sind, wenn das Sprachpaket f\u00fcr Englisch (United States) fehlt, hilft m\u00f6glicherweise, dieses nachzuinstallieren und im Anschluss die Installation des Sicherheitsupdates erneut zu versuchen.\nIn der Nacht zum Mittwoch hat der regul\u00e4re Microsoft Patchday stattgefunden. Der Hersteller stellt dort geb\u00fcndelt Sicherheitskorrekturen f\u00fcr die zahlreichen Produkte und Angebote bereit. In Windows wurden bereits Sicherheitsl\u00fccken in freier Wildbahn angegriffen, um etwa QakBot-Drohnen zu verteilen. Daher ist das Installieren der Updates wichtig.\n(dmk)", "hash": "7945d8d9f861f370bcd59a7250fa20e8e7bc0f01f85f42e1670a31543f88eae5", "id": "57c0a526-a03d-4934-a693-c6627542ba72", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Microsoft-Installationsfehler-auf-Server-2019-der-Mai-Sicherheitsupdates-9722097.html?wt_mc=rss.red.security.security.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "c2c6d572-40f6-4271-ade8-596b8f44c6bb", "published": "2024-05-17T07:53:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/security/rss/news-atom.xml", "story_id": "ea0b5a64-f0fc-4b8d-b2a6-63b3275578ee", "title": "Windows Server 2019: Microsoft best\u00e4tigt Installationsfehler von Mai-Updates"}], "tags": {"0x800f0982": {"name": "0x800f0982", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "English": {"name": "English", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "KB5037765": {"name": "KB5037765", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "United States": {"name": "United States", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Windows 10": {"name": "Windows 10", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Windows Server 2019": {"name": "Windows Server 2019", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Windows Server 2019: Microsoft best\u00e4tigt Installationsfehler von Mai-Updates"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T09:14:22.173533", "id": "bf9dcc78-aa78-4863-ad94-2a36c4ac9cb9", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "3"}, {"created": "2024-05-17T09:19:08.855899", "id": "e924d62e-cecb-4a48-9b28-89734d9d41e4", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "8"}], "created": "2024-05-17T07:37:59", "id": "338e7ce4-af17-43fc-9426-5c72b158ea14", "news_items": [{"author": "ZDNet-Redaktion", "content": "Der Exploit zielt haupts\u00e4chlich auf Benutzer von Foxit Reader, der neben Adobe Acrobat Reader mit mehr als 700 Millionen Nutzern in mehr als 200 L\u00e4ndern einer der prominenten PDF-Viewer ist. Der Exploit l\u00f6st Sicherheitswarnungen aus, die ahnungslose Benutzer verleiten k\u00f6nnten, sch\u00e4dliche Befehle auszuf\u00fchren. CPR hat beobachtet, dass Varianten dieses Exploits aktiv in Umlauf sind.\nSchwachstellen im Design der Warnmeldungen\nDie Sicherheitsl\u00fccke nutzt das fehlerhafte Design der Warnmeldungen in Foxit Reader aus und sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass dem Nutzer standardm\u00e4\u00dfig die gef\u00e4hrlichsten Optionen angeboten werden. Sobald ein unvorsichtiger Benutzer zweimal mit der Standardoption fortf\u00e4hrt, wird der Exploit ausgel\u00f6st, der eine Nutzlast von einem Remote-Server herunterl\u00e4dt und ausf\u00fchrt.\nDieser Exploit wurde von mehreren Hackern f\u00fcr kriminelle Aktivit\u00e4ten und Spionage genutzt. CPR hat drei F\u00e4lle isoliert und eingehend untersucht, die von einer Spionage-Kampagne bis hin zu Cyber-Kriminalit\u00e4t mit mehreren Links und Tools reichen und beeindruckende Angriffsketten bilden. Eine der bekanntesten Kampagnen, die diese Schwachstelle ausnutzt, wurde m\u00f6glicherweise von der als APT-C-35 / DoNot Team bekannten Spionagegruppe durchgef\u00fchrt. Basierend auf der eingesetzten Malware, den an die Bots gesendeten Befehlen und den erhaltenen Opferdaten sind die T\u00e4ter in der Lage, hybride Kampagnen durchzuf\u00fchren, die auf Windows- und Android-Ger\u00e4te abzielen. Das f\u00fchrte teils zu einer Umgehung der Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung (2FA). Dieser Exploit wurde auch von verschiedenen Cyber-Kriminellen genutzt, welche die bekanntesten Malware-Familien verbreiten, wie VenomRAT, Agent-Tesla, Remcos, NjRAT, NanoCore RAT.\nPDFs f\u00fchrten PowerShell-Befehle zum Download sch\u00e4dlicher Nutzlasten aus\nBei einer anderen Kampagne identifizierte Check Point Research den Threat Actor als @silentkillertv, welcher eine Kampagne mit zwei verketteten PDF-Dateien durchf\u00fchrte, von denen eine auf einer legitimen Website, trello.com), gehostet wurde. Der Bedrohungsakteur verkauft auch b\u00f6sartige Tools und warb am 27. April f\u00fcr diesen Exploit. Bei den Recherchen stie\u00df CPR auf mehrere Builds, die der Akteur besitzt, um b\u00f6sartige PDF-Dateien zu erstellen, die diesen Exploit ausnutzen. Die meisten der gesammelten PDFs f\u00fchrten einen PowerShell-Befehl aus, der eine Nutzlast von einem Server herunterlud und dann ausgef\u00fchrt wurde, obwohl in einigen F\u00e4llen auch andere Befehle verwendet wurden.\nDieser Exploit k\u00f6nnte als eine Form von Phishing oder Manipulation eingestuft werden, die auf Foxit PDF Reader-Benutzer abzielt und sie verleitet, gewohnheitsm\u00e4\u00dfig auf \u201eOK\u201c zu klicken, ohne die damit verbundenen Risiken zu verstehen. Die Hacker reichen von rudiment\u00e4rer Cyber-Kriminalit\u00e4t bis hin zu APT-Gruppen. Das Untergrund-\u00d6kosystem nutzt diesen Exploit bereits seit Jahren aus. Bisher blieb er unentdeckt, da die meisten AV- und Sandboxen den Hauptanbieter von PDF-Readern, Adobe, zugrunde legen. Der Infektionserfolg und die niedrige Entdeckungsrate erm\u00f6glichen es, b\u00f6sartige PDFs \u00fcber viele unkonventionelle Wege, wie Facebook, zu verbreiten, ohne von Erkennungsregeln aufgehalten zu werden.

Der Downloader CloudEye ist erneut die Top-Malware in Deutschland. Er zielt auf die Windows-Plattform ab und wird benutzt, um sch\u00e4dliche Programme herunterzuladen und auf den Systemen der Opfer zu installieren. Am gesamten Malware-Aufkommen hatte CloudEye im April einen Anteil von 18,58 Prozent.\nMit einem gro\u00dfen Abstand landete Nanocore (Anteil 3,63 Prozent) auf dem zweiten Platz. Der Fernzugriffs-Trojaner wird ebenfalls gegen Windows-Systeme eingesetzt und bietet Funktionen wie Bildschirmaufnahmen, Fernsteuerung des Desktops und \u00dcbernahme von Webcam-Sitzungen.\nAbgerundet wird die Top 3 durch FakeUpdates alias SocGholish. Dieser in JavaScript geschriebene Downloader verbreitet unter anderem Schadprogramme wie GootLoader, Dridex, NetSupport, DoppelPaymer und AZORult.\nDie Statistik von Check Point gibt auch Einblick in die am h\u00e4ufigsten ausgenutzten Sicherheitsl\u00fccken. Dazu geh\u00f6ren die Anf\u00e4lligkeiten mit den Kennungen CVE-2021-43936 und CVE-2022-24086. Sie erlauben eine Command Injection per HTTP, die wiederum eine Remotecodeausf\u00fchrung ausl\u00f6sen kann. Auch die weiteren in der Statistik genannten Sicherheitsl\u00fccken sind gem\u00e4\u00df ihrer CVE-Nummern schon seit mehreren Jahren bekannt und gepatcht.\nBei den Ransomware-Gruppen war LockBit3 besonders aktiv \u2013 trotz der j\u00fcngsten Aktionen von Strafverfolgern. \u201eUnsere Untersuchungen haben gezeigt, dass die gemeinsamen internationalen Bem\u00fchungen gegen LockBit3 offenbar erfolgreich waren und den weltweiten Einfluss der Gruppe seit Anfang 2024 um mehr als f\u00fcnfzig Prozent reduziert haben\u201c, sagtet Maya Horowitz, VP of Research bei Check Point. \u201eUngeachtet der j\u00fcngsten positiven Entwicklungen m\u00fcssen Unternehmen ihrer Cybersicherheit weiterhin Priorit\u00e4t einr\u00e4umen, indem sie proaktiv handeln und die Netzwerk-, Endpunkt- und E-Mail-Sicherheit st\u00e4rken. Die Implementierung von mehrschichtigen Schutzma\u00dfnahmen und die Einf\u00fchrung von robusten Backup- und Wiederherstellungsprozeduren sowie von Pl\u00e4nen zur Reaktion auf Vorf\u00e4lle sind nach wie vor der Schl\u00fcssel zur Steigerung der Cyber-Resilienz.\u201c\nDar\u00fcber hinaus stellten die Forscher eine deutliche Zunahme von Androxgh0st-Angriffen fest. Die Malware wird als Werkzeug f\u00fcr den Diebstahl sensibler Informationen \u00fcber Botnets eingesetzt. Unter Ausnutzung von Schwachstellen wie CVE-2021-3129 und CVE-2024-1709 setzen die Angreifer Web-Shells zur Fernsteuerung ein und konzentrieren sich auf den Aufbau von Botnetzen zum Diebstahl von Anmeldeinformationen. Dies wurde in einem gemeinsamen Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) des FBI und der CISA festgestellt. Androxgh0st-Akteure haben eine Vorliebe f\u00fcr die Ausnutzung von Schwachstellen in Laravel-Anwendungen gezeigt, um Anmeldedaten f\u00fcr Cloud-basierte Dienste wie AWS, SendGrid und Twilio zu erbeuten.

Das geht aus einer aktuellen Umfrage des Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverbands (vzbv) hervor. Diese zeigt, wie schwierig es f\u00fcr viele ist, betr\u00fcgerische von echten Bankabfragen zu unterscheiden.\nAnfang November 2023 f\u00fchrte der vzbv dazu eine f\u00fcr Internetnutzer repr\u00e4sentative Online-Befragung mit 1035 Teilnehmenden durch. Diese wurden mit vier verschiedenen Szenarien aus dem digitalen Zahlungsverkehr konfrontiert \u2013 zwei waren authentisch, zwei betr\u00fcgerisch. Die Befragten sollten einsch\u00e4tzen, ob es sich um Betrug handelt und wie sie darauf reagieren w\u00fcrden.

Interessanterweise hielten 19 Prozent der Befragten auch die echten Anfragen von Banken f\u00fcr einen Betrugsverdacht, was laut vzbv die hohe Verunsicherung verdeutliche.\nEin weiteres Ergebnis der Umfrage zeigt, dass Warnmeldungen von Banken ihren Zweck oft nicht erf\u00fcllen. Nur 16 Prozent der Befragten, die auf einen Betrug hereingefallen w\u00e4ren, erkannten den Betrug, nachdem sie eine Warnmeldung erhalten hatten. Viele Verbraucher sahen in den Warnmeldungen sogar eine Best\u00e4tigung ihres korrekten Verhaltens und wogen sich in falscher Sicherheit. Sie empfanden die Abl\u00e4ufe als \"unverst\u00e4ndlich, kompliziert oder verwirrend\". Diese Unklarheiten tragen dazu bei, dass auch legitime Anfragen oft als verd\u00e4chtig eingestuft werden.\nBetrugsopfer w\u00fcrden Konsequenzen f\u00fcr digitalen Zahlungsverkehr ziehen\nDie Umfrage zeigt auch die m\u00f6glichen Folgen f\u00fcr die Betrugsopfer. 43 Prozent derjenigen, die auf einen Betrug hereingefallen w\u00e4ren, gaben an, ihr digitales Leben in Zukunft stark einschr\u00e4nken zu wollen. 19 Prozent w\u00fcrden kein Online-Banking mehr nutzen und 13 Prozent auf Online-Zahlungen verzichten.\nDie vollst\u00e4ndige Studie des vzbv (PDF) bietet detaillierte Einblicke in die verschiedenen Szenarien und die Reaktionen der Befragten und kann als Grundlage f\u00fcr zuk\u00fcnftige Ma\u00dfnahmen zur Verbesserung der Sicherheit im digitalen Zahlungsverkehr dienen.\nPhishing-Versuche bei Netflix, Sparkassen und Co.\nErst k\u00fcrzlich erhielt die Verbraucherzentrale zahlreiche Mails \u00fcber Phishing-Versuche bei Netflix-Kunden.

The nation-state actor attack used a fake account posing as a South Korean public official in the North Korean human rights sector. The APT group aimed at connecting with key individuals in North Korean and security-related fields through friend requests and direct messages.\nThe attack chain starts with the theft of the identity of a real person in South Korea, then the victims were contacted via Facebook Messenger.\nThreat actors pretended to share private documents they had written with the victims.\n\u201cThe initial individual approach is similar to an email-based spear phishing attack strategy. However, the fact that mutual communication and reliability were promoted through Facebook Messenger shows that the boldness of Kimsuky APT attacks is increasing day by day.\u201d reads the report published by GSC. \u201cThe Facebook screen used in the actual attack has a background photo that appears to have been taken at a public institution. Threat actors disguised as public officials try to win the favor of their targets by pretending to share private documents they have written.\u201d\nThe messages included a link to a decoy document hosted on OneDrive. The file is a Microsoft Common Console document that masquerades as an essay or content related to a trilateral summit between Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. One of the decoy documents (\u2018NZZ_Interview_Kohei Yamamoto.msc\u2019) employed in the attacks was uploaded to the VirusTotal from Japan on April 5, 2024.\nThe malware had zero detection rate on VT at the upload time.\nThe experts speculate the APT group was targeting people in Japan and South Korea.\n\u201cThis is the first time that a suspected attack against Japan was first observed, and then a variant was detected in Korea shortly after.\u201d reads the analysis. \u201cAnd if you compare the two malicious file execution screens, you can see the same pattern. Although the file name leading to execution is different, both used the name \u2018Security Mode\u2019.\u201d\nUpon launching the MSC file and allowing it to open it using Microsoft Management Console (MMC), victims are displayed a console screen containing a Word document. If the victims launch it the multi-stage attack chain starts.\nThe malicious file, named \u201cConsole Root task window \u2018Security Mode\u2019,\u201d hid certain window styles and tabs. It misled users by labeling a task as \u201cOpen\u201d with a description \u201cMy_Essay.docx,\u201d making it appear as a document execution screen. Clicking \u201cOpen\u201d triggers a malicious command. This command line involves \u2018cmd.exe\u2019 with various parameters and attempts to connect to the C2 host \u2018brandwizer.co[.]in,\u2019 registered by Whiteserver hosting in India and linked to the IP address \u20185.9.123.217\u2019 in Germany.\nThe malware maintains persistence by registering a scheduled task named \u2018OneDriveUpdate,\u2019 which repeats every 41 minutes indefinitely. This interval is consistent with the timing used in previous Kimsuky group campaigns, such as \u2018BabyShark\u2018 and \u2018ReconShark.\u2019\nThe malware gathered information and exfiltrated it to the C2 server, it can also harvest IP addresses, User-Agent strings, and timestamp information from the HTTP requests. The malware can also drop additional payloads on the infected machines.\n\u201cAmong the APT attacks reported in Korea in the first quarter of this year, the most representative method is spear phishing attack. In addition, the method of combining shortcut (LNK) type malicious files is steadily becoming popular. Although not commonly reported, covert attacks through social media also occur.\u201d concludes the report.\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n(SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, Kimsuky)", "hash": "1809969ee546f27fa8651c813dd698258ceee5084a4b518260e53d7b9f49cd72", "id": "af68e48b-1d72-47c9-8f48-084e0d130ed8", "link": "https://securityaffairs.com/163265/apt/north-korea-kimsuky-apt-uses-messenger.html", "osint_source_id": "d01d5487-bebf-40c5-a433-cdbe4670e633", "published": "2024-05-17T07:10:21", "source": "http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/feed", "story_id": "bf03be5d-43cc-4cd4-b276-031bd1188d9a", "title": "North Korea-linked Kimsuky APT attack targets victims via Messenger"}], "tags": {"BabyShark": {"name": "BabyShark", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "GSC": {"name": "GSC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Genius Security Center": {"name": "Genius Security Center", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Germany": {"name": "Germany", "tag_type": "Country"}, "HTTP": {"name": "HTTP", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "India": {"name": "India", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Interview": {"name": "Interview", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Japan": {"name": "Japan", "tag_type": "Country"}, "KISA": {"name": "KISA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Kimsuky": {"name": "Kimsuky", "tag_type": "APT"}, "Korea": {"name": "Korea", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "MMC": {"name": "MMC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "MSC": {"name": "MSC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Mastodon": {"name": "Mastodon", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Microsoft Common Console": {"name": "Microsoft Common Console", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "NZZ": {"name": "NZZ", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "North Korea": {"name": "North Korea", "tag_type": "Country"}, "North Korea-linked": {"name": "North Korea-linked", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "North Korean": {"name": "North Korean", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Open": {"name": "Open", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ReconShark.\u2019": {"name": "ReconShark.\u2019", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "South Korea": {"name": "South Korea", "tag_type": "Country"}, "South Korean": {"name": "South Korean", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "U.S.": {"name": "U.S.", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "User-Agent": {"name": "User-Agent", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "VirusTotal": {"name": "VirusTotal", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "phishing": {"name": "phishing", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "North Korea-linked Kimsuky APT attack targets victims via Messenger"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T09:15:24.835131", "id": "9a42d47c-58e9-46b3-942e-a5b1a5ea8156", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "8"}], "created": "2024-05-17T07:00:36", "id": "1fe412dc-f201-4276-83fe-8869ea04ad84", "news_items": [{"author": "Industry News", "content": "GitLab unveils AI capabilities to help organizations better secure their software\nGitLab announced new innovations across the platform to streamline how organizations build, test, secure, and deploy software.\nIntroducing GitLab Duo Enterprise\nGitLab Duo Enterprise, a new end-to-end AI add-on, combines the developer-focused AI capabilities of GitLab Duo Pro\u2014organizational privacy controls, code suggestions, and chat\u2014with enterprise-focused AI capabilities to help organizations proactively detect and fix security vulnerabilities, summarize issue discussions and merge requests, resolve CI/CD bottlenecks and failures, and enhance team collaboration.\nA new AI impact dashboard and value stream forecasting capability will give an organization insight into its usage of AI features and their effect on software development lifecycle metrics such as cycle time and deployment frequency.\nOrganizations can customize GitLab Duo with context from their software projects for model personalization.

Kann das jemand best\u00e4tigen.\nAnzeige\n\u00c4hnliche Artikel:\nOffice Updates vom 7. Mai 2024\nMicrosoft Security Update Summary (14. Mai 2024)\nPatchday: Windows 10/Server-Updates (14. Mai 2024)\nPatchday: Windows 11/Server 2022-Updates (14. Mai 2024)\nWindows Server 2012 / R2 und Windows 7 (14. Mai 2024)\nMicrosoft Office Updates (14. Mai 2024)\nWindows Server 2019: Update KB5037765 scheitert mit Error 0x800f0982\nCookies blockieren entzieht uns die Finanzierung: Cookie-Einstellungen\nAuf einem Testserver probiert, zumindest lief die Installation nun durch und es steht \"Neustart\" ausstehend. Und kein Installationsfehler, allerdings au\u00dferhalb von WSUS, direkt \u00fcber Windows Update\nJa, kann ich best\u00e4tigen. Revision ist 201 (original 200) und es wird als nicht erforderlich gegkennzeichnet (Ansicht: \"nicht genehmigt\" und Status \"Alle\").\nBisher kann ich weder das eine noch das andere best\u00e4tigen.\nKein automatisch installiertes Sprachpaket (d\u00fcrfen die das) noch ein revidiertes KB5037765 \u00fcber Windows Update. Zumindest wird das fehlerhafte KB5037765 nicht mehr angeboten.\nIch denke das liegt jetzt am Rolloutprozess. Mal sehen was der Tag bringt.\nEvtl. manuell \u00fcber den UpdateCatalog.\nHallo,\nauf einem deutschen WSUS Server 2019 (ohne installiertes englisches Sprachpaket) wurde bis gestern das Update KB5037765 zur Installation f\u00fcr unsere 2019 Server angeboten. Freigegeben hatte ich dies vorerst nicht. Seit heute morgen ben\u00f6tigt angeblich kein Server 2019 mehr dieses Updates. Das Eingangsdatum des Updates steht auf \"17.05.2024 01:26\". Das passt auch zur WSUS Synchronisation.\nIch habe mir dann den Update Verlauf auf einem Server 2019 angeschaut. Dort ist das Update auch nicht installiert \u2013 h\u00e4tte mich auf gewundert, da ich es ja nicht freigegeben habe.\nDie Frage ist jetzt, warum auf einmal kein 2019 Server mehr angeblich dieses Update ben\u00f6tigt?\nHat jemand \u00e4hnliche Erfahrungen?\nGru\u00df\nOliver\nHi,\nbei uns das gleiche, deutsche 2019 Server ohne engl. Sprachpaket. WSUS Server auch deutsch 2019.\nDas neue KB5037765 vom 17.05. wird nun f\u00fcr alle unsere 2019er als nicht relevant im WSUS angezeigt. Keiner der 2019er fordert das Paket vom WSUS an.\nKann ich auf einem deutschen 2019 Testserver best\u00e4tigen, bei dem das Update bisher fehlgeschlagen war. Bei allen anderen Servern, die die Genehmigung vom WSUS noch nicht erhalten haben, wird das Update weiterhin als \"Erforderlich\" angezeigt.\nEdit: anscheinend f\u00e4llt das Update jetzt nach und nach auch bei den anderen Servern als \"Erforderlich\" raus.\nJa, ist pl\u00f6tzlich nicht mehr im WSUS. Meine Server 2019 haben das Englische Sprachpaket. Seuzf.\nMhm, die 2019 Server die gepatcht werden sollen zeigen bei dem Update jetzt keine Berechtigung f\u00fcr den angemeldeten User zur Installation an ( die, bei denen das Commulative Update noch angezeigt wird). Das .net Update wird installiert. Nach neustart kein Mai Update mehr (auch nicht nach erneuter Suche). Auf einem Terminalserver \u2013 auch 2019 bietet Windows Update das besagte KB gar nicht mehr an. Alle Server englisch\u2026. Kein Wsus im Einsatz.\nAuf meinem Testserver wurden nur noch die Updates KB890830 und KB5038283 angeboten (ohne WSUS), aber nicht mehr das Update KB5047765. Bei einem zweiten Server stand das KB5047765 zwar noch unter verf\u00fcgbaren Updates konnte aber nicht mehr abgerufen werden, \"Status: Einige Updates konnten mithilfe Ihres Anmeldekontos nicht installiert werden. Versuchen Sie, sich mit einem anderen Konto anzumelden.\" Nach dem Reboot der Server und einer erneuten Suche tauchten keine fehlendes Update mehr auf. Alle Server deutsch.\nIch kann das verhalten best\u00e4tigen alle Server 2019 (nur DE Sprachpaket) zeigen das Update nun als nicht ben\u00f6tigt an. Aktuell ben\u00f6tigen alle Server 2019 nur das Kumulative .NET Framework Update.\nDer Installationsfehler ist damit vorerst gestoppt, die Server sind dadurch aber aktuell noch nicht gegen die beseitigten Sicherheitsl\u00fccken gesch\u00fctzt.\nAktuell kann ich nur hoffen das Microsoft das jetzt schnell gel\u00f6st bekommt. Bei der Anzahl an Systemen die ich betreue steht eine h\u00e4ndische L\u00f6sung zeitlich au\u00dfer Frage.\nKann ich ebenfalls best\u00e4tigen. Die Revision ist 201 und das Update wird bei gut 2/3 unserer Server als nicht erforderlich gegkennzeichnet.\nMein WSUS hat sich heut morgen synchronisiert und zeigt mir jetzt neu die Revision 201 an (\u00dcberarbeitet 14.05.2024, genaue wie Revision 200). F\u00fcr meine 2019 Server Deutsch (ohne englisches Sprachpaket) zeigt mir mein WSUS es aktuell aber als erforderlich an.\nEdit: Nachdem die Server inzwischen nach neuen Updates beim WSUS gesucht haben und einen aktuellen Report geschickt haben, ist das Update jetzt auch nicht mehr erforderlich.\nVermutlich hat MS nur die Detektion des Pakets in Revision 201 ge\u00e4ndert und es wird nur noch f\u00fcr englischsprachige Server angeboten.\nInfos zur Revision 201:\n\"Die Anwendbarkeitsregeln oder Voraussetzungen haben sich ge\u00e4ndert. Diese \u00c4nderung bedeutet, dass die neue Revision m\u00f6glicherweise auf anderen Computern angeboten wird als die alte Revision.\"\nHier ebenfalls. KB5037765 wurde erst als \"Nicht Installiert\" angezeigt und jetzt als \"nicht zufreffend\" (deutsche Installationen). Es ist ein Trauerspiel.\nAuch bei mir wird das \"\u00fcberarbeitete\" Update im WSUS f\u00fcr die 2019er als nicht ben\u00f6tigt angezeigt, und das Update vom 16.05.2024 aus dem Update Katalog schl\u00e4gt genauso fehl. Das nenne ich mal konsequent Sch\u2026. bauen\u2026\nIch habe den Workarroud mit dem Sprachpaket in einer Arztpraxis (x.isynet) angewendet. Der Neustart dauerte drei Stunden, bis der Server 2019 wieder per RDP errecihtbar war.\nJetzt steht zwar, \"Sie sind auf dem neuesten Stand\".\nDas ganze System ist aber praktisch unbenutzbar.\nAlle Drucker sind vergessen.\nOffice 2007 funktioniert nicht mehr.\nFritzfax \u00fcber Fritzbox funktioniert nicht mehr.\nAuch das Verordnungsmodul bleibt h\u00e4ngen. Also keine eRezepte, keine Rezepte, keine \u00dcberweisungen, keine Arztbriefe, keine Faxe. Eine absolute Katastrophe.\nNur das Kernmodul scheint noch zu funktionieren. Da hier produktiv gearbeitet werden muss, kommt auch ein R\u00fcckspielen des Backups jetzt nicht in Frage, sondern ist erst am Wochenende m\u00f6glich.\nVielen Dank Microsoft\nOffice 2007? Auf einem produktiv genutzten Arzt Server?\nDa ist es ja gut, dass nun nichts mehr durch dieses Update funktioniert.\nSofort weg mit Office 2007 \u2013 das ist ein Sicherheits-GAU\nServus..\ndas packet ist bei mir jetzt komplett raus.. sowohl auf deutschen als auch auf englischen Servern (beides im Einsatz) ist es nicht mehr erforderlich\u2026\nIch denke.. warten auf das update von Update.. oder auf 2022 migrieren ;-)\nund ich habe mich schon gewundert\u2026 \u00dcber WSUS wird es nicht als erforderlich erkannt, direkt bei MicrosoftUpdate aber schon.\nich verwende gerne das Paket PSWindowsUpdate und dort wird es angezeigt, wenn die Option -Microsoftupdate angegeben ist.\nAnsonsten hatte ich versucht das Sprachpaket En-Us \u00fcber die Einstellungen zu aktivieren.

This generally doesn\u2019t allow for much design of the clock besides the face, and since [core weaver] was building a clock that plays bird songs, a much more hackable clock driver was needed to interface with the rest of the electronics needed to build this project.\nThe clock hands for this build are driven by a double stepper motor which controls an hour and minute hand coaxially but independently. Originally an H-bridge circuit was designed for driving each of the hands but they draw so little current in this configuration that they could be driven by the microcontroller directly. A DS3231 clock is used for timekeeping connected to an ATMega128a which controls everything else. At the start of each hour the clock plays a corresponding bird song by communicating with an mp3 module, and a remote control can also be used to play the songs on demand.\nBird clocks are not an uncommon thing to find off the shelf, but this one adds a number of customizations that let it fly above those offerings, including customizing the sounds that play on the hour and adding remote control capabilities, a lithium battery charging circuit, and a number of other creature comforts. If you\u2019re looking for even more unique bird clock designs this binary bird clock might fit the bill.\n3 thoughts on \u201cCustomizable Bird Clock Sings The Hours By\u201d\nFunny project. I bought one of these Chinese clocks a couple of weeks back for around 5\u20ac. The right birdsound is played by a starting the clock just before 6 am and every time the minute hand reaches 0 there is a switch which gets triggered. The module counts the switch moments to know if it\u2019s am or pm when you adjust the clock to the proper time, to allow for the silent period between 9:00 pm and 06:00 am. An easy mod would be to keep everything of the clock and attach your own sound module. This would certainly improve on the lo-fi bird sounds that the stand module plays, but you could also play farts on random hour times etc.\nNice, ending the title with a preposition.\nThe \u201cAudubon\u201d-branded clocks like that stop playing the bird sounds after 18 months.\nThe appropriate bird song is played if you push a button on the back, but it doesn\u2019t happen automatically.\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Das habe 6,8 Millionen US-Dollar eingebracht.\nDas US-Justizministerium hat Christina Marie C. aus Arizona eines Betrugssystems angeklagt, bei dem sie nordkoreanischen IT-Mitarbeitern zu Homeoffice-Jobs bei US-amerikanischen Unternehmen verholfen hat. Daf\u00fcr habe sie Identit\u00e4tsdiebstahl, Urkundenf\u00e4lschung und eine Laptop-Farm eingesetzt, um den Aufenthalt der Mitarbeiter in den USA vorzut\u00e4uschen.\nDas habe Nordkorea bei dessen Finanzierung seiner Waffenprogramme unterst\u00fctzt. Denn die 49-j\u00e4hrige C. habe mit ihrem Betrugssystem mindestens 6,8 Millionen US-Dollar eingenommen, das sie an Nordkoreas Abteilung f\u00fcr Munitionsindustrie weitergeleitet habe. Diese ist in wichtige Aspekte der Waffenprogramme des Landes involviert, einschlie\u00dflich der Raketenentwicklung, schreibt die Anklage.\nTeil des Betruges war die Kompromittierung von mehr als 60 in den USA lebenden Personen, deren pers\u00f6nliche Informationen dazu genutzt wurden, um den Nordkoreanern die IT-Stellen in \u00fcber 300 Firmen zu verschaffen. Bei den Unternehmen handelt es sich laut Anklage etwa um eines der f\u00fcnf gro\u00dfen Fernsehnetzwerke, eine hochrangige Technologiefirma im Silicon Valley, einen Flugzeug- und R\u00fcstungshersteller, einen ber\u00fchmten amerikanischen Automobilhersteller, eine High-End-Einzelhandelskette und eines der bekanntesten Medien- und Unterhaltungsunternehmen der Welt, alles Fortune-500-Unternehmen.\nLaptop-Farm als angebliches Homeoffice\nZudem habe C. an einem ihrer Wohnorte eine Laptop-Farm betrieben, um den Arbeitgebern den Aufenthalt der Mitarbeiter innerhalb der USA vorzut\u00e4uschen.

Im M\u00e4rz 2020 sei Chapman auf dem Business-Netzwerk LinkedIn kontaktiert und eingeladen worden, das \"US-Gesicht\" der Firma zu werden.

And the situation is not expected to get any better.\nAI skills are currently most in-demand\nIDC predicts that by 2026, more than 90% of organizations worldwide will feel the pain of the IT skills crisis, amounting to some $5.5 trillion in losses caused by product delays, impaired competitiveness, and loss of business.\nWhile it\u2019s no surprise that AI skills are currently the most in-demand skill for most enterprises, IT Operations are a close second. And a variety of cloud skills, including architecture, data management and storage, and software development, are among the ten most needed skills identified by survey respondents. This situation is further compounded by the need for additional, non-technical skills, such as digital business skills, human skills, and leadership skills.\n\u201cGetting the right people with the right skills into the right roles has never been so difficult,\u201d says Gina Smith, PhD, research director for IDC\u2019s IT Skills for Digital Business practice. \u201cAs IT skills shortages widen and the arrival of new technology accelerates, enterprises must find creative ways to hire, train, upskill, and reskill their employees. A culture of learning is the single best way to get there.\u201d\nOrganizations encounter resistance in skill development initiatives\nAmong the challenges organizations face when trying to expand the skills of their employees is resistance to training. Employees complain that the courses are too long, the options for learning are too limited, and there isn\u2019t enough alignment between skills and career goals.\nTo overcome these challenges, IT leaders need to employ a variety of strategies to encourage a more effective learning environment within their organization. This includes everything from classroom training to hackathons, hand\u2019s on labs, and games, quests, and mini-badges.\n70% of survey respondents indicated that they are already utilizing experiential learning methods, which includes labs, games, and hackathons. And GenAI has also found its way into the current training environment, with more than half the organizations surveyed using or piloting it for IT training.\nBut fostering a positive learning environment in an organization requires more than just materials, courses, and challenges. Culture change begins at the top and leaders need to demonstrate why learning matters to the organization. This can be done by aligning employee goals with business goals, promoting continuous learning throughout the employee\u2019s journey, and creating a rewards program that recognizes process as well as performance. It also requires the allocation of adequate time, money, and people resources.\nFill out the form to get your guide:", "hash": "84754e12db58fb1f4da745f9fb2d16a0ea7bb67d03ddf4acbe74b67838bed5d3", "id": "19278bd0-a893-46a1-bb9f-3353a495f7f9", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/05/17/it-skills-shortage-in-organizations/", "osint_source_id": "c5bebd4b-5715-4589-a65c-0344a226ab6f", "published": "2024-05-17T04:30:22", "source": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/feed", "story_id": "0eb9dff4-8a8f-4650-8ff6-5dbb8811acb8", "title": "The IT skills shortage situation is not expected to get any better"}], "tags": {"Gina Smith": {"name": "Gina Smith", "tag_type": "PER"}, "IDC": {"name": "IDC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "North American": {"name": "North American", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "PhD": {"name": "PhD", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "The IT skills shortage situation is not expected to get any better"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-17T09:10:40.271845", "id": "1ad8651e-607e-4338-b412-7fc0f06a2043", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}, {"created": "2024-05-17T09:17:25.844812", "id": "8eb58111-4ac1-4a21-a083-34ed637da277", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "4"}], "created": "2024-05-17T04:00:48", "id": "4a075508-18bf-40d7-82e9-188be0b41250", "news_items": [{"author": "Help Net Security", "content": "Organizations struggle to defend against ransomware\nIn this Help Net Security video, Jeremy Nichols, Director, Global Threat Intelligence Center at NTT Security Holdings, discusses a recent surge in ransomware incidents.\nAfter a down year in 2022, ransomware and extortion incidents increased in 2023.

Ausgebildete Gesundheits- und Krankenpflegepersonen, die Menschen daheim besuchen und beraten, k\u00f6nnen einen entscheidenden Beitrag leisten, um Erkrankungen zu vermeiden und ein selbstbestimmtes Leben im eigenen Zuhause zu erm\u00f6glichen. \u00d6sterreich sammelt gerade erste Erfahrungen damit. Seit 2022 gibt es ein von der EU finanziertes Pilotprojekt. Die FH Campus Wien hat in einem Forschungsprojekt die Effekte untersucht, die Community Nurses in mehreren Regionen des Landes erzielen konnten.\nVorbeugung ist effizienter und g\u00fcnstiger\nBeauftragt wurde die FH Campus Wien vom Evangelischen Diakoniewerk Gallneukirchen, dem gr\u00f6\u00dften Anbieter von Community Nursing in \u00d6sterreich. \"Community Nurses sollen in Europa k\u00fcnftig die Prim\u00e4rversorgung unterst\u00fctzen\", sagt Projektleiterin Cornelia Feichtinger, Leiterin des Zentrums f\u00fcr Angewandte Pflegeforschung. \"Vorbeugung ist effizienter und g\u00fcnstiger als das, was wir in \u00d6sterreich derzeit haben, ein kuratives System.\"\nAlleine in \u00d6sterreich gibt es durch das EU-Pilotprojekt 116 Regionen, in denen Community Nursing nun angeboten wird. Die wichtigsten Akteur*innen dabei sind Gesundheits- und Krankenpfleger*innen, die mindestens 2 Jahre Berufserfahrung mitbringen m\u00fcssen. \"Die meisten haben viel mehr Praxiserfahrung, greifen auf Praxis aus 5 Jahren bis hin zu mehreren Jahrzehnten zur\u00fcck\", sagt Feichtinger. Zur Fachkompetenz z\u00e4hlen f\u00fcr Community Nurses auch pers\u00f6nliche Skills wie gro\u00dfes Selbstbewusstsein und Organisationsf\u00e4higkeit als unumg\u00e4nglich.\nKontakte kn\u00fcpfen beim Feuerwehrfest\n\"Beim Community Nursing sind Gesundheits- und Krankenpfleger*innen anders eingesetzt als im Krankenhaus. Sie haben nicht jederzeit ein Team hinter sich, sondern gehen alleine auf Hausbesuch\", sagt Feichtinger. \"Sie versorgen auch sehr komplexe F\u00e4lle, etwa Personen, die viele verschiedene Erkrankungen, einen schwachen sozialen Status, keine finanziellen Mittel oder Migrationshintergrund haben. Es braucht verschiedenste Interventionen, um so einen Fall zu versorgen.\"\nOft erscheint es nicht offensichtlich, welche Menschen einen dringenden Bedarf an Hilfestellungen daheim haben, diese m\u00fcssen erst einmal gefunden werden. In ihren Einsatzbereichen versuchen Community Nurses auf unterschiedliche Weise, Kontakte zu kn\u00fcpfen. \"Viele stellen sich \u00fcberall vor, wo Menschen zusammenkommen, etwa in der Bank, beim Lebensmittelgesch\u00e4ft oder auf dem Feuerwehrfest. Auch durch Anzeigen in Gemeindezeitungen, Plakate oder Infost\u00e4nde wird das Angebot beworben, um bei jenen Menschen anzukommen, f\u00fcr die es gedacht ist.\u201c\nKeine Kosten und viel Zeit\nIm Fokus steht die Altersgruppe 75 plus. Durch die EU-F\u00f6rderung kann das Angebot momentan kostenlos genutzt werden. \"Dass keine Kosten anfallen, ist ein riesiger Vorteil. Das nimmt die Barriere, ein Angebot anzunehmen, das man noch nicht kennt\", ist Feichtinger \u00fcberzeugt. \"Ebenso positive Auswirkung bringt die Tatsache, dass keine strengen Zeitvorgaben den Besuch verk\u00fcrzen oder einschr\u00e4nken. Community Nurses k\u00f6nnen sich Zeit nehmen, um Vertrauen zu ihren Klient*innen aufzubauen.\" Wie lange F\u00e4lle betreut werden, ist individuell unterschiedlich. \"Manchmal ist es nur ein kurzer Kontakt, sehr oft handelt es sich jedoch um eine Begleitung \u00fcber Monate hinweg. Das Wichtigste ist die aktive Fallverfolgung.\"\nUnterst\u00fctzung bei gesellschaftlicher Teilhabe\nEin weiteres Aufgabengebiet von Community Nurses ist Informationsweitergabe mit dem Ziel, die Gesundheitskompetenz in der Bev\u00f6lkerung zu st\u00e4rken. Bei gr\u00f6\u00dferen Veranstaltungen halten sie etwa Vortr\u00e4ge zu verschiedenen Pflegeph\u00e4nomenen oder geben Schulungen, um \u00e4lteren Menschen zu erkl\u00e4ren, wie das Gesundheitssystem und seine digitalen Schnittstellen funktionieren. Besonders am Community Nursing ist auch, dass es nicht nur um die k\u00f6rperliche Gesundheit geht, sondern auch um gesellschaftliche Teilhabe.\n\"In \u00d6sterreich gibt es sehr viele Angebote, aber Personen wissen oft nichts davon. Wenn jemand daheim einsam ist, aber eigentlich gerne tanzt, kann eine Community Nurse aufzeigen, wo sie Gelegenheit dazu findet\", sagt Feichtinger.

Der Aufbau von Grund auf bietet die Gelegenheit, einen Stadtteil gleich von Anfang an energieeffizient und klimafreundlich zu gestalten. Um daf\u00fcr notwendige Technologien zu entwickeln, wurde das Forschungsinstitut Aspern Smart City Research (ASCR) geschaffen. In den vergangenen 10 Jahren hat ASCR eine Vielzahl von Projekten durchgef\u00fchrt, die sich auch \u00fcber die Seestadt hinaus erstrecken. Die Erkenntnisse daraus flie\u00dfen in Produkte von Miteigent\u00fcmer Siemens ein und kommen weltweit zur Anwendung.\nF\u00fcr Wien sei die Forschungst\u00e4tigkeit wichtig, weil die f\u00fcnftgr\u00f6\u00dfte Stadt der EU die Dekarbonisierung bis 2040 \u201enicht leicht im Vorbeigehen schaffen werde\u201c, sagt Wirtschaftsstadtrat Peter Hanke anl\u00e4sslich der Vorstellung der n\u00e4chsten (3.) Programmperiode von ASCR. Es bedarf gro\u00dfer Anstrengungen und viel Know-how.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Fernw\u00e4rme: So schlagen wir uns im europ\u00e4ischen Vergleich\nNetz gleichzeitig stabil und flexibel machen\nEines der Forschungsgebiete ist das Smart Grid. Das intelligente Stromnetz der Zukunft m\u00fcsse ganz anders aufgebaut sein als bisher. \u201eIch habe fr\u00fcher in der Netzplanung gearbeitet. Die Wiener Netze hatten damals 9 Stromeinspeiser. Heute sind es 27.000\u201c, sagt Peter Weinelt, Generaldirektor der Wiener Stadtwerke. Was die Forschung in der Seestadt Aspern hervorgebracht habe, seien etwa Automatisierungsl\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr das Niederspannungsnetz, erz\u00e4hlen Matthias Gressel und Harald Loos, die beiden Co-Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer von ASCR.\nMit neu entwickelten Mechanismen k\u00f6nne die Stromproduktion aus vielen verschiedenen Quellen, etwa Photovoltaik-Anlagen auf Hausd\u00e4chern, und der Verbrauch besser austariert werden. Ein wichtiges Mittel daf\u00fcr seien digitale Zwillinge, mit denen Energiefl\u00fcsse simuliert und optimiert werden k\u00f6nnen. Mit neuer Smart-Grid-Technologie k\u00f6nne man Angebot und Bedarf auch zeitlich flexibler gestalten. In der Seestadt wurde die Speicherung von Strom mittels Batterien oder durch Umwandlung in W\u00e4rme erforscht.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Wieso Umspannwerke f\u00fcr die Energiewende so wichtig sind\nIntensiv erforscht wird auch die Heizung und K\u00fchlung von Geb\u00e4uden. Getestet wurde etwa die Kombination verschiedener Heizsysteme, wie Solarthermie, Geothermie und Fernw\u00e4rme. Fu\u00dfbodenheizungen wurden f\u00fcr die K\u00fchlung im Sommer genutzt. Wertvoll sei auch gewesen, auftretende Schwierigkeiten zu entdecken. Wenn Heizungen etwa darauf ausgelegt sind, Badezimmer im Winter st\u00e4rker zu heizen, w\u00fcrden sie im Sommer auch st\u00e4rker gek\u00fchlt werden \u2013 was wohl unangenehm w\u00e4re.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Geothermie: Der schlummernde Riese in der Tiefe\nFakten\n25.000 Menschen sollen in den 2030er-Jahren in der Seestadt Aspern wohnen. 20.000 Arbeits- und Ausbildungspl\u00e4tze sollen entstehen.\nFertiggestellt ist bisher nur ungef\u00e4hr die H\u00e4lfte der Seestadt Aspern.\nEigent\u00fcmer des Forschungsinstituts ASCR sind Siemens (49,1 %), Wiener Netze, Wiener Stadtwerke und der Stadt Wien.\n36 Millionen Euro sind f\u00fcr die dritte Programmperiode von ASCR von 2024 bis 2028 vorgesehen. Das gesamte Investitionsvolumen steigt damit auf \u00fcber 100 Millionen Euro.\nGarage verhandelt \u00fcber den Strombedarf\nIn der Seestadt werden Geb\u00e4ude und darin installierte Ladeinfrastruktur f\u00fcr Elektrofahrzeuge auch als Einheit betrachtet. In einer Parkgarage wurde etwa erprobt, wie Stromnetz und Geb\u00e4ude miteinander kommunizieren und \u00fcber den Stromverbrauch verhandeln k\u00f6nnen.\n\u201eDer Garage wird dabei mitgeteilt, wie viel Leistung ihr zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt zur Verf\u00fcgung steht. Damit muss sie dann auskommen\u201c, sagt Gressel. Durch intelligentes Lademanagement werden E-Autos zu unterschiedlichen Zeiten oder mit variierender Leistung aufgeladen. E-Auto-Fahrer*innen haben dabei mittels App ein W\u00f6rtchen mitzureden und k\u00f6nnen dadurch etwa ausrichten, wann das Auto sp\u00e4testens wieder aufgeladen sein soll.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: E-Auto g\u00fcnstig und stressfrei laden: So soll es funktionieren\nAuch Fragen der Privatsph\u00e4re beim Datenaustausch und rechtliche Aspekte zwischen Ladestellen- und Garagenbetreiber wurden dabei behandelt. Optimiert man die Informationsfl\u00fcsse, k\u00f6nne man einen gro\u00dfen Effizienzgewinn erzielen, sagt Loos. \"Au\u00dferdem kann man den Stromnetzausbau und daf\u00fcr anfallende Kosten so in Grenzen halten.\"\nSanierung alter Geb\u00e4ude neu im Fokus\nIn den n\u00e4chsten 5 Jahren will sich das ASCR auf Bestandsgeb\u00e4ude fokussieren. Die Auswirkungen von thermischer Sanierung, das Ersetzen von \u00d6l- und Gasheizungen oder die Verbesserung von Internetanschl\u00fcssen werden dabei etwa erforscht. Au\u00dferdem will man Quartiersl\u00f6sungen entwickeln.

Bei gewissen Ma\u00dfnahmen m\u00fcsse man vorsichtig vorgehen, sagt Loos: \"Wenn ich etwa an einem Geb\u00e4ude arbeite, in dem Leute wohnen oder arbeiten, darf es nicht sein, dass sie in der Fr\u00fch hinkommen und es hat pl\u00f6tzlich nur noch 10 Grad und ist finster.\" Bestehende Geb\u00e4ude zu modernisieren, sei ein \"Mehrgenerationenthema\", sagt Reichelt. \"Aber irgendwann ist uns daf\u00fcr der internationale Gaspreis nicht mehr so wichtig.

Nearly, that is, because the dogged researchers and enthusiasts at The Serial Port channel on YouTube have found what is likely the last existing copy of Archie. Archie, first crafted by Alan Emtage while a student at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, allowed for the searching of various \"anonymous\" FTP servers around what was then a very small web of universities, researchers, and government and military nodes. It was groundbreaking; it was the first echo of the \"anything, anywhere\" Internet to come.

One such example is the application of the Fourier transform, which transforms a data set from the time domain into the frequency domain. Yet what is this frequency domain really? After enticing us to follow the white rabbit down a sudden plummet into the intangible question of what is and what is not, [lcamtuf] shows us around aspects of the frequency domain and kin.\nOne thing about the (discrete) Fourier transform is that it is excellent at analyzing data that consists out of sinewaves, such as audio signals. Yet when using the Fourier transform for square waves, the resulting output is less than useful, almost as if square waves are not real. Similarly, other transforms exist which work great for square waves, but turn everything else into meaningless harmonics. Starting with the discrete cosine transform (DCT), this gets us into Walsh and Hadamard matrices and the Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), and their usage with transforming data from the time into the frequency domain.\nUltimately it would seem that the frequency domain is as real as it needs to be, albeit that its appearance is wholly dependent on the algorithm used to create it, whether this the DFT, DCT, WHT or something else entirely.\n20 thoughts on \u201cIs The Frequency Domain A Real Place?\u201d\nAbsolutely not. It is a mapping from the time domain to a Complex space.\nWe don\u2019t even know if reality is real, so it\u2019s probably a moot point :D\nWhen you\u2019re walking along an airport trav-o-lator in a hurry, the frequency domain is the place where you find the exit.\nAs for square waves not being real, I\u2019m sure there are plenty of oscilloscope-havers ready to pounce on that\nOnly those that don\u2019t have enough resolution or haven\u2019t zoomed in enough. Square waves aren\u2019t real.\nInstantaneous change is a physical impossibility. Real square waves are slope and/or bandwidth limited and real measurement equipment is too.\nSometimes it\u2019s real. Sometimes it\u2019s imaginary. But, generally, it\u2019s complex.\n> Yet when using the Fourier transform for square waves, the resulting output is less than useful, almost as if square waves are not real.\nOn the contrary, that infinite progression of harmonics is quite informative \u2014 it tells you that in any physical process that can\u2019t keep up with infinitely high frequencies (which is all of them), those square waves and their instantaneous transitions can only be idealized approximations. Or in other words, it\u2019s correctly suggesting that square waves aren\u2019t real.\n\u201cwhen using the Fourier transform for square waves, the resulting output is less than useful\u201d\nLess than useful? Not in the least. It\u2019s useful if you need to know if you can get that signal through a limited-bandwidth transmission channel. Those OTHER transforms, though, those are pretty much useless. And I still don\u2019t understand how the (missing) sine information gets reconstituted when doing a reverse DCT. Yeah, I sorta get it, that since the original signal was totally real, you should only need the cosines, but I don\u2019t understand where the phase information is encoded.\nAt least in the use of the DCT for video compression, the phase info is not encoded because it is not needed.\nI found the answer here, by the way: https://www.thebroadcastbridge.com/content/entry/18568/transforms-part-6-dct. TLDR: the data set is duplicated and mirrored, resulting in there being two results for each discrete frequency. I haven\u2019t done the math myself, so I still don\u2019t QUITE get it, but at least there are the same number of samples in the transformed data as in the original, so I can hand-wave that at least it COULD be possible to recreate the original data from the DCT. That\u2019s the part that had been bothering me.\nThe cosine function is an even function, while the sine function is odd.\nDue to the mirroring, the input data is a (discrete) even function, and thus it can be represented by a linear combination of only even functions. Hence no sine functions are needed.\nI hate to be nasty, but please don\u2019t let someone who knows nothing about Fourier transforms write an article about them. That piece about square waves is cringeworthy.\nI would challenge the author to point to a square wave ever created anywhere. Like, WOW! \u2013 from 0 Volts to MAX Volts in 0.0000000000000,,, Attoseconds!\nWell square waves are as real as a dirac delta funtion. Which is not at all in a real physical world. You can try to get near to it ( case of the dirac one might argue mankind has build the largest, most complex and most expensive structures possible, like the LHC) but it can\u2019t be reacched. There is no instant change of anything. Every change need time. You pay dearly to get the slew rate up.\n\u201cOne thing about the (discrete) Fourier transform is that it is excellent at analyzing data that consists out of sinewaves, such as audio signals. Yet when using the Fourier transform for square waves, the resulting output is less than useful,\u201d\nI feel a bit out of competence when it comes to signal processing but I think you should be more specific, because now it looks like audio signals can\u2019t be square. There is and audio signal called square wave \u2013 it is available in almost every synth based on subtractive synthesis (both analog and digital). Of course that square wave is not \u201creally\u201d square since at the moment there is no known method to produce \u201ctruly square\u201d signal except using \u201cinfinite energy\u201d \u2013 all we get is \u201cclose enough for this application\u201d. Depending on method, oscillators will produce only band limited square wave at best \u2013 look up for oscilloscope view on some synths like Minimoog or Virus and you will see clear difference but for the application it is close enough. Digital synths also produce some \u201crandom noise\u201d on the beginning which is nothing but band limited start of the signal (to avoid \u201cpopping\u201d every time you play a note). Maybe that is why it seem \u201calmost as if square waves are not real\u201d \u2013 they are not possible to be produced.\nNo, it\u2019s imaginary\nI have a question about FFT, since i\u2019m currently trying to compare some tape players performances by digitizing the same music track from them using Audacity, and then use the \u201cPlot spectrum\u201d tool. But there\u2019s a \u201csize\u201d parameter that gives me some trouble.\nThe documentation says \u201cIn Spectrum, a larger size gives more accurate frequency resolution (narrow bands), but averages the result over a longer period of time (because more samples are needed for the calculation)\u201d.\nAnd i indeed can see that increasing the size gives me finer details in frequency, so seems to be better. But at the same time, i can see that more details/bands implies lower dB level for each individual band. So when looking at the overall graph from the same file, choosing a low 128 size parameter produces a graph with near linear decreasing from -6dB for 350Hz to -42dB for 16kHz. But if i choose the highest 65536 size, the graph starts at -65db for 1Hz, has a peak level of only -18dB (so very much lower that -6dB max in previous one) for 50Hz, 350 Hz is now only -30dB (instead of -6), and is at about -70dB for 15kHz.\nSo all in all, the range between 350Hz and 16kHz goes from -6 to -42dB with the lowest size, but only from -30 to -70dB with the highest size. So the overall graph seems to plot much lower levels with increasing size parameter.\nIn a way i can understand that larger slots of frequencies will measure and average the sum of them. But at the same time, since music is not made of high level carriers, a finer slot will have a lower contribution in the overall spectrum.\nBut this difference of about 25dB in levels is also confusing for me, since the same file could look quite good to quite terrible, depending on the parameter. So i don\u2019t know which size would gives me a better and the most true representation of my players performances.\nI hope that my explanations are clear enough, and that someone smarter that me would be able to give me some advice about how to use this parameter the best way possible.\nBertrand Russell said, \u201cmathematics is that branch of science where we do not understand the things we talk about, and do not care if the things we say about them are true.\u201d\nNegative numbers only came into use in the 1600s, and mathematicians were arguing about whether they were \u2018real\u2019 until the 1800s.\nThe whole notion of mathemetical systems being \u2018real\u2019 is frivolous. The important question mathematically is whether they\u2019re interesting. The important question scientifically is whether they\u2019re useful.\nThe frequency domain turns out to be both.\nHow Imaginary Numbers Were Invented\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUzklzVXJwo\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Hinzu komme das finanzielle Interesse des Verurteilten: Durch die eigens eingerichtete Kryptow\u00e4hrung TORN habe er an der durch Dritte durchgef\u00fchrten Geldw\u00e4sche mitverdient.\n\u00dcberhaupt sei durch Chats belegt, dass dem Trio klar gewesen sei, wof\u00fcr ihr Dienst genutzt wird. Sie h\u00e4tten bewusst keinerlei Vorkehrungen getroffen. Sp\u00e4ter hinzugef\u00fcgte Scripte zur Sperre bestimmter Wallets seien wirkungslos gewesen, weil Geldw\u00e4scher einerseits andere Wallets nutzen oder einfach das Script ausschalten k\u00f6nnen, ohne auf die Kryptowaschmaschine Tornado Cash verzichten zu m\u00fcssen.\nUS-Prozess gegen Mitverd\u00e4chtige\nZus\u00e4tzlich zur Haftstrafe ordnet das Gericht den Verfall beschlagnahmter Kryptow\u00e4hrungen sowie eines Porsche im Gesamtwert von rund zwei Millionen Euro an. Kryptow\u00e4hrungen und ein Macbook im Gesamtwerk von etwa 160.000 Euro erh\u00e4lt P. hingegen zur\u00fcck. Details dazu gehen aus der Urteilsbegr\u00fcndung nicht hervor. P. sa\u00df seit August 2022 in Untersuchungshaft. Diese wird ihm auf die Haftstrafe angerechnet. Der Strafe liegt nachgewiesene W\u00e4sche von \u00fcber einer Milliarde Dollar aus Verbrechensbeuten zugrunde. US-Beh\u00f6rden geben an, W\u00e4sche von mehr als sieben Milliarden Dollar nachweisen zu k\u00f6nnen.\nDie beiden Mitverd\u00e4chtigen Roman Storm und Roman Semenow sind in den USA wegen Krypto-Geldw\u00e4sche mit Tornado Cash angeklagt. Der Erstgenannte ist dort in Haft, der Letztgenannte d\u00fcrfte sich in Dubai dem Zugriff der Justiz entziehen. In einem Online-Posting beschimpft Semenow die niederl\u00e4ndische Justiz als \"blind und taub f\u00fcr die wahre Genialit\u00e4t und Innovation Aleksejs und Tornado Cashs\".

Adopting RAG empowers businesses to leverage external knowledge, enhance accuracy, and create more robust AI applications. It\u2019s a strategic move toward building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between generative capabilities and authoritative information. Below are topics in this blog. \n\nBrief History of AI \nWhat are Large Language Models (LLMS). \nLimitation of LLMS. \nHow can we incorporate domain knowledge. \nWhat is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). \nWhat is Robust retrieval for RAG Apps.  \n\nOnce we are done with these concepts, I hope to convince you to adopt RAG in your project. \n \nBrief History of AI \n \nThe concept of having intelligent systems started in 1950s when Artificial intelligence was introduced as a field of computer science. In 1959 Machine Learning was introduced as a subset of AI. 2017 the concept of deep learning took over as a way of using neural networks to process data and make decisions. From 2021(birth of Generative AI) till now we are in the error of Generative AI which basically creates response (images, text, audio or video) when given prompts(query) on the data it has been trained on. In summary Generative AIs are Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of generating coherent and contextual responses. \n \n\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat are Large Language Models (LLMS)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAn LLM is a model that is so large that it achieves general-purpose language understanding and generation. When an LLM is trained on data to give sentiment when prompted with a review should be able to produce positive or negative sentiment as its output.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nOn Azure for example we have various models which can be deployed via Azure OpenAI or Azure AI Studio and be readily available to consume, fine-tune and even train using different parameters.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTalking about Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) models which are one of the models available in Azure, they are trained on the next word prediction task.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLimitations of LLMS\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLLMS have been faced by various limitations ie\u00a0\n\nBias and Hallucination\u00a0\nUnforeseen Consequences ie harmful information\u00a0\n\nAmong others which have been solved ie Microsoft adheres to strong Ethical guidelines and polices for responsible AI practices. Which helps in resolving the issue of unforeseen consequences. Fine-Tuning and Customization helps to reduce bias and hallucinations of LLMs.\u00a0\nThe biggest limitation of all LLMs is Outdated Public knowledge and no internal knowledge.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nTo solve this, we must incorporate techniques offered by domain knowledge.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIncorporating Domain Knowledge\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIncorporating domain knowledge into LLMs is crucial for enhancing their performance and making them more contextually relevant. Examples are\u00a0\n\nPrompt engineering \u2013 it relies on in-context learning whereby LLMs like GPT-3 is trained on vast amounts of text data to predict the next token based on preceding text.\u00a0\nFine-tuning - involves training an LLM on a smaller dataset specific to a particular domain. By fine-tuning, the model adapts its pre-learned knowledge to the nuances of the target domain.\u00a0\n\nBoth In-context learning and fine turning don\u2019t address the issue of Outdated Public knowledge. This brings us to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRAG is based on the concept of an LLM leaning new facts temporarily. RAG with Azure OpenAI allows developers to use supported AI chat models that can reference specific sources of information to ground the response. Adding this information allows the model to reference both the specific data provided and its pretrained knowledge to provide more effective responses.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAzure OpenAI enables RAG by connecting pretrained models to your own data sources. Azure OpenAI on your data utilizes the search ability of Azure AI Search to add the relevant data chunks to the prompt. Once your data is in a AI Search index, Azure OpenAI on your data goes through the following steps:\u00a0\n\nReceive user prompt.\u00a0\nDetermine relevant content and intent of the prompt.\u00a0\nQuery the search index with that content and intent.\u00a0\n\n\nInsert search result chunk into the Azure OpenAI prompt, along with system message and user prompt.\u00a0\nSend the entire prompt to Azure OpenAI.\u00a0\nReturn response and data reference (if any) to the user.\u00a0\n\nThis concept enables LLMs to learn fast and efficiently beating the process for fine-tuning which is both costly and time intensive, and should only be used for use cases where it's necessary.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRobust retrieval for RAG Apps\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo achieve robust retrieval for RAG Apps we must first consider the importance of the search step (in the image above). Below are points to keep in mind ie responses from RAG Apps are only as good as retrieved data.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nWe can also achieve robust retrieval in our RAG apps by incorporating vector-based search and vector databases.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRead more \u00a0\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in Azure AI Search\u00a0\nImplement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Azure OpenAI Service\u00a0\nRetrieval augmented generation and indexes\u00a0\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Azure AI Document Intelligence (formerly Form Recognizer)\u00a0\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation with Azure AI Document Intelligence\u00a0\n\n\u00a0", "hash": "0f6c83bd5f6a9bd78a53b53a5e30454d084cbc7f62d71fa93cb320761e4aeb03", "id": "f0764627-af17-4724-a86a-bd92a56d94ad", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/educator-developer-blog/why-should-business-adopt-rag-and-migrate-from-llms/ba-p/4138015", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-17T00:00:00", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "35fb504c-68bd-4462-b168-23b040221e25", "title": "Why Should Business Adopt RAG and migrate from LLMs?"}], "tags": {"LLM": {"name": "LLM", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "LLMs": {"name": "LLMs", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "RAG": {"name": "RAG", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Retrieval Augmented Generation": {"name": "Retrieval Augmented Generation", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Why Should Business Adopt RAG and migrate from LLMs?"}]
