Thus, the policy will only be applied to these resources.\n \nThe \"details\" section outlines the specific operations performed by the policy. Here, the \"effect\" is set to \"deployIfNotExists\", indicating that the policy will take action only if the defined conditions are not already met. The \"type\" and \"name\" fields specify the resource details that should exist. The \"existenceCondition\" then checks whether the fields \"Microsoft.Web/sites/config/managedServiceIdentityId\" and \"Microsoft.Web/sites/config/xmanagedServiceIdentityId\" already exist. If these fields exist, it implies that Managed Identity is already enabled for the App Service, and the policy doesn't need to take any action.\n \nThe \"deployment\" section provides the details of the action to be taken if the \"existenceCondition\" is not met. It includes an ARM template that deploys a 'Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts' resource. This script will execute the Azure PowerShell command to enable Managed Identity on the App Service.\n\n \nBefore we dive into more details, it's worth noting that this solution can be implemented either from the command-line or from the Azure Portal. The steps below guide you through the command-line process. However, if you prefer using the GUI, you can refer to the following documents for creating managed identity and policy from Azure Portal:\n\n\nManage user-assigned managed identities - Managed identities for Azure resources | Microsoft Learn\n\n\nAssign Azure roles using the Azure portal - Azure RBAC | Microsoft Learn\n\n\nTutorial: Build policies to enforce compliance - Azure Policy | Microsoft Learn\n\n\n \nYou can follow the steps below to implement this solution from the command-line.\n \nStep 0: Create a User Managed Identity and Assign RBAC Role:\nDeployment scripts require a security principal to run Azure CLI/PowerShell commands/scripts.  Therefore, prior to implementing the policy, we need to prepare a\u00a0user-assigned Managed Identity with the necessary permissions. \u00a0This identity will be passed as a policy parameter for script execution. Please note, this identity should not be confused with the system-managed identity utilized for app service apps.\n\u00a0\nIn this example, we will create a new user assigned managed identity and assign it the Contributor role to the scope where we intend to assign the policy. \u00a0\n\nCreate User Managed Identity:\n\nOpen your Azure PowerShell and create a new user managed identity with the following command:\nNew-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupName> -Name <IdentityName>\nEnsure to replace <ResourceGroupName> and <IdentityName> with your resource group name and the desired name for the new identity.\n\nAssign the Contributor Role:\n\nNext, we will assign the Contributor role to this user managed identity. This role allows the identity to manage resources in Azure. Use the following command to assign the role:\nNew-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId <PrincipalId> -RoleDefinitionName 'Contributor' -Scope \"/subscriptions/<SubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<ResourceGroupName>\"\n\nReplace <PrincipalId> with the principal id of the User Managed Identity you just created. Replace <SubscriptionId> and <ResourceGroupName> with your Azure subscription id and resource group name respectively.\n\u00a0\nStep 1: Create a JSON file:\nCreate a JSON file and paste the provided JSON policy object in it. You can name the file as per your convenience, let's name it \"policy.json\".\n\u00a0\nStep 2: Create a Policy Definition:\nNow, create a policy definition using Azure PowerShell with the following command:\nNew-AzPolicyDefinition -Name 'SystemManagedIdentity' -DisplayName 'Deploy System Managed Identity for Azure App Services' -Description 'This policy deploys system managed identity to Azure App services' -Policy 'policy.json' -Mode Indexed\n\n\u00a0\nStep 3: Assign the Policy:\nOnce the policy is defined, we need to assign it to a scope. This scope could be a management group, subscription, resource group, or individual resources. Use the following command to assign the policy:\nNew-AzPolicyAssignment -Name 'SystemManagedIdentityAssignment' -Scope '/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}' -PolicyDefinition 'SystemManagedIdentity' -PolicyParameterObject @{ \"userAssignedIdentities\" = @{ \"value\" = \"/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/{userAssignedManagedIdentityName}\" } }\n\nEnsure to replace {subscriptionId},\u00a0{resourceGroupName}\u00a0and {userAssignedManagedIdentityName} with your subscription id, resource group name and user assigned managed identity name respectively.\n\u00a0\nConclusion:\nBy following these steps, you can enable the system managed identity for Azure App services using a policy. This methodology provides a standardized and automated way to ensure that your Azure App services are always running with system managed identities. It not only helps to eliminate the manual process of enabling managed identities but also reduces the risk of misconfigurations. This, in turn, helps in securing your Azure environment and makes the management of identities simpler and more consistent.\n", "hash": "efe37a45b7101e34e12e29afc3cc0896ad2a70102ada52459cb4bf9e46eaf10f", "id": "f8e8c442-c0d6-46a7-b3d5-726b37463c5f", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-paas-blog/automatically-enable-system-managed-identity-for-app-service/ba-p/4108293", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-22T22:37:05", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "3c1d0dbc-42e1-4853-9978-4a9c66362b67", "title": "Automatically enable system managed identity for App Service apps with Azure Policy"}], "tags": {"DINE": {"name": "DINE", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "JSON": {"name": "JSON", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Automatically enable system managed identity for App Service apps with Azure Policy"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-23T01:14:30.685423", "id": "1ae04263-ab3c-4f74-8d09-9373e715c598", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "6"}, {"created": "2024-05-23T01:10:09.453520", "id": "e3304e43-00df-41f7-a50b-19eab799339c", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-22T22:36:00", "id": "c1e1be9e-ddfe-4b1b-9a55-7843454c4c35", "news_items": [{"author": "Daniel AJ Sokolov", "content": "Preiserh\u00f6hungen: \u00d6sterreichische Netflix-Kunden erhalten Geld zur\u00fcck\n2019 und 2020 hat Netflix in \u00d6sterreich die Preise erh\u00f6ht.

The script loops through each policy and creates a remediation task for all \"deployIfNotExists\" or \"modify\" effect policies with non-compliant resources.\n \nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the script:\n\nDeclare your Initiative name as variables.\n\n$InitiativeAssignmentName = \"<myInitiativeAssignment>\"\n\nThe script then retrieves all non-compliant policies that can be remediated within the initiative.\n\n$RemediatablePolicies = Get-AzPolicyState | Where-Object { $_.PolicyAssignmentName -eq $InitiativeAssignmentName -and ($_.PolicyDefinitionAction -eq \"deployIfNotExists\" -or $_.PolicyDefinitionAction -eq \"modify\" -or $_.PolicyDefinitionAction -eq \"append\") } | select-object PolicyDefinitionReferenceId, PolicyAssignmentId -Unique\n\nIt then loops through each policy and creates individual remediation tasks.\n\nforeach ($policy in $RemediatablePolicies) {\n   $remediationName = \"rem.\" + $policy.PolicyDefinitionReferenceId\n   Start-AzPolicyRemediation -Name $remediationName -PolicyAssignmentId $policy.PolicyAssignmentId -PolicyDefinitionReferenceId $policy.PolicyDefinitionReferenceId -ResourceDiscoveryMode ReEvaluateCompliance\n}\n \nDetailed Explanation:1. The variable $InitiativeAssignmentName should be assigned the actual name of your Initiative.2. The $RemediatablePolicies line fetches all non-compliant policies from Azure which can be remediated based on the conditions specified in the Where-Object cmdlet. It uses the Initiative name provided and filters based on the policy definition actions (either \"deployIfNotExists\", \"modify\", or \"append\"). It then selects policies based on their PolicyDefinitionReferenceId and PolicyAssignmentId. The \"-Unique\" flag is used to remove duplicates.3. The foreach loop then iterates through each of these policies. For each policy, a remediation task is created with a unique name by concatenating \"rem.\" with the policy's PolicyDefinitionReferenceId. This remediation task is then started using the Start-AzPolicyRemediation cmdlet. This cmdlet uses the previously created unique name, the policy's PolicyAssignmentId and PolicyDefinitionReferenceId, and a ResourceDiscoveryMode of ReEvaluateCompliance to start the remediation task.\n \nPlease find the complete script from below:\n\nComplete Script\n# Declare your Initiative name as variables\n$InitiativeAssignmentName = \"<your initiative name>\"\n\n \n# Get all non-compliant policies that can be remediated\n$RemediatablePolicies = Get-AzPolicyState | Where-Object { $_.PolicyAssignmentName -eq $InitiativeAssignmentName -and ($_.PolicyDefinitionAction -eq \"deployIfNotExists\" -or $_.PolicyDefinitionAction -eq \"modify\" -or $_.PolicyDefinitionAction -eq \"append\") } | select-object PolicyDefinitionReferenceId, PolicyAssignmentId -Unique\n   \n# Loop through each policy and create individual remediation tasks\nforeach ($policy in $RemediatablePolicies) {\n   $remediationName = \"rem.\" + $policy.PolicyDefinitionReferenceId\n   Start-AzPolicyRemediation -Name $remediationName -PolicyAssignmentId $policy.PolicyAssignmentId -PolicyDefinitionReferenceId $policy.PolicyDefinitionReferenceId -ResourceDiscoveryMode ReEvaluateCompliance\n}\n \nWith this script, you can automate the process of creating remediation tasks for each policy in a policy initiative. You can customize this script as per your requirements, or use it as a starting point to build more complex automation workflows.\n\n \nSummary and Conclusion\nIn this blog post, we've highlighted a common challenge when dealing with policy remediation tasks for policy initiatives and presented a solution using Azure PowerShell to automate this process. The provided script offers a way to loop through all non-compliant policies and start remediation tasks for each, significantly simplifying the process and saving valuable time.\n \nAs always, we recommend testing this script in a controlled environment before deploying it in a production scenario. For further details on the remediation cmdlets, you can refer to the Azure PowerShell documentation.\n \nI hope this post has been helpful.

While it's still unclear how many individuals' personal and protected health information was stolen during the February ransomware attack, we do know it's a very, very large number of Americans.\n\"Based on the initial targeted data sampling to date, the company has found files containing protected health information and personally identifiable information, which could cover a substantial proportion of people in America,\" Change Healthcare's parent company UnitedHealth said in an April statement.\nUnitedHealth CEO: 'Decision to pay ransom was mine'\n-\nUnitedHealth admits IT security breach could 'cover substantial proportion of people in America'\n-\nUnitedHealth's 'egregious negligence' led to Change Healthcare ransomware infection\n-\nChange Healthcare's ransomware attack costs edge toward $1B so far\n-\nThe 1996 US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), designed to protect Americans' medical records and other health-related info, requires entities to notify HHS' Office for Civil Rights, media outlets, and affected individuals about incidents in which more than 500 people's data has been compromised.\nChange Healthcare is a HIPAA-covered entity, and the digital intrusion definitely affected more than 500 individuals. \"Providers affected by this breach are so numerous that a specific number is not readily available,\" according to the letter.\nIt continues:\nA simple affirmation from OCR, as requested herein, that UHG, as the covered entity which experienced the breach is responsible for fulfilling the attendant breach reporting and notification requirements, is badly needed to address the lack of clarity among the community of affected providers. Given UHG's statement that it is prepared to fulfill these reporting and notification requirements, it appears that it would be a quick and straightforward matter for OCR to confirm publicly that the HIPAA breach notification and reporting requirements are applicable to UHG and not to the affected providers. Given the well documented state of chaos in the provider community in the wake of this breach, OCR's silence on this point is disappointing.\nWhen asked about the HHS letter and medical providers' concerns, a UnitedHealth spokesperson referred The Register to CEO Andrew Witty's congressional testimony on May 1.\n\"We will, of course, comply with legal requirements and provide notice to affected individuals, and have offered to our customers and clients to provide notice on their behalf where it is permitted,\" Witty told US lawmakers. \"We are working closely with HHS's Office of Civil Rights to make sure our notice is effective, useful and complies with the law.\"\nAlso on May 1, Witty told US senators that the business paid $22 million to the extortionists, reportedly an affiliate of the BlackCat/ALPH ransomware crew.\n\"As chief executive officer, the decision to pay a ransom was mine,\" he said. \"This was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make. And I wouldn't wish it on anyone.\"\nWitty also confirmed to Congress that past and present US military personnel likely had their info stolen during the intrusion.\nThe total clean-up costs to date associated with the breach have hit $872 million, and are expected to climb even higher. That's in addition to advance funding and interest-free loans UnitedHealth doled out to providers struggling to care for patients amid the disruption. This sum is said to be north of $6 billion. \u00ae", "hash": "be36d6ca61e50566e9ba681e57cb19f85491a8ac0662c7f6f49e1b9a63b0b53f", "id": "48c21327-c951-4cf7-90e6-b5460afba74b", "link": "https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2024/05/22/change_healthcare_hippa/", "osint_source_id": "a94d3f15-5689-470c-9d1f-670b8c63491d", "published": "2024-05-22T22:05:14", "source": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/headlines.atom", "story_id": "b2777ab5-f87b-48d7-8bbf-511229a1cfaa", "title": "Go after UnitedHealth, not us, 100+ medical groups urge Uncle Sam"}], "tags": {"America": {"name": "America", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Americans": {"name": "Americans", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Americans'": {"name": "Americans'", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Andrew Witty": {"name": "Andrew Witty", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Change Healthcare": {"name": "Change Healthcare", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Congress": {"name": "Congress", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Feds": {"name": "Feds", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "HHS": {"name": "HHS", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "HIPAA-covered": {"name": "HIPAA-covered", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "OCR": {"name": "OCR", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Security breach": {"name": "Security breach", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "UHG": {"name": "UHG", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "UnitedHealth": {"name": "UnitedHealth", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "UnitedHealth Group": {"name": "UnitedHealth Group", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Witty": {"name": "Witty", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Xavier Becerra": {"name": "Xavier Becerra", "tag_type": "PER"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Go after UnitedHealth, not us, 100+ medical groups urge Uncle Sam"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-23T01:24:21.677406", "id": "c8dfd3b9-9141-47c7-8b40-ca5f96fa4525", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "30"}, {"created": "2024-05-23T01:13:57.946501", "id": "eb948f16-1092-4e85-b944-914bedc59620", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-22T22:02:00", "id": "75146576-dda7-4673-a962-8aa05287da5c", "news_items": [{"author": "BeauHD", "content": "People With Commonly Autocorrected Names Call For Tech Firms To Fix Problem (theguardian.com) 43\nAn anonymous reader quotes a report from The Guardian: People whose names get mangled by autocorrect have urged technology companies to fix the problem faster, with one person whose name gets switched to \"Satan\" saying: \"I am tired of it.\" People with Irish, Indian and Welsh names are among those calling for improvements to the systems that operate on phones and computers as part of the \"I am not a typo\" campaign. \"It is important that technology becomes more inclusive,\" said Savan-Chandni Gandecha, 34, a British Indian content creator whose name, which means monsoon moonlight, has been autocorrected to Satan. \"My name has also been corrected to Savant,\" he said. \"It is sometimes corrected to Savan, or the hyphen is not accepted by online forms and that irks me,\" he said. \"Even in India my name gets corrected to \"Sawan\", and it's not just an English issue.

mehr Ger\u00e4te ans Internet anzuschlie\u00dfen, gelten Starlink & Co als Mittel der Wahl. Doch oft bleiben nur kurze Zeitfenster f\u00fcr Datenaustausch.\nEin neues Modell zur effektiveren Anbindung von Ger\u00e4ten ans Internet haben katalanische Wissenschaftler entwickelt. Sie wollen das Internet of Things (IoT) durch bessere Synchronisierung der Verbindungszeiten mit Satelliten unterst\u00fctzen, konkret mit erdnahen Konstellationen wie Starlink, OneWeb und das geplante Kuiper. Aktuell sind gesch\u00e4tzt 15 Milliarden Objekte wie Autos, Bew\u00e4sserungssensoren, Wetterstationen und autonome Drohnen Teil des Internets der Dinge. Bis 2030 soll sich diese Zahl verdoppeln. Eines der Haupthindernisse auf dem Weg dorthin: Viele der Ger\u00e4te stehen an entlegenen Orten ohne Mobilfunk.\nAls beste L\u00f6sung gelten dann Satellitennetzwerke. Doch oft bleiben aufgrund Besonderheiten auf beiden Seiten nur kurze Zeitfenster f\u00fcr den Datenaustausch, sodass ausgefeilte Abstimmung n\u00f6tig ist. Guillem Boquet und Borja Mart\u00ednez von der Wireless-Networks-Gruppe des interdisziplin\u00e4ren Instituts der Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) in Barcelona zeigen in einer jetzt ver\u00f6ffentlichten Studie M\u00f6glichkeiten zu verbesserter Koordination zwischen Objekten auf der Erde und erdnahen Satelliten (LEO f\u00fcr Low Earth Orbit).\nF\u00fcr die Nutzung dieser Trabanten spricht Boquet zufolge viel: \"Sie ben\u00f6tigen weniger Sendeleistung, um eine zuverl\u00e4ssige Kommunikation zu erreichen.\" Das spart Energie, verl\u00e4ngert die Batterielebensdauer und reduziert damit Wartungskosten. Au\u00dferdem sind die Satellitenverbindungen g\u00fcnstiger als andere Anbindungen und bieten bessere Abdeckung.\nIoT-Ger\u00e4te sind in der Regel batteriebetrieben und verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Schlaf- und Aktivit\u00e4tsintervalle, um Energie zu sparen. F\u00fcr diese Arbeitszyklen sind sogar eigene Standards etabliert. Da LEO-Satelliten aber nicht unbedingt ununterbrochene Abdeckung bieten, kommt es den Forschern zufolge zu kleinen, unregelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Kommunikationsfenstern. Entscheidend seien daher \"fortschrittlichere Synchronisierungsstrategien\", um passgenauen und zuverl\u00e4ssigen Zugriff sicherzustellen.\nErfolgreicher Test mit dem Mini-Satelliten Enxanet\nUm die Anspr\u00fcche beider Seiten unter einen Hut zu bringen, ist eine Vorhersage der Verbindungsfenster erforderlich. Die Wissenschaftler haben ein Modell entwickelt, das Satellitenumlaufbahnen ausgehend von einem bekannten Ausgangspunkt berechnet. Dieser Ansatz hat aber seinen Preis: Die Berechnung braucht Energie, ebenso die Aktualisierung der Daten, falls die tats\u00e4chlichen Gegebenheiten abweichen. Ein erster Test der L\u00f6sung in einer realen Kommunikationssituation mit dem Nanosatelliten Enxaneta der katalanischen Regierung ist vielversprechend verlaufen: Die Satellitenzugriffsrate habe sich um bis zu 99 Prozent verbessert, was eine langfristige Netzwerkverbindung gew\u00e4hrleiste, berichten die Forscher. Gleichzeitig sei der Energieverbrauch minimiert worden.\nAls N\u00e4chstes m\u00f6chte das Team die Kosten-Nutzen-Analyse der Implementierung des Modells unter Ber\u00fccksichtigung verschiedener Anwendungen, Dienstnetzwerke, Arten von Satellitenkonstellationen, IoT-Ger\u00e4ten und Kommunikationsverfahren eruieren, dann energiesparende Modi vorschlagen und umsetzen. Mittelfristig soll sich die L\u00f6sung automatisch den Kommunikationsbed\u00fcrfnissen und den sich \u00e4ndernden Bedingungen nicht-terrestrischer Netzwerke anpassen.\n(ds)", "hash": "33bcdab6bd89369ae6dcae0a27b6c2ca4f713693fa2f9c3019239eb5bdfd3dfb", "id": "cb4158a3-0275-45e6-a124-fea4e2cf90a2", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/IoT-So-wollen-Forscher-das-Internet-der-Dinge-per-Satellit-ausweiten-9728917.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-22T21:49:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "a29afd24-428a-49b5-b1ec-8cc00db40081", "title": "IoT: So wollen Forscher das Internet der Dinge per Satellit ausweiten\u200b"}], "tags": {"Barcelona": {"name": "Barcelona", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Boquet": {"name": "Boquet", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Guillem Boquet": {"name": "Guillem Boquet", "tag_type": "PER"}, "UOC": {"name": "UOC", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "IoT: So wollen Forscher das Internet der Dinge per Satellit ausweiten\u200b"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-23T01:24:21.774799", "id": "d12fecf2-2e88-4b6a-af00-e36f7646fca0", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "6"}], "created": "2024-05-22T21:25:00", "id": "f273ba5f-d99a-44f5-8e90-97c53a6418dd", "news_items": [{"author": "BeauHD", "content": "Nvidia Reports a 262% Jump In Sales, 10-1 Stock Split (cnbc.com) 8\nNvidia reported fiscal first-quarter earnings surpassing expectations with strong forecasts, indicating sustained demand for its AI chips. Following the news, the company's stock rose over 6% in extended trading. Nvidia also said it was splitting its stock 10 to 1. CNBC reports: Nvidia said it expected sales of $28 billion in the current quarter. Wall Street was expecting earnings per share of $5.95 on sales of $26.61 billion, according to LSEG. Nvidia reported net income for the quarter of $14.88 billion, or $5.98 per share, compared with $2.04 billion, or 82 cents, in the year-ago period. [...] Nvidia said its data center category rose 427% from the year-ago quarter to $22.6 billion in revenue. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said in a statement that it was due to shipments of the company's \"Hopper\" graphics processors, which include the company's H100 GPU.\nNvidia also highlighted strong sales of its networking parts, which are increasingly important as companies build clusters of tens of thousands of chips that need to be connected. Nvidia said that it had $3.2 billion in networking revenue, primarily its Infiniband products, which was over three times higher than last year's sales. Nvidia, before it became the top supplier to big companies building AI, was known primarily as a company making hardware for 3D gaming. The company's gaming revenue was up 18% during the quarter to $2.65 billion, which Nvidia attributed to strong demand.\nThe company also sells chips for cars and chips for advanced graphics workstations, which remain much smaller than its data center business. The company reported $427 million in professional visualization sales, and $329 million in automotive sales. Nvidia said it bought back $7.7 billion worth of its shares and paid $98 million in dividends during the quarter. Nvidia also said that it's increasing its quarterly cash dividend from 4 cents per share to 10 cents on a pre-split basis. After the split, the dividend will be a penny a share.\nNvidia also highlighted strong sales of its networking parts, which are increasingly important as companies build clusters of tens of thousands of chips that need to be connected.

The report does not say which countries had systems breached or whether they were already aware of the incidents before Bitdefender investigated them.\nThe activity was connected to a previously unknown threat actor, which they named Unfading Sea Haze, but noted that the \u201ctargets and nature of the attacks suggest alignment with Chinese interests.\u201d The primary goal of the campaign, they said, appears to be espionage.\nThe South China Sea is a hotly contested area where China has encroached on territorial claims made by Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan.\nWhile the hackers\u2019 choice of targets related to the disputed area points to Beijing, there are other elements suggesting a connection to China, namely the use of various Gh0st RAT variants \u2014 a tool popular with Chinese actors and used profusely in espionage campaigns by Beijing government hackers.\nBitdefender said it struggled to know how the hackers initially gained entry to some systems because many of the attacks began at least five years ago, but they confirmed at least one method: spearphishing emails.\nThese emails, some of which were sent as recently as May 2023, had malicious documents attached that installed a backdoor onto victim systems, allowing the hackers to return whenever they chose. Once inside, the group used several tools to expand their access to a network and often took over administrator accounts to give them further access.\nThe hackers also deployed several other types of malware to evade detection and collect browser data like passwords.\nA \u2018proxy\u2019 army\nThe Bitdefender research adds to a growing body of knowledge around China\u2019s extensive, nearly decade-long hacking campaign on targets across Southeast Asia and the Pacific.\nAnother report published on Wednesday by Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant highlighted China\u2019s use of stolen and leased proxies, like home office routers, all over the world.\nAccording to Mandiant\u2019s researchers, these networks are a key component of the work of Volt Typhoon \u2013 a Chinese hacking campaign that has targeted critical infrastructure used by the U.S. military.\nMandiant\u2019s research highlighted that the use of compromised systems like small office and home office routers located near a potential victim \u201cbrings a new facet to this issue, as the owners of this equipment may become unwitting enablers of serious spycraft.\u201d\nThe researchers said it was part of a much larger effort by Chinese actors to grow their army of proxies known as \u201cORB networks\u201d \u2014 which stands for operational relay box networks \u2014 for espionage operations.\nORB networks, they said, are akin to botnets and are made up of virtual private servers (VPS), as well as compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart devices, and routers that are often end-of-life or unsupported by their manufacturers.\nMichael Raggi, Mandiant principal analyst and the author of the report, said in a statement that ORB networks are \u201cone of the major innovations in Chinese cyber espionage that are challenging defenders.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re like a maze that is continually reconfiguring with the entrance and the exit disappearing from the maze every 60 - 90 days. In order to target someone, these actors may be coming from a home router right down the street. It\u2019s not unusual for an entirely unwitting person\u2019s home router to be involved in an act of espionage,\u201d he said.\nMandiant Chief Analyst John Hultquist added that Chinese cyber espionage \u201cwas once noisy and easily trackable.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a new type of adversary,\u201d he said.\nJonathan Greig\nis a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

With privileges that almost extend from DC to daylight, one antenna will rarely do everything, and pretty soon your roof starts to get hard to see through the forest of antennas. It may be hell on curb appeal, but what\u2019s a ham to do?\nOne answer could be making one antenna do the work of two, as [Guido] did with this diplexer for dual APRS setups. Automatic Packet Reporting System is a packet radio system used by hams to transmit telemetry and other low-bandwidth digital data. It\u2019s most closely associated with the 2-meter ham band, but [Guido] has both 2-meter (144.8-MHz) and 70-cm LoRa (433.775-MHz) APRS IGates, or Internet gateway receivers. His goal was to use a single broadband discone antenna for both APRS receivers, and this would require sorting the proper signals from the antenna to the proper receiver with a diplexer.\nNote that [Guido] refers to his design as a \u201cduplexer,\u201d which is a device to isolate and protect a receiver from a transmitter when they share the same antenna \u2014 very similar to a diplexer but different. His diplexer is basically a pair of filters in parallel \u2014 a high-pass filter tuned to just below the 70-cm band, and a low-pass filter tuned just above the top of the 2-m band. The filters were designed using a handy online tool and simulated in LTSpice, and then constructed in classic \u201cugly\u201d style. The diplexer is all-passive and uses air-core inductors, all hand-wound and tweaked by adjusting the spacing of the turns.\n[Guido]\u2019s diplexer performs quite well \u2014 only a fraction of a dB of insertion loss, but 45 to 50 dB attenuation of unwanted frequencies \u2014 pretty impressive for a box full of caps and coils. We love these quick and dirty tactical builds, and it\u2019s always a treat to see RF wizardry in action.\n7 thoughts on \u201cPassive Diplexer Makes One Antenna Act Like Two\u201d\nCan somebody explain what the following means: \u201cWith privileges that almost extend from DC to daylight,\u201d\nDirect Current to daylight, as in 0 Hz to 400THz?\nIt\u2019s a common/more colorful way to say \u201cacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum\u201d.\nThe funny thing is that \u201cDC to daylight radios\u201d are typically kHz to low-GHz, and amateur radio rights actually go well *past* that.\nHm. Morse telegraphy over wire would use DC..\nBut user \u2018Somewhat Anonymous\u2019 has a better explanation, maybe.\nGot it. Thanks for the replies.\nUS hams have privileges on different bands from 130 kHz to 250 GHz plus everything above 300 GHz. So pretty wide ranging.\nAC1QW\nWhat I like about this is that it might keep \u201colder\u201d modes alive, such as the original APRS via Packet-Radio.\nBecause if hams have to choose, they\u2019ll likely fall for the latest hype and go for something such as LoRa.\nI experience this in my home town nearly every day.\nPeople on local repeater are interested in the latest tech (Win10, FT8, DMR/C4FM), no matter if the previous one has certain advantages sometimes, still.\nSo I\u2019m really grateful for things like this.\nIt\u2019s always good if certain things can co-exist, so diversity is being preserved. \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

The extortionists have demanded $25 million by Thursday, and threatened to leak the stolen data if the pharmacy chain doesn't pay up.\nWhile London Drugs didn't answer The Register's specific questions about the intrusion, including whether its execs had offered to pay $8 million, its statement said: \"London Drugs is unwilling and unable to pay ransom to these cybercriminals.\"\nTIt did note that it is \"aware that London Drugs has been identified by cybercriminals on the Dark Web as a victim of exfiltration of files from its corporate head office, some of which may contain employee information,\" and that the crooks may publish the stolen data.\nLondon Drugs closes all of its pharmacies following 'cybersecurity incident'\n-\nBritish Library's candid ransomware comms driven by 'emotional intelligence'\n-\nFirst LockBit, now BreachForums: Are cops winning the war or just a few battles?\n-\nLockBit dethroned as leading ransomware gang for first time post-takedown\n-\nWhile the company has notified all current employees, and will provide them two years of free credit monitoring and identity-theft protection, it hasn't yet determined how much or what specific personal information was compromised.\n\"Our review is underway, but due to and the extent of system damage caused by this cyber incident, we expect this review will take some time to perform,\" the statement said, adding that after the review has been completed, it will contact employees directly to alert them about what, if any, personal details were stolen.\nLockBit's claims come about three months after law enforcement disrupted the gang's infrastructure, and later unmasked the crew's kingpin. And despite the London Drugs infection, there are indications that the UK National Crime Agency-led operation is putting a small dent in the criminals' illicit endeavors.\nAccording to research published on Wednesday by NCC Group, the gang didn't register the most number of attacks across a single month for the first time since the February takedown.

Die nicht gestellte Parkuhr kann aber auch abseits der Stellfl\u00e4chen im \u00f6ffentlichen Raum teuer werden. Seit einigen Jahren kann das Parken ohne Parkscheibe auch auf Parkpl\u00e4tzen von Baum\u00e4rkten, Schnellrestaurants und Superm\u00e4rkten viel Geld kosten. Immer h\u00e4ufiger werden solche privaten Stellfl\u00e4chen \u00fcberwacht. F\u00fcr Abhilfe sorgen elektronische Parkscheiben, welche die Parkzeit automatisch anzeigen. Dabei ist solch eine elektronische Parkuhr mit Preisen ab 20 Euro meistens g\u00fcnstiger als ein Strafzettel.\nDie Funktionsweise von elektronischen oder auch digitalen Parkscheiben ist denkbar einfach: Die Ger\u00e4te klebt man von innen an die Windschutzscheibe des PKW. Ein integrierter Bewegungssensor registriert, ob das Auto f\u00e4hrt oder steht. Beim Parken stellt sich die Uhrzeit automatisch auf die n\u00e4chste halbe Stunde und stoppt. Eine Nachtparkfunktion erlaubt das manuelle Einstellen der Ankunftszeit. Das ist etwa dann praktisch, wenn man abends das Auto abstellt und erst ab den Morgenstunden eine Parkscheiben-Pflicht besteht.\nRechtliche Grundvoraussetzungen\nSoll eine elektronische Parkscheibe eine herk\u00f6mmliche Variante abl\u00f6sen, muss sie der StVO-Zulassung entsprechen und eine ganze Reihe an Voraussetzungen erf\u00fcllen. Trifft nur eines dieser Merkmale nicht zu, ist eine Verwendung im Stra\u00dfenverkehr nicht zul\u00e4ssig und die Verwendung sch\u00fctzt dementsprechend nicht vor einer Strafe. Vor dem Kauf sollte man die digitale Parkscheibe auf folgende Punkte pr\u00fcfen:\nAuf der Vorderseite muss das P (wei\u00dfe Schrift auf blauem Grund; Verkehrszeichen 314) aufgedruckt sein.\n-\nDas Wort Ankunftszeit muss vorhanden sein.\n-\nNach dem Ausschalten des Motors/Abstellen des Fahrzeugs darf die Parkscheibe ihre Einstellungen nicht mehr \u00e4ndern.\n-\nDie Uhrzeit muss im 24-Stunden-Format dargestellt sein.\n-\nDie Zeit muss gut ablesbar sein.\n-\nDie Anzeige muss mindestens 2 cm hoch sein.\n-\nEs muss eine Typengenehmigung vorliegen (ECE-Genehmigung vom Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt).\n-\nDie in dieser Bestenliste gezeigten Parkscheiben haben w\u00e4hrend der Tests zuverl\u00e4ssig funktioniert und sind zum Teil im Bekannten- und Freundeskreis seit Jahren im Einsatz. Sie sind allesamt f\u00fcr die Nutzung im Stra\u00dfenverkehr zugelassen. Au\u00dfer den bisher von uns getesteten Varianten sind uns aktuell keine weiteren Modelle mit Zulassung bekannt.\nNeben den erlaubten Parkscheiben gibt es eine Menge Varianten ohne Zulassung. Ein anschauliches Beispiel daf\u00fcr sind automatisch mitlaufende Modelle. Diese sehen auf den ersten Blick aus, wie klassische Parkscheiben, haben aber ein Uhrwerk auf der R\u00fcckseite verbaut. Der Nutzer muss bei Ankunft lediglich einen kleinen Hebel umlegen und die aktuelle Uhrzeit ist vollautomatisch eingestellt. Eigentlich sehr bequem, aber nicht erlaubt. Wer ein solches Modell mit Elektronik einsetzt, kann die Parkscheibe auch gleich weglassen.\nEbenso unzul\u00e4ssig sind herk\u00f6mmliche Varianten ohne Verkehrszeichen 314. Einige Verk\u00e4ufer weisen immerhin darauf hin, dass es sich um einen Scherzartikel handelt und keine Zulassung f\u00fcr den Stra\u00dfenverkehr vorhanden ist. Insbesondere bei kleinen H\u00e4ndlern fehlt dieser Hinweis h\u00e4ufig.\nEinige auf den ersten Blick legal erscheinenden Modelle, wie die auf diversen Schn\u00e4ppchenseiten angepriesene Bmot Auto Parkuhr mit integriertem Solarpanel, erf\u00fcllen zwar einen Teil der Anforderungen, die Nutzung bleibt trotzdem unzul\u00e4ssig.\nBilderstrecke - elektronische Parkuhren mit Zulassung\nElektronische Parkuhren mit Zulassung.\nPlatz 1: Needit Park Lite Solar\nDie Needit Park Lite Solar ist knapp unser Testsieger. Einen Sonderpunkt f\u00fcr Nachhaltigkeit gibt es nicht allein f\u00fcr die ganz aus Papier hergestellte Verpackung. Die durchschnittlich gro\u00dfe Parkuhr verf\u00fcgt neben allen rechtlichen Voraussetzungen als einziges Modell \u00fcber eine hybride Stromversorgung mit zus\u00e4tzlicher Solarzelle. So erreicht die integrierte Knopfzelle (Typ CR2477) hier theoretisch eine Batterielaufzeit von sechs Jahren und mehr. Damit das funktioniert, m\u00fcsste die Parkuhr allerdings jeden Tag m\u00f6glichst lange Sonnenschein abbekommen, was in der Praxis unwahrscheinlich ist. Trotzdem sollte das Mini-PV-Modul die Lebensdauer im Alltagsbetrieb erheblich verl\u00e4ngern.\nNeben den rechtlichen Voraussetzungen gibt es ein gut ablesbares Zweit-Display auf der R\u00fcckseite, einen Batteriealarm, eine manuelle Zeiteinstellung sowie die M\u00f6glichkeit auf verschiedene Zeit-Modi umzustellen. Die in etwa Deutschland, Schweden und Finnland g\u00fcltige 30-Minuten-Rundung ist nicht \u00fcberall zul\u00e4ssig. In D\u00e4nemark und \u00d6sterreich wird nur auf eine Viertelstunde gerundet.\nDa kein Wechselrahmen zum Einsatz kommt, darf die Parkuhr f\u00fcr den Batteriewechsel nicht zu knapp \u00fcber dem Armaturenbrett an der Frontscheibe angeklebt werden. Aktuell kostet das Ger\u00e4t in Blau (Preisvergleich) oder in Schwarz (Preisvergleich) knapp 35 Euro, was wir hinsichtlich Ausstattung und Nachhaltigkeit fair finden. Der Preis von knapp 30 bis 35 Euro ist zwar gerechtfertigt, aber hinsichtlich der Konkurrenz nicht g\u00fcnstig.\nPlatz 2: Auto XS Parkzeituhr von Aldi/ DNT Parkscreen\nUnser Preis-Leistungs-Sieger ist die automatische Parkzeituhr von Auto XS. Die von Aldi angebotene Parkuhr schneidet nicht nur in der Praxis hervorragend ab, sie war mit einem Preis von nur 20 Euro auch eines der g\u00fcnstigsten Modelle mit Zulassung. Aktuell ist sie bei Aldi aber vergriffen. Bei der Suche nach neuen Modellen sind wir k\u00fcrzlich \u00fcber die Parkscheibe Parkscreen von DNT gestolpert, die der Parkzeituhr von Aldi zum Verwechseln \u00e4hnlich sieht. Der Blick auf die Zulassungsnummer verr\u00e4t: Hierbei handelt es sich tats\u00e4chlich um ein identisches Produkt, welches lediglich unter verschiedenen Labels und mit abweichender Verpackung verkauft wird. Die Variante Parkscreen ist aktuell ab etwa 25 Euro (Preisvergleich) erh\u00e4ltlich und damit 5 Euro teurer als das Angebot von Aldi.\nIm Praxistest dauert es bei dieser Parkuhr nur etwa 15 Sekunden, bis die Parkzeit automatisch eingeblendet wird. Ein kleines Manko ist uns hier dann aber trotzdem noch aufgefallen. Bei der Variante von Aldi fehlt eine manuelle Einstellung der Parkzeit. In der Praxis wird die Funktion zwar nicht h\u00e4ufig genutzt, sie kann in seltenen F\u00e4llen aber sinnvoll sein.\nDie elektronische Parkscheibe besteht aus einem schwarzen Kunststoffgeh\u00e4use mit einem blauen umlaufenden Rand und dem dunklen Haupt-Display auf der Vorderseite. Die Uhrzeit in hellen Ziffern auf dunklem Grund ist auch bei starkem Sonnenschein gut zu erkennen. Das Zweit-Display, die drei Bedientaster und das Batteriefach f\u00fcr die Knopfzelle sitzen auf der R\u00fcckseite. Die Einstellung von Uhrzeit und Datum klappt auch ohne die beigelegte Anleitung problemlos.\nAuf einen Wechselrahmen verzichtet der Hersteller. Das ist aber unproblematisch, da sich Betriebszustand, Batteriewarnung und aktuelle Uhrzeit jederzeit im ausreichend gro\u00dfen Zweit-Display auf der R\u00fcckseite \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen lassen. Auch die Batterie (Typ CR2450) kann im aufgeklebten Zustand ausgetauscht werden, wenn die Position an der Windschutzscheibe entsprechend gew\u00e4hlt wurde.\nPlatz 3: Ooono P-Disc No2\nDie neue elektronische Parkuhr von Ooono, die P-Disc No2, landet auf dem dritten Platz. Zum Preis von 30 bis 35 Euro (Preisvergleich) gibt es hier eine richtig schicke runde Parkscheibe mit gro\u00dfer Zeitanzeige und zuverl\u00e4ssiger Funktion. Die schwarze Schrift auf hellen Grund ist kontrastreich und gut ablesbar.\nDamit man an die auswechselbaren Knopfzellen (Typ CR2450) gut herankommt, wird die Parkscheibe per zweier magnetischer Halterungen an der Frontscheibe befestigt. Zum Austausch wird die R\u00fcckseite einfach abgenommen. Die Batterielaufzeit betr\u00e4gt laut Hersteller bis zu zwei Jahre. Ist die Batterie leer, warnt die P-Disc No2 mit einem Piepton.\nIm Vergleich zu anderen Parkuhren ist diese aufgrund des schwarzen Geh\u00e4uses verh\u00e4ltnism\u00e4\u00dfig unauff\u00e4llig. Zulassungsnummer, P-Zeichen und das Wort Ankunftszeit sind aber nat\u00fcrlich vorhanden und die Parkuhr somit zul\u00e4ssig.\nPlatz 4: Achilles Parkw\u00e4chter\nDen vierten Platz unserer Bestenliste belegt der Achilles Parkw\u00e4chter f\u00fcr etwa 35 Euro (Preisvergleich). Das Modell ist sehr kompakt, gut verarbeitet und in den Farben Blau und Schwarz erh\u00e4ltlich. Der Parkw\u00e4chter verzichtet zwar auf ein Zweit-Display auf der R\u00fcckseite, daf\u00fcr ist er dank Magnethalterung jederzeit bequem abnehmbar, um etwa die Batterie zu tauschen. Geht diese zuneige, warnt das Ger\u00e4t den Nutzer.\nDie Magnethalterungen sind auch einzeln erh\u00e4ltlich und so kann man die Parkscheibe bequem in unterschiedlichen Fahrzeugen verwenden. Die Batterie (Typ CR2450) h\u00e4lt eineinhalb bis zwei Jahre.\nPlatz 5: Needit Park Micro\nDie blau-wei\u00dfe Needit Park Micro, auch unter der Bezeichnung Zentec Park Mini 3014 erh\u00e4ltlich, ist eine der kleinsten elektrischen Parkscheiben mit offizieller Zulassung in dieser Bestenliste und belegt den f\u00fcnften Platz. Grund hierf\u00fcr sind die sehr unaufdringliche Batteriewarnung und die Tatsache, dass die Uhr nur in Blau erh\u00e4ltlich ist. Ansonsten ist die Ausstattung identisch zum Modell Parkw\u00e4chter. Der Wechselrahmen ist auch hier einzeln erh\u00e4ltlich.\nDiese Parkuhr nutzen wir auch privat. Nach knapp 2,5 Jahren musste die Batterie (Typ CR-2032) zum ersten Mal gewechselt werden. Die Klebehalterung h\u00e4lt auch nach hei\u00dfen Sommern und kalten Wintern zuverl\u00e4ssig. Ob nun schwarze Schrift auf hellem Hintergrund besser ist als umgekehrt, bleibt letztlich Geschmackssache. Die Needit Park Micro ist inklusive Versand ab 20 Euro (Preisvergleich) erh\u00e4ltlich.\nPlatz 6: Needit Park Mini\nDie in Blau und Schwarz erh\u00e4ltliche Park Mini von Needit ist der Park Micro sehr \u00e4hnlich und mit Preisen ab 25 Euro (Preisvergleich) zudem erschwinglich. Hauptunterschiede sind das zus\u00e4tzliche Zweit-Display auf der R\u00fcckseite und der fehlende Wechselrahmen.\nStatt mit schwarzer Schrift auf hellem Untergrund zeigt die Park Mini die Uhrzeit in heller Farbe auf dunklem Grund. Auch hier gilt: Die Positionierung an der Windschutzscheibe muss gut \u00fcberlegt sein, da Bedienung und Batteriewechsel sonst schwerfallen. Die Knopfzelle (Typ CR2450) h\u00e4lt zweieinhalb bis drei Jahre.\nPlatz 7: Ooono Park\nDie runde Ooono Park mit einem Durchmesser von 60 mm war mit urspr\u00fcnglich knapp 50 Euro eine zugegebenerma\u00dfen teure, aber sehr kompakte digitale Parkscheibe. Aktuell listen sie H\u00e4ndler wie Amazon schon f\u00fcr 20 Euro, was wir als sehr fair erachten und mit einem h\u00f6heren Ranking als in der Vergangenheit belohnen. Die Vorderseite aus Aluminium sieht schick aus und so wirkt die automatische Parkscheibe deutlich hochwertiger als die anderen Modelle, die alle g\u00e4nzlich aus Kunststoff bestehen.\nDer Batteriewechsel ist hier kein Problem, die magnetische Halterung macht im Test einen guten und zuverl\u00e4ssigen Job. Vor der Montage muss die Scheibe aber unbedingt ordentlich gereinigt werden. Im direkten Vergleich zu den vorher platzierten Ger\u00e4ten reagiert der Sensor f\u00fcr Bewegungen deutlich weniger empfindlich. Ein kurzes Umparken reicht hier oft nicht aus. Der Hersteller spricht von bis zu zwei Minuten Fahrzeit, bevor sich die Uhr wieder verstellt. Die Batterie (Typ CR2450) h\u00e4lt knapp zwei Jahre.\nPlatz 8: Parkscheibe von Aldi, Michelin, Pearl und Technaxx\nDen siebten Platz belegt eine automatische Parkuhr, die unter verschiedenen Namen und in verschiedenen Farben verkauft wird \u2013 aktuell aber meistens vergriffen ist. Dass es sich um ein und dasselbe Produkt handelt, zeigt der Blick auf die Zulassungsnummer.\nIm Aldi-Onlineshop hei\u00dft das Modell Parkuhr EP-1 und kostet 20 Euro. Technaxx nennt seine Variante Parkscheibe TX-272 und verlangt rund 25 Euro. Der Versandh\u00e4ndler Pearl nutzt den Namen Lescars-Parkscheibe und verlangt rund 23 Euro. Mit dem Label des Reifenherstellers Michelin kostet die Parkuhr rund 25 Euro.\nGut gefallen uns das Zweit-Display auf der R\u00fcckseite und die M\u00f6glichkeit, die Zeitrundung zu ver\u00e4ndern. Auch ein Nachtparkmodus ist vorhanden. Zum Wechsel der Batterie (Typ CR2450) sollte diese Parkuhr nicht zu knapp \u00fcber dem Armaturenbrett verklebt werden.\nPlatz 9: Needit Park Lite\nWenn die Abmessungen keine Rolle spielen, kommt auch die achtplatzierte elektrische Parkscheibe, die Needit Park Lite infrage. Diese gibt es in Blau und Schwarz und sowohl mit heller als auch mit dunkler Schrift. Leider ist die Batteriewarnung auch hier eher unauff\u00e4llig. Der Preis von knapp 22 Euro ist angemessen und fair.\nHier gilt ebenfalls wieder: Die Positionierung an der Windschutzscheibe muss gut \u00fcberlegt sein, da Bedienung und Batteriewechsel sonst schwerfallen. Die Lebensdauer der Batterie (Typ CR2450) erreicht hier erfahrungsgem\u00e4\u00df zwischen eineinhalb und zweieinhalb Jahren. Die Parkscheibe Park Lite ist in den Farben Schwarz und Blau erh\u00e4ltlich.\nPlatz 10: Achilles Parkw\u00e4chter V1\nDer Achilles Parkw\u00e4chter V1 geh\u00f6rt zu den neueren Modellen in unserer Bestenliste. Die V1 ist zwar deutlich gr\u00f6\u00dfer als die bisher privat genutzte Park Mini, sie bietet allerdings eine sehr komfortable Bedienung dank gro\u00dfer Bedienelemente und ebenfalls einen praktischen Wechselrahmen. So kann etwa das automatische Zeitintervall schnell und einfach auf eine andere Rundungsdauer eingestellt werden. Auch das manuelle Einstellen der Parkzeit geht problemlos und einfach von der Hand.\nUnerfreulicherweise kann uns die digitale Parkuhr im Praxistest nicht voll \u00fcberzeugen. Statt direkt auf die Scheibe, wird der Rahmen der recht klobigen Parkuhr auf einer bunten Folie befestigt, die von innen auf der Windschutzscheibe aufgebracht wird. Da alle f\u00fcr die Nutzung ben\u00f6tigten Aufdrucke auf dieser Folie aufgebracht sind, ist auch nur diese Art der Anbringung zul\u00e4ssig. Abgesehen vom gr\u00f6\u00dferen Installations-Aufwand und der wenig hochwertigen Optik, k\u00f6nnte das trotz einer zweiten zum Lieferumfang geh\u00f6rigen Folie, etwa beim Fahrzeugwechsel, zum Problem werden. Als Batterie dient eine Knopfzelle (Typ CR2450).\nWer \u00fcber die gro\u00dfe Bauweise und den Preis von immerhin 35 Euro hinwegsehen kann, bekommt im Gegenzug die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Farbauswahl. F\u00fcr die legale Nutzung spielt die Grundfarbe der Folie keine Rolle, da das P-Symbol in zugelassenen Blauton abgebildet ist.\nAlternative: Jacob Jensen Parkscheibe II\nDie Jacob Jensen war mit einem regul\u00e4ren Preis ab 50 Euro immer teurer als die Mitbewerber. Aktuell ist der Preis sogar auf satte 74 Euro gestiegen, was wir als deutlich zu teuer erachten. Die runde digitale Parkscheibe hat einen Durchmesser von knapp 100 mm. Geh\u00e4use und Display sind in gl\u00e4nzendem Schwarz gehalten. Die Uhrzeit wird hell dargestellt. Auch hier ist der Bewegungssensor vergleichsweise wenig empfindlich und reagiert erst nach knapp einer Minute Fahrt. Zur Stromversorgung dient eine Knopfzelle des Typs CR2450.\nBatteriewechsel oder \u00c4nderungen am Setting funktionieren dank Klemmhalterung und vern\u00fcnftigen Drucktasten problemlos. Das Designer-St\u00fcck wirkt trotz ordentlicher Verarbeitung nicht hochwertiger als etwa die ebenfalls runde Variante Oono Park, welche allerdings schon f\u00fcr deutlich weniger Geld erh\u00e4ltlich ist. Im Vergleich zu den Modellen Park Micro, Parc Mini und Park Lite ist die Uhr von Jacob Jansen deutlich teurer, ohne dabei einen Mehrwert zu bieten.\nFazit\nMit Preisen zwischen 20 und 35 Euro sind die meisten elektronischen Parkscheiben g\u00fcnstiger als ein Ticket wegen einer vergessenen Parkscheibe. Der Kauf lohnt sich aber und hat uns in den vergangenen Jahren schon regelm\u00e4\u00dfig vor \u00e4rgerlichen Strafzetteln bewahrt.\nZwar sind auch die teuren digitalen Varianten gut, im Hinblick auf das Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis k\u00f6nnen sie den g\u00fcnstigen Modellen aber nicht das Wasser reichen. Die Parkscheibe von Ooono ist mittlerweile auf unter 30 Euro gefallen. Die aktuell mehr als 70 Euro f\u00fcr die Parkuhr von Jacob Jensen empfinden wir als viel zu teuer.\nEine Batteriewarnung ist aus unserer Sicht sinnvoll, da die Batterielaufzeit derart lang ist, dass man gar nicht mehr daran denkt. Fest verklebte Parkscheiben, wie unser Testsieger von Aldi, m\u00fcssen so positioniert werden, dass man Tasten und Batteriefach erreichen kann. Einfacher und bequemer ist die Nutzung einer Parkscheibe mit Wechselrahmen, wie Needit Park Micro, Park NO1 von Ooono und Achilles Parkw\u00e4chter V1.\nIn der Themenwelt Auto zeigen wir weitere praktische Gadgets f\u00fcr den PKW.

These rules require covered companies to immediately notify the SEC of any SCI incidents, and provide a detailed report within 24 hours.\nThat is the complete opposite of what the SEC alleges actually happened.\nThe agency claims that instead, after being notified that it may be subject to a VPN zero day and then discovering it had already been attacked using the vulnerability, ICE told no one. According to the SEC's claims, ICE took the VPN offline, dissected it and waited days to notify anyone outside its infosec team that the company and its subsidiaries may have been compromised.\n\"Five days after being notified of the vulnerability \u2026 having uncovered no evidence of an established unauthorized VPN session or penetration of the ICE network environment, ICE InfoSec personnel determined that the threat actor's access was limited to the compromised VPN device,\" the SEC alleged in court documents.\n\"It was only at this point \u2026 that the ICE SCI Respondents' legal and compliance personnel were finally notified of the Intrusion,\" the SEC added. \"And it was only at this point that the ICE SCI Respondents determined that the Intrusion was a de minimis event,\" and thus not covered by immediate reporting requirements.\nAu contraire, the SEC claimed: ICE \"had a reasonable basis to conclude that unauthorized entry \u2026 had occurred, triggering [SCI] immediate notification requirements to the SEC.\"\nD-Wave hello to another quantum pioneer warned over possible delisting\n-\nDisaster recovery blunder broke New York Stock Exchange this week\n-\nRaspberry Pi sets IPO jam for June\n-\nSEC staffers slammed for serious security snafus\n-\nSEC division of enforcement director Gurbir Grewal said the vast financial power ICE and its subsidiaries play in global financial markets make it critical that it and similar firms strictly conform to the rules. Grewal said ICE's de minimis claim is irrelevant since it can't make that determination immediately, and said it should have reported the issue as soon as it was aware.\n\"Rather, it was Commission staff that contacted the respondents in the process of assessing reports of similar cyber vulnerabilities,\" Grewal said. \"When it comes to cybersecurity, especially events at critical market intermediaries, every second counts and four days can be an eternity.\"\nThe settlement includes no admission of guilt on the part of ICE, NYSE or any of the other eighty entities, and includes a promise to do better next time. The SEC said it took prior SCI violations involving failure to implement proper backup and recovery capabilities by NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American and Archipelago Trading Services into account when deciding its penalty.\nRegardless, it still arrived at a $10 million fine, which all ten firms involved agreed to. No shock there \u2013 the fine amounts to less than one percent of ICE's Q1 2024 revenue. \u00ae", "hash": "7699bda18f308bbde0715908970cf5a57874748cc8f7117c47fc1e3b04869f5a", "id": "3b26620b-dadc-4a75-b72f-c53d4aff195e", "link": "https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2024/05/22/nyse_parent_gets_10m_wrist/", "osint_source_id": "a94d3f15-5689-470c-9d1f-670b8c63491d", "published": "2024-05-22T19:30:13", "source": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/headlines.atom", "story_id": "ef7271ff-0907-4968-b7c1-0767c289793a", "title": "NYSE parent gets $10M wrist tap for failing to report 2021 systems break-in"}], "tags": {"Archipelago": {"name": "Archipelago", "tag_type": "APT"}, "Commission": {"name": "Commission", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Grewal": {"name": "Grewal", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Gurbir Grewal": {"name": "Gurbir Grewal", "tag_type": "PER"}, "ICE": {"name": "ICE", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Intercontinental Exchange": {"name": "Intercontinental Exchange", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "NYSE": {"name": "NYSE", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "NYSE American": {"name": "NYSE American", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "NYSE Arca": {"name": "NYSE Arca", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Raspberry Pi": {"name": "Raspberry Pi", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "SCI": {"name": "SCI", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "SEC": {"name": "SEC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Securities and Exchange Commission": {"name": "Securities and Exchange Commission", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "VPN": {"name": "VPN", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "NYSE parent gets $10M wrist tap for failing to report 2021 systems break-in"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-23T01:17:14.446450", "id": "bfdacbce-cbf2-4c84-b81e-1b2bad5dfbbb", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "12"}], "created": "2024-05-22T19:27:00", "id": "06afb6de-0e56-4e9c-8391-171979347517", "news_items": [{"author": "Maria Diaz", "content": "'ZDNET Recommends': What exactly does it mean?\nZDNET's recommendations are based on many hours of testing, research, and comparison shopping.

However, reports of AirTags being used to track people without their consent cast a shadow on their use and application.\nAlso: The best AirTag for your wallet is flat, rechargeable, and isn't made by Apple\nThis is why Apple made significant changes to what and how AirTags can be used. Apple began giving disclosures to AirTag owners, reiterating that these trackers are only for tracking their belongings and never for unwanted tracking of others. The company then added the ability for iPhone users to see when an AirTag has been detected to be moving with them. Both iOS and Android devices now alert their owners when an unknown Bluetooth tracker is found moving with them.\nHow to know if an AirTag is tracking you\nWhat you'll need: An iPhone or an Android phone. We'll detail what it looks like on an iPhone when an AirTag tracks you.\nIf you suspect someone is tracking your movements using an AirTag, your iOS or Android phone may alert you before you have to do anything. If someone is tracking you without permission and you feel you may be in danger, contact law enforcement to get more information on the AirTag's owner from Apple.\nAlso: How to clear the cache on your iPhone\n1. You may receive an alert on your iPhone\nIf you own an iPhone and it detects and AirTag, your phone may alert you of an \"AirTag found moving with you.\" This will happen if these things are true:\nThe AirTag is separated from its owner.\nYour iPhone is awake.\nThis can also happen with other Find My Network accessories, like AirPods, AirPods Pro, AirPods Max, and others. AirTags, second-generation AirPods Pro, and other Find My items can all play a sound when they're moved while separated from their owners.\n2. Check that your Tracking Notifications are on\nIf you don't receive an alert of an unknown AirTag nearby when you know there is one, you may need to follow these steps to ensure your tracking notifications are turned on:\nGo to Settings and select Privacy & Security.\n-\nTap on Location Services and turn on Location Services.\n-\nGo to System Services.\n-\nTurn on both Find My iPhone and Significant Locations.\n-\nGo back to Settings and select Bluetooth.\n-\nTurn on Bluetooth.\n-\nFinally, go to the Find My app and tap on yourself, the Me tab.\n-\nTurn on Tracking Notifications.\n-\nMake sure Airplane Mode is off, or you won't get notifications.\n-\n3. Check the Find My app\nWhen an AirTag is separated from its owner, it may play a sound when moved to make it easier for others to find it. If you hear an AirTag -- or another sound you can't recognize that you believe could be an AirTag -- you can open the Find My app on your Apple device. Then check the app to see if an AirTag is found.\nAlso: The best Bluetooth trackers you can buy\nCheck your belongings for the hidden AirTag, making sure to pat down jackets and bags, and thoroughly check your pockets, purse, and wallet.\n4. Play a sound on AirTag\nIf you're checking the Find My app after being alerted that an AirTag is traveling with you, you can tap \"Play Sound\" on the device to find it more easily.\nSimilar to how you would track your own AirTag, you can go to the Find My app by tapping on the alert on your iPhone, tapping \"Continue\", and then \"Find Nearby\". Move around your space, following the steps on the screen.\nAlso: The best GPS trackers for kids\nThe \"Play a Sound\" option is only available to you if the AirTag owner isn't nearby and their Apple device isn't within range. The precision finding feature is only available on iPhone 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 models with ultra-wideband technology.\nIf you can't play a sound from the Find My app, there's a good possibility that the unknown AirTag isn't with you anymore and your iPhone can't find it nearby.\n5. If you find an AirTag that doesn't belong to you, check its information\nOnce you have eyes on the AirTag that doesn't belong to you, you can use your iPhone or any other NFC-enabled smartphone to see the AirTag information. Just hold the top of your phone near the white side of the found AirTag and wait for it to recognize it.\nAlso: How I created my own Apple AirTag with a Flipper Zero\nA notification will appear when the NFC is scanned. You can tap on that notification to access a website with the AirTag's serial number and the last four digits of the owner's phone number.\nIf this is a lost AirTag, the owner might have added their contact information to let the finder contact them.\n6. Disable the AirTag\nDisabling an AirTag will make it so the owner can't see its current location or get updates for it.\nTo disable the AirTag, you only need to remove the battery. You can do this by pushing down and twisting the cover counterclockwise to open the AirTag and then taking out the battery.\nIf you're concerned about unwanted tracking or fear for your safety, take screenshots throughout this process, including the device's serial number and owner's information, contact local law enforcement, and give the disabled AirTag to authorities.\nFAQs\nHow to find out if an AirTag is tracking me on Android?\nAn unknown AirTag can move with you and send tracking data to the owner regardless of whether you have an iPhone or Android phone.\nIf you are an Android user, Google added 'unknown tracker alerts' for Android 6.0 and newer users. So, if an AirTag is tracking you, your Android phone should let you know without having to install a separate Android app from the Google Play Store. This feature is available for Apple tracking devices and other Bluetooth trackers.\nAlso: The best AirTag accessories\nIf your Android smartphone detects an AirTag moving with you that has been separated from its owner, it will let you scan for the tracker and play a sound from it to find it -- all without ever letting the owner know it's been found.\nDo AirTags have GPS?\nAn AirTag doesn't have GPS. Instead, it uses the Find My network of almost two billion iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs. It sends an anonymous Bluetooth signal that can be picked up by any one of these devices within 30 feet. Then, these devices will send the AirTag's location to iCloud, allowing users to see it in their own Find My app.\nAlso: The best AirTag wallets\nBecause there are so many Apple devices located worldwide, Apple's Find My network has grown to be very reliable. Each Apple device is a node that grows the network, so a lost AirTag can transmit an accurate location without GPS if it's near an iPhone or other Find My network device.\nHow do I stop an Apple AirTag from tracking me?\nThe easiest way to stop an AirTrack from tracking you is to remove its battery. This will disable the AirTag, and its owner won't be able to see any additional tracking information.\nAlso: This accessory lets you add an AirTag to your Apple TV remote\nThe Find My network connects different iPhones and Apple devices to AirTags, to track their location.

If they support her idea, the agency will formally begin proceedings to study making the change.\nThe proposal comes on the heels of an AI-generated wave of robocalls mimicking President Joe Biden\u2019s voice and telling voters not to turn out in the New Hampshire primary in January. In February, the FCC announced it would make AI-generated voice cloning in robocalls illegal.\nAI also has been used extensively in political campaigns bombarding Indians turning out for the country\u2019s elections, which end June 1. Politicians there have used AI to create propaganda, crude audio fakes and AI-generated satire.\nIf the other FCC commissioners agree with the proposal, the agency will first ask the public for input on whether broadcasters should be required to make on-air and written disclosures when political candidates and groups use AI to make ads. It also will seek public comment on how to define AI-generated content.\nRosenworcel is proposing that both candidate and issue advertisements be subject to the rule and wants the new requirements to apply to a wide range of entities in the broadcasting ecosystem, including cable operators, satellite TV and radio providers. The proposal also would apply to section 325(c) permittees, or those sending programming to foreign stations.\n\u201cAs artificial intelligence tools become more accessible, the Commission wants to make sure consumers are fully informed when the technology is used,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a statement emailed to reporters.\nAI is anticipated to play a major role in the design of political ads in the 2024 cycle and could deceive voters, experts say, particularly if so-called deepfakes are deployed.\nDeepfakes are images, video and audio recordings that trick audiences into believing people have said or done something that they did not.\nIn making her announcement, Rosenworcel said the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act gives the FCC the authority to regulate political advertising.\nSuzanne Smalley\nis a reporter covering privacy, disinformation and cybersecurity policy for The Record.

Diese hat 6 Raketen an Bord, die alle gleichzeitig abgefeuert werden.\nSea Baby: Erst Kamikaze, dann Raketenwerfer\nDie Basis f\u00fcr die raketenschie\u00dfende Drohne ist Sea Baby. Dabei handelt es sich um das Drohnenboot, das seit Juli 2022 eingesetzt und konstant weiterentwickelt wird. Bisher wurde es prim\u00e4r zur Aufkl\u00e4rung und als Kamikazedrohne genutzt. Dazu ist Sea Baby mit bis zu 850 Kilogramm schweren Gefechtsk\u00f6pfen ausgestattet.\nIm J\u00e4nner 2024 tauchte erstmals ein Sea Baby auf, das mit Raketenwerfern ausgestattet war. Bis zu 6 RPV-16 sind am Heck montiert. Dabei handelt es sich um in der Ukraine hergestellte Infanterieraketenwerfer mit Aerosolladungen.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Ukraine stattet Kamikaze-Boote mit Aerosolbomben aus\nSea Baby mit RPV-16\n6 Bilder\nBei Aerosolladungen wird zus\u00e4tzlich zur Sprengladung ein Brennstoff ist der Luft verteilt. Im Gegensatz zu herk\u00f6mmlichen Bomben h\u00e4lt die Druckwirkung l\u00e4nger, die Hitzeentwicklung ist h\u00f6her und durch das Eindringen des Brennstoffs in Bunker und H\u00e4user, k\u00f6nnen sie effektiv gegen befestige Ziele genutzt werden. Zudem entsteht nach der Druckwelle eine Vakuumwirkung. Dieser Unterdruck erzeugt bei Menschen im Umkreis h\u00e4ufig Lungensch\u00e4den, woraufhin diese ersticken.\nPsychologische Kriegsf\u00fchrung\nDas macht Aerosolbomben zu gef\u00fcrchteten Waffen \u2013 was wom\u00f6glich der Grund daf\u00fcr ist, dass die RPV-16 auf Sea Baby montiert wurden: psychologische Kriegsf\u00fchrung. Die Explosion soll laut der ukrainischen Armee bis zu 2.500 Grad Celsius hei\u00df werden, die Verletzungsgefahr f\u00fcr Menschen liege in einem Radius bis zu 70 Meter. Die effektive Reichweite der Rakete betrage 600 Meter, die maximale bei 1.000 Meter.\nSo furchteinfl\u00f6\u00dfend diese Daten sind: Man muss damit erst mal treffen. Da die Raketen des RPV-16 ungelenkt und die Raketenwerfer fix auf der Drohne montiert sind, kann damit nicht wirklich gezielt werden. Und auf kurze Distanz damit auf ein russisches Kriegsschiff zu schie\u00dfen, scheint Materialverschwendung. Dass die Ladung die Panzerung des Kriegsschiffes durchschl\u00e4gt, um darin Schaden anzurichten, ist eher unwahrscheinlich.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: UMPB: Neue russische Waffe in der Ukraine aufgetaucht\nGefahr zivile Ziele zu treffen\nAls eine Art improvisierte Artillerie lie\u00dfen sich die RPV-16 schon einsetzen. Ohne guter Zielm\u00f6glichkeit ist die Gefahr allerdings gro\u00df, dass etwa bei einer Welle der Schuss zu hoch abgegeben wird, \u00fcber das Milit\u00e4rziel im Hafen hinwegfliegt und ein ziviles Wohnhaus dahinter trifft.\nAbgesehen von den menschlichen Verlusten w\u00fcrde der Einsatz einer so grausamen Waffe gegen Zivilisten daf\u00fcr sorgen, dass der Ruf der Ukraine in der westlichen Welt leidet. Schlie\u00dflich wirft die Ukraine seit Kriegsbeginn Russland vor, terroristische Akte gegen Zivilisten auszuf\u00fchren. Bei so einem RPV-16-Zwischenfall w\u00fcrde die terroristische Aktion aber von der Ukraine ausgehen.\nAu\u00dferdem werden die RPV-16 dringender an der Front ben\u00f6tigt. Dort werden damit befestige russische Stellungen und Grabensysteme angegriffen oder H\u00e4user im St\u00e4dtekampf ger\u00e4umt.\nNeue Raketenwerfer-Drohne ist eine Resteverwertung\nDie jetzt vom SBU gezeigte Sea-Baby-Variante scheint eine vern\u00fcnftigere Weiterentwicklung zu sein. Anstatt RPV-16s werden hier 6 Rohre samt Raketen des Grad-Systems verbaut.\nDer Mehrfachraketenwerfer wurde in der Sowjetunion entwickelt und wird seit 1963 eingesetzt. Er gilt als Nachfolger der Katjuscha, die im Zweiten Weltkrieg den Spitznamen \u201eStalinorgel\u201c erhalten hat.\nDas Prinzip ist seitdem gleich geblieben. Die Grad-Raketen im Kaliber 122mm sind ungelenkt und werden als Salve abgefeuert. Dadurch kann ein gro\u00dfes Gebiet mit vielen nahezu simultanen Einschl\u00e4gen \u00fcbers\u00e4t werden.\nDurch die weite Verbreitung des Grad-Systems hat auch die Ukraine etliche Werferrohre und die passenden Raketen im Arsenal. Die normalen Raketen haben eine Reichweite von 20 Kilometern, was f\u00fcr die Zwecke der Ukraine zu gering ist \u2013 hier w\u00fcrde man in die Reichweite russischer Gleitbomben und moderner Artillerie kommen, noch bevor der Grad-Lkw \u00fcberhaupt eine g\u00fcnstige Abschussposition erreicht hat. Daher macht es Sinn, die sonst nicht mehr ben\u00f6tigten Arsenalware f\u00fcr andere Zwecke zu verwenden.\n\u00dcberraschungs- und Ablenkungsangriffe vom Meer aus\nWie Suspilne berichtet, wurden die Grad-Drohnenboote bereits im Winter 2023 an Land getestet. Einen best\u00e4tigten Einsatz von ihnen gibt es noch nicht. Unklar ist, welche Ziele damit angegriffen werden sollen.\nM\u00f6glich ist, dass damit feindliche Stellungen in K\u00fcstenn\u00e4he oder milit\u00e4rische Hafenanlagen angegriffen werden soll. Weil Russland nicht mit einem Artillerieschlag vom Meer aus rechnet, k\u00f6nnten so \u00dcberraschungs- oder Ablenkungsangriffe ausgef\u00fchrt werden. Das Ziel k\u00f6nnte sein, dadurch russische Truppen in Abwehr- oder Verteidigungsstellungen zu locken, wodurch L\u00fccken an der Front entstehen, die ukrainische Landtruppen f\u00fcr Angriffe nutzen k\u00f6nnen.\nSchrotflinten-Effekt gegen russische Kriegsschiffe\nDenkbar w\u00e4re auch, dass die 6 Raketenwerferrohre in einem flacheren Winkel montiert werden, sodass diese tiefer fliegen. Werden alle 6 St\u00fcck, so wie im Video gezeigt, gleichzeitig abgefeuert, entsteht eine Art Schrotflinten-Effekt.

The document suggests that governments can monitor when and where encrypted communications occur, potentially allowing powerful inferences about who is conversing with whom. The report adds: Even though the contents of WhatsApp communications are unreadable, the assessment shows how governments can use their access to internet infrastructure to monitor when and where encrypted communications are occurring, like observing a mail carrier ferrying a sealed envelope. This view into national internet traffic is enough to make powerful inferences about which individuals are conversing with each other, even if the subjects of their conversations remain a mystery. \"Even assuming WhatsApp's encryption is unbreakable,\" the assessment reads, \"ongoing 'collect and correlate' attacks would still break our intended privacy model.\"\nThe WhatsApp threat assessment does not describe specific instances in which it knows this method has been deployed by state actors. But it cites extensive reporting by the New York Times and Amnesty International showing how countries around the world spy on dissident encrypted chat app usage, including WhatsApp, using the very same techniques. As war has grown increasingly computerized, metadata -- information about the who, when, and where of conversations -- has come to hold immense value to intelligence, military, and police agencies around the world. \"We kill people based on metadata,\" former National Security Agency chief Michael Hayden once infamously quipped.

The original C++ compiler outputs C code, for example. Enhanced versions of Fortran were often just conversions of new syntax to old syntax. Of course, it makes sense to output to some language that can run on lots of different platforms. So, using that logic, Amber makes perfect sense. It targets \u2014 no kidding \u2014 bash. You write with nice modern syntax and compile-time checks. The output is a bash script. Admittedly, sometimes a hard-to-read bash script, but still.\nIf you want to see the source code, it is available on GitHub. Since Windows doesn\u2019t really support bash \u2014 if you don\u2019t count things like Cygwin and WSL \u2014 Amber only officially supports Linux and MacOS. In addition to compiling files, Amber can also execute scripts directly which can be useful for a quick one-liner. If you use Visual Studio Code, you can find a syntax highlighter extension for Amber.\nTo get a flavor of how it works, here\u2019s a simple Amber file to rename some files:\nlet files = [\"config.json\", \"file.txt\", \"audio.mp3\"] loop index, file in files { $mv {file} {index}{file}$ failed { echo \"Failed to rename {file}\" } }\nHere\u2019s the output shell script:\n__AMBER_ARRAY_0=(\"config.json\" \"file.txt\" \"audio.mp3\"); __0_files=(\"${__AMBER_ARRAY_0[@]}\"); index=0; for file in \"${__0_files[@]}\" do mv ${file} ${index}${file} __AMBER_STATUS=$?; if [ $__AMBER_STATUS != 0 ]; then echo \"Failed to rename ${file}\" fi let index=${index}+1 done\nLooks much easier. Still, bash isn\u2019t that hard. If you must have bash scripts for some reason, this might be worth a look. As a general-purpose programming language, you should probably stick with something more traditional.\nCatching errors early is a good thing, but there are other ways to do that. While you could probably use a debugger on the output bash code, it looks a bit hard to follow, so an Amber debugger would be welcome.\n10 thoughts on \u201cAmber Compiles To Bash\u201d\nThat simple example is not going to work if any of the filenames have spaces in.\nRight out of their documentation. I didn\u2019t look but the key would be if the bash is quoted not necessarily if it is quoted in Amber since I don\u2019t think it has that notion. So even if that is true, the compiler could (and should) quote everything defensively, I would think.\nI once wrote a compiler which targeted GNU Make files. (Macro language, no shell callouts.) Working with a language which doesn\u2019t have arithmetic was a challenge, but I got three-quarters of the way through a maths standard library before coming to my senses \u2014 addition, subtraction and multiplication. I did have enough to run Conway\u2019s Game Of Life, very slowly.\nhttp://cowlark.com/2013-10-19-insane-make/index.html\nOh, that is awesome! Although reading the makefile code feels a little like I\u2019ve been staring at car crash longer than I should have been staring. :)\nAdmittedly I don\u2019t do Win64 work often (usually open source), but feel a Windows install isn\u2019t complete until Cygwin is install (but I am bias since that came from a former employer of mine).\nNow, what about compiling Amber to BASH, then BASH to C, and C to a local (or cross-compiled) binary:\nhttps://github.com/neurobin/shc\nIf compiling stuff to other languages looks like fun for you, then have a look at Ribbit: https://github.com/udem-dlteam/ribbit\nThis is clever, but it feels like you\u2019d be better in almost every situation with a python script. And that\u2019s coming from me who isn\u2019t a fan of python.\nI use Python a lot. In the Windoze world at work, I did remove all batch files from one of our systems and converted them to Python 3 (along with what was being called from the batch file like a VB script in Excel or Access). Only made sense. KISS principle. And very maintainable. That system is very reliable now, where before it needed a boot to the head every few days/weeks. Same with Linux. I use bash for simple one-liners like calling rsync multiple times to backup a few directories \u2014 say \u2018rsync -av here there\u2019. Anything more complicated and it gets a Python script, or to compiled language depending on the job at hand.\nNow a days it really isn\u2019t necessary to convert language to another language as you a have MANY languages already to handle the situation. If Python doesn\u2019t work for situation, maybe Perl. Or go heavy with Java, or C/C++, C#, Pascal, Fortran/Cobol ;) , Rust, Ada, etc. \u2026. Bash application programming should be retired to the dust bin of history and just used for very very \u2018small\u2019 scripts IMHO.

PITA is an understatement.\nTakes me back to the time in the early 80\u2019s when I needed to create a tool to allow users to operate a rather complex Watkins-Johnson radio measurement receiver. The said beast provided numerous combinations of LO frequency, pre-selector bandwidth , IF bandwidth and peak detector response time that would silently allow the user to take measurements outside the instrument\u2019s calibration boundaries. The best solution seemed to be to write a simple GUI to run on a PDP11-23 and VT125 that monitored the user\u2019s selected instrument settings and guided the user through the corresponding calibration limits.. The interface to the receiver was coded in assembler while Fortran was the \u201chigh level\u201d language used for the GUI development due to a combination of available technology and parsimoniousness on the part of the company I was working for at that time.\nFor those of you that have not had the pleasure of coding in Fortran it\u2019s an extremely inefficient language in terms of the number of keystrokes and care required in formatting for the actual amount of machine code produced. Only when I ran into yaml did I realize that it maybe Fortran wasn\u2019t that bad \u2013 while yaml may not be that verbose the formatting is a real pain in the tail-end.\nThe solution was a terse meta-language that when input to two TECO editor macros fleshed out 95%+ compilable Fortran code.\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

GPT-4o macht ChatGPT nicht nur schneller, sondern auch multi-modal. Ausgew\u00e4hlte Nutzer k\u00f6nnen ab sofort Bilder, Audio, Videos und nat\u00fcrlich Text in ChatGPT eingeben. Au\u00dferdem gibt es eine neue Desktop-App f\u00fcr den Mac, die ChatGPT aus dem Browser holt. c't 3003 hat sich GPT-4o angeschaut.\nTranskript des Videos\n(Hinweis: Dieses Transkript ist f\u00fcr Menschen gedacht, die das Video oben nicht schauen k\u00f6nnen oder wollen. Der Text gibt nicht alle Informationen der Bildspur wieder.)\nGuckt mal hier, ChatGPT ist jetzt doppelt so schnell. Genau genommen laut unseres Testes sogar etwas mehr als doppelt so schnell. Ich hab hier mal das Gedicht \"Der Erlk\u00f6nig\" aufschreiben lassen. Und GPT-4o war 2,6-mal so schnell. M\u00f6glich macht das die neueste Version vom Sprachmodell GPT-4o. Damit wird ChatGPT aber nicht nur schneller, sondern soll auch passendere Antworten liefern und wirklich kontextbezogen mitdenken und weiterhelfen. Und das alles ist im Gegensatz zum normalen GPT-4 auch noch kostenlos f\u00fcr alle Nutzer.\nUnd keine Sorge, ich bin kein KI-Keno und Keno ist auch nicht weg oder so. Der hat gerade nur Urlaub, und ich mache immer wieder mal Videos, wenn Keno eine Vertretung braucht. Sonst teile ich mir mit Keno ein B\u00fcro bei der c\u2019t und arbeite an Videos hinter der Kamera mit.\nAlso, GPT-4o soll das beste Sprachmodell sein und obendrauf gibt es jetzt auch noch eine Desktop-App f\u00fcr den Mac. Ist das ein wirklich gro\u00dfes Update und ver\u00e4ndert die Arbeit mit generativer KI oder ist das nur ein kleiner Schritt? Wir finden es gleich gemeinsam raus. Also bleibt dran!\nLiebe Hackerinnen, liebe Internet-Surfer, herzlich willkommen hier bei...\nAlso, ChatGPT-4o wird gerade genauso wie die neue ChatGPT-Mac-Desktop-App schrittweise ausgerollt. Wenn euer Account f\u00fcr GPT-4o freigeschaltet wird, k\u00f6nnt ihr das einfach hier oben in der ChatGPT-Oberfl\u00e4che ausw\u00e4hlen. Im Browser, in der Smartphone-App und nat\u00fcrlich auch in der Mac-Desktop-App. Die ist allerdings noch nicht f\u00fcr alle Nutzer verf\u00fcgbar. \u00dcber diesen Link aus dem ChatGPT-Forum l\u00e4sst sich das Programm zwar installieren, aber beim Einloggen gibt es dann diese Fehlermeldung. Dauert also noch etwas.\nAber an sich ist das auf jeden Fall ein kluger Move von OpenAI, den Browser zu verlassen. Alle gro\u00dfen Browser-Anbieter arbeiten an eigenen KI-Modellen und damit wird es ChatGPT irgendwann schwer in diesen Browsern haben. Chrome wird dann ziemlich sicher Gemini integriert haben und Safari sehr wahrscheinlich die angek\u00fcndigte Apple-KI. In Microsoft Edge ist Copilot bereits von oben bis unten integriert. Also: Nachvollziehbar, dass OpenAI aus dem Browser raus will. Aber worauf ich sowieso mehr gespannt bin: Wie gut ist das neue Sprachmodell?\nW\u00e4hrend GPT-4 nur als Teil des kostenpflichtigen Abos verf\u00fcgbar ist und war (bzw. man es in einer ver\u00e4nderten Variante kostenlos als Microsoft Copilot nutzen kann), steht der Nachfolger mit einer begrenzten Anzahl an Anfragen pro Tag von vornherein allen zur Verf\u00fcgung. Premium-Kunden bekommen dabei mehr Anfragen. Bei unseren Tests war GPT-4o allerdings in unserem kostenlosen Account noch nicht freigeschaltet, in unserem bezahlten schon. Deshalb konnten wir bislang auch noch nicht testen, ob die kostenlose GPT-4o-Variante langsamer ist als die des Plus-Abos.\nBislang funktioniert GPT-4o nur text- und bildbasiert. Der neue Voice-Mode von GPT-4o kommt erst in den n\u00e4chsten Wochen. Den kann man bisher also nur in den Videos von OpenAI selbst sehen. Aber da wirkt er ehrlich gesagt schon ziemlich beeindruckend. Wie die Textgenerierung auch, ist der deutlich schneller geworden.\nGPT-4o kann in nur 232 Millisekunden auf Audio-Eingaben reagieren. Das ist fast so schnell, wie wir Menschen in Gespr\u00e4chen reagieren. Zum Vergleich: Die alten Modelle brauchten daf\u00fcr 2,8 bis 5,4 Sekunden. Das ist genau der Flaschenhals bei Sprachassistenten. Wenn die Reaktionszeit zu lange ist, kann man es schneller selbst machen, als eine KI zu fragen. Aber wenn ich mit ChatGPT jetzt sprechen kann und es schnell arbeitet und auch noch menschlich klingt, ist das vielleicht ein Gamechanger f\u00fcr Sprachassistenten. Achtet selbst mal drauf, mit Alexa, Siri und auch dem bisherigen ChatGPT-Sprachchat redet man wegen der Verz\u00f6gerung automatisch sehr unnat\u00fcrlich, also so: \u201eWIE. WIRD. DAS. WETTER. HEUTE. IN. HANNOVER?\u201c Kommen die Antworten sofort, redet man automatisch nat\u00fcrlich: \u201eEy, sag mal, wie wird denn das Wetter heute?\u201c\nGPT-4o kann ruhige von aufgeregten Atemz\u00fcgen unterscheiden und Emotionen in synthetischer Sprache ausdr\u00fccken. Es kann auch Videos oder Grafiken live analysieren, indem man zum Beispiel die Smartphone-Kamera aktiviert. Es kann sogar Emotionen in Gesichtern in einem Video oder auf einem Foto erkennen und beschreiben und entsprechend darauf reagieren. Laut OpenAI soll das neue Modell doppelt so schnell und 50 Prozent g\u00fcnstiger als der Vorg\u00e4nger GPT-4 Turbo sein. Das ist nat\u00fcrlich nice, wenn ich GPT-4 kommerziell \u00fcber die API nutze. Die H\u00e4lfte an Kosten und bessere Ergebnisse.\nAchso, und falls ihr euch fragt, woher das \u201eo\u201c kommt in \u201eGPT-4o\u201c: Das soll \u201eomni\u201c hei\u00dfen, also Latein f\u00fcr: alle, alles, ganz \u2013 eben weil das Sprachmodell nicht nur Text kann, sondern auch Bilder, Video, Audio. (Kurzer Einschub: Um wirklich \u201eomni\u201c zu sein, m\u00fcsste es auch schmecken, riechen, f\u00fchlen k\u00f6nnen; aber ok.) GPT-4o hat seinen Vorg\u00e4nger GPT-4 Turbo in der LMSys Arena, einem Benchmark f\u00fcr Sprachmodelle, um rund 60 Punkte \u00fcbertroffen. Bei schwierigeren Aufgaben, insbesondere im Bereich der Programmierung, ist der Vorsprung sogar noch gr\u00f6\u00dfer: Hier erreicht GPT-4o einen um 100 Punkte h\u00f6heren Wert als sein Vorg\u00e4nger.\nIn der Chatbot Arena von LMSys k\u00f6nnen User einen Prompt eingeben und dann ausw\u00e4hlen, welches Sprachmodell besser geantwortet hat. Hier mal ein Beispiel. Ich wei\u00df nicht, welcher Text von welchem Modell stammt. Ich entscheide mich f\u00fcr A und sehe dann: Das ist GPT-4o.\nBei traditionellen Benchmarks erreicht GPT-4o laut OpenAI die Leistung von GPT-4 Turbo bei Text, logischem Denken und Programmieren, setzt aber neue Bestwerte bei mehrsprachigen Aufgaben sowie beim Audio- und Bildverst\u00e4ndnis.\nAber dazu muss ich sagen: GPT-4 Turbo mit 128.000 Token fand ich immer etwas schlechter als das normale GPT-4-Modell mit 32.000 Token. Also von daher, wenn das neue Modell jetzt die Geschwindigkeit von GPT-4 Turbo hat und noch bessere Antworten liefert. Perfekt.\nMir war vor allem wichtig herauszufinden, ob GPT-4o \u2013 wie alle anderen Chatbots auch \u2013 halluziniert. Das machen n\u00e4mlich alle, vor allem in Themenbereichen, wo ihnen Trainingsinhalte fehlen. Anstatt zu melden \u201eSorry, wei\u00df ich nicht\u201c fabulieren LLMs munter drauf los. Wir testen zum Beispiel immer gerne mit ungew\u00f6hnlichen Touristenattraktionen in Nicht-Metropolen \u2013 je kleiner die Stadt, desto gr\u00f6\u00dfer ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit, auf Halluzinationen zu sto\u00dfen. Vor allem, wenn man direkt 10 oder 20 Attraktionen haben will.\nUnd ja, da halluziniert auch GPT-4o: Die Sprengel-Schokoladenfabrik ist seit 1980 geschlossen, der \u201eunterirdische Bereich unter der Kr\u00f6pcke-Uhr\u201c ist einfach eine normale U-Bahn-Station und der Fuchsbau ist keine \u201ekreative Event-Location\u201c, sondern ein Festival, das einmal im Jahr f\u00fcr ein Wochenende stattfindet. Interessant ist aber, dass die Halluzinationen nicht komplett ausgedacht, sondern quasi mit einem Fu\u00df in der Realit\u00e4t stehen \u2013 also so etwas wie meine Lieblingshalluzination damals, als Google Bard erz\u00e4hlt hat, es g\u00e4be in Hannover eine Stra\u00dfe, die mit Knochen und Sch\u00e4deln dekoriert ist. (Hier mal ein Best-of, was Chatbots schon frei erfunden haben). Ich habe ChatGPT-4o auch nach einem Ort gefragt, der so besonders ist, dass man ihn nicht auf Google findet. Und diesen R\u00fcdigerstollen findet man tats\u00e4chlich nicht auf Google. Das ist scheinbar ein Stollen aus dem Zweiten Weltkrieg. Aber den scheint es wirklich zu geben, auch wenn er heute nicht mehr \u00f6ffentlich zug\u00e4nglich ist. Vermutlich hat GPT-4o in den Trainingsdaten irgendein Archiv aus Hannover.\nUnsere Test-Videos zu Chatbots werden irgendwie immer k\u00fcrzer. Klar, wir probieren alle Tests aus. Aber oft sind die Ergebnisse nicht krass anders und deswegen kauen wir das nicht nochmal alles durch. Sondern nur die Highlights.\nUnd eines davon ist f\u00fcr mich klar der Humor und die Sprachf\u00e4higkeit von GPT-4o. Wir haben nat\u00fcrlich wieder den klassischen c\u2019t-3003-Witz-Benchmark laufen lassen \u2013 und GPT-4o schafft den bisher besten Witz mit einem Schokoladenkuchen, Martin Luther und einem Raspi von einer KI.\nMartin Luther, ein Schokoladenkuchen und ein Raspberry Pi sitzen in einem Caf\u00e9.\nMartin Luther schaut den Schokoladenkuchen an und sagt: \u201eWas machst du hier?\u201c\nDer Schokoladenkuchen antwortet: \u201eIch bin hier, um den Menschen Freude zu bringen!\u201c\nDa meldet sich der Raspberry Pi zu Wort und sagt: \u201eUnd ich bin hier, um die Welt zu revolutionieren!\u201c\nMartin Luther lacht und sagt: \u201eNun, dann sind wir alle auf einer Mission, die Menschheit zu ver\u00e4ndern \u2013 einer von uns mit 95 Thesen, einer mit 95 Prozent Kakao und einer mit 95 Prozessoren!\u201c\nJoa. Ist noch Luft nach oben. Aber die Messlatte liegt auch nicht super hoch bei den anderen Chatbots. Also da ist schon viel gewonnen, wenn ein Witz Sinn ergibt. Und wenn er dann auch noch etwas Humor hat, passt.\nUnd ansonsten hat GPT-4o im Bild- und Textmodus wirklich gut funktioniert. Hier hab ich beispielsweise ein Bild von Keno in einen Cartoon wandeln lassen. Richtig gut und damit kann man wirklich einiges machen. Theoretisch auch Videos mit eingebrannten Untertiteln auf Rechtschreibfehler \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen lassen. Hat nur leider bei mir nicht immer geklappt. Manchmal hat er das nicht auslesen k\u00f6nnen und mir dann vorgeschlagen, das doch selbst zu machen \u2013 indem ich die einzelnen Frames mit Text runterlade. Das m\u00fcssten zwar mindestens 25 Bilder sein. Aber angeboten hat er mir nur 6.\nWas mich echt beeindruckt hat: Ich habe aus den Attraktionen in Hannover noch eine Karte machen lassen. Das ist dann eine HTML-Datei geworden mit einer Karte von Hannover, auf der die Top-Attraktionen aus der vorherigen Antwort eingezeichnet waren.\nEine Sache, die leider auch nicht mit ChatGPT-4o funktioniert: Dieses PDF mit einer Urlaubsplanung sch\u00f6ner zu machen. Also wirklich eigentlich was ganz Banales. Was ich in 15 Minuten einfach machen k\u00f6nnte, weil es eben recht stupide ist. Die Formatierung etwas bearbeiten, die Links k\u00fcrzen, eine Karte screenshoten, in der die einzelnen Unterk\u00fcnfte und die Wanderroute eingezeichnet sind. Und dann noch ein Bild von jeder Unterkunft einf\u00fcgen. Das hat bisher noch kein Chatbot geschafft. Und auch GPT-4o kommt da an die Grenzen. Ich bekomme zwar noch eine genaue Vorgehensweise gezeigt, aber ein PDF zum Download bekomme ich nie. ChatGPT versucht noch ein Python-Skript zum Erstellen der PDF zu schreiben, aber auch das funktioniert nicht. Am Ende hab ich den Text mit den verk\u00fcrzten Links dann einfach in Word kopiert. Immerhin die Formatierung war jetzt schon mal sch\u00f6ner \u2013 ABER die verk\u00fcrzten Links haben nicht funktioniert. Das musste ich also nochmal machen. Also da der Text gut ist, w\u00e4re ChatGPT-4o so am Desktop wirklich praktisch, wenn das dann direkt in Office-Texte einf\u00fcgen k\u00f6nnte zum Beispiel. Aber ich habe GPT-4o nicht nur in ChatGPT ausprobiert.\nNeben dem Chatbot habe ich GPT-4o auch noch in DC I/O getestet. Das ist ein KI-Tool, das wir bei der c\u2019t verwenden, um Texte zu erstellen. Also ich lade zum Beispiel dieses Skript in das Tool und benutze dann meinen Prompt, der aus dem Transkript einen Artikel-Entwurf macht. Ich kann mir dann hier noch das Sprachmodell aussuchen. Und da gibt es jetzt eben auch GPT-4o. Das hat richtig gut funktioniert und war auch noch ein gutes St\u00fcck schneller als die anderen Sprachmodelle. \u00dcbrigens: Wir schreiben damit nat\u00fcrlich keine ganzen Texte oder Video-Skripte. Haupts\u00e4chlich benutzen wir das, um Transkripte von Whisper auf Rechtschreibfehler zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen oder mal ein Transkript zusammenzufassen, f\u00fcr den Newsletter. Und klar, da steigt die Qualit\u00e4t nat\u00fcrlich auch mit dem neuen Sprachmodell von OpenAI.\nFazit\nGPT-4o ist schnell, also in den meisten F\u00e4llen doppelt so schnell wie GPT-4. Es ist allerdings nicht das schnellste aktuelle Sprachmodell, so schafft zum Beispiel Googles Gemini die drei ersten Artikel des Grundgesetzes in 10 Sekunden, GPT-4o hat bei unseren Tests ja 16 gebraucht.\nBei der Genauigkeit schneidet GPT-4o ebenfalls besser ab, halluziniert wird zwar noch, aber der, sagen wir mal, Absurdit\u00e4tsgrad sinkt (sieht man ja zum Beispiel bei den Ausflugstipps). Es gab aber auch nach wie vor richtig krasse Fehler, zum Beispiel waren die falschen verk\u00fcrzten Links. Wenn ich die nicht nochmal gepr\u00fcft h\u00e4tte, dann h\u00e4tte ich anderen einfach Links, die zu einer 404-Seite f\u00fchren, geschickt. Also auch bei GPT-4o kann man sich nicht blind auf die KI verlassen.\nWie ist das bei euch? Habt ihr schon Zugriff auf GPT-4o und auf die Mac-Desktop-App?

From a report: More than a dozen storms battered the region in quick succession between October and March, which was the second-wettest such period in nearly two centuries of records. The downpour led to severe floods, at least 20 deaths, severe damage to homes and infrastructure, power blackouts, travel cancellations, and heavy losses of crops and livestock.\nThe level of rain caused by the storms would have occurred just once in 50 years without the climate crisis, but is now expected every five years owing to 1.2C of global heating reached in recent years. If fossil fuel burning is not rapidly cut and the global temperature reaches 2C in the next decade or two, such severe wet weather would occur every three years on average, the analysis showed. [...] The analysis, conducted by climate scientists working as part of the World Weather Attribution group, compared how likely and how intense the wet winter was in today's heated world with how likely it would have been in a world without high levels of carbon emissions. Warmer air can hold more water vapour and therefore produce more rain.

Mullings pleaded guilty to eight charges in January of last year. His sentencing took place yesterday, per the DoJ.\nAccording to the feds, Mullings' helped clear the financial tracks of a scheme that ran from 2019 to July 2021 and consisted of both business email compromise (BEC) attacks and romance scams, with the former aimed at healthcare entities, among other biz, and the latter at ordinary citizens.\nBEC scams rely on social engineering the cash out of organizations, usually by impersonating a higher-up at the org or a business partner, and then requesting that funds be sent to a bank account controlled by the attacker. Mullings defrauded private companies and healthcare providers, including one state Medicaid program that gave him $310,000, a sum intended to reimburse a hospital.\nMullings also processed money defrauded from folks in romance scams, a classic social engineering con trick, with \"numerous individual victims\" falling prey, according to the DoJ. Many of the victims were elderly, who tend to be lucrative targets for many scammers due to their relatively high vulnerability as well as having retirement cash. The feds say Mullings and his co-conspirators engaged in financial transactions designed to conceal the fraud proceeds, which included $260,000 taken from a single victim, which they say Mullings used to buy a Ferrari. He also bought jewelry and other luxury items.\nPurchasing a high-end car was apparently not just an indulgence, but also served as a way to launder ill-gotten gains, according to the original charges brought in November 2022 by the DoJ, which charged nine other suspects alongside Mullings \u2013 seven from Georgia, one from South Carolina, and one from Virginia.

The 486 was the hot new CPU of the early 90s, while Windows XP became a household name and Microsoft's most popular OS over a decade later. But did you ever imagine these two icons of different eras could be merged into an unholy union? Well, start brushing off those vintage 486 rigs, because a modder has actually made it happen.

The first 486 chips hit the market way back in 1989, while Windows XP landed over a decade later in 2001. The 486 represented a major breakthrough when Intel unveiled it in 1989. Packing over a million transistors, it remained Intel's primary x86 chip until the arrival of the Pentium in 1993. Such was the processor's longevity that Intel continued manufacturing it for embedded systems until 2007. Still, 486 systems were simply too underpowered to run XP, which needed at least a Pentium-class processor from the 586 generation - or any compatible chip that ran at 233MHz or higher. Meanwhile, the i486 could only do 133MHz. It also needed at least 64MB of RAM and at least 1.5GB of storage.\nIt's worth mentioning that these two were never meant to coexist.

According to the previously unreported threat assessment obtained by The Intercept, the contents of conversations among the app\u2019s 2 billion users remain secure. But government agencies, the engineers wrote, were \u201cbypassing our encryption\u201d to figure out which users communicate with each other, the membership of private groups, and perhaps even their locations.\nThe vulnerability is based on \u201ctraffic analysis,\u201d a decades-old network-monitoring technique, and relies on surveying internet traffic at a massive national scale. The document makes clear that WhatsApp isn\u2019t the only messaging platform susceptible. But it makes the case that WhatsApp\u2019s owner, Meta, must quickly decide whether to prioritize the functionality of its chat app or the safety of a small but vulnerable segment of its users.\n\u201cWhatsApp should mitigate the ongoing exploitation of traffic analysis vulnerabilities that make it possible for nation states to determine who is talking to who,\u201d the assessment urged. \u201cOur at-risk users need robust and viable protections against traffic analysis.\u201d\nAgainst the backdrop of the ongoing war on Gaza, the threat warning raised a disturbing possibility among some employees of Meta. WhatsApp personnel have speculated Israel might be exploiting this vulnerability as part of its program to monitor Palestinians at a time when digital surveillance is helping decide who to kill across the Gaza Strip, four employees told The Intercept.\n\u201cWhatsApp has no backdoors and we have no evidence of vulnerabilities in how WhatsApp works,\u201d said Meta spokesperson Christina LoNigro.\nThough the assessment describes the \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d as \u201congoing,\u201d and specifically mentions WhatsApp 17 times, LoNigro said the document is \u201cnot a reflection of a vulnerability in WhatsApp,\u201d only \u201ctheoretical,\u201d and not unique to WhatsApp. LoNigro did not answer when asked if the company had investigated whether Israel was exploiting this vulnerability.\nEven though the contents of WhatsApp communications are unreadable, the assessment shows how governments can use their access to internet infrastructure to monitor when and where encrypted communications are occurring, like observing a mail carrier ferrying a sealed envelope. This view into national internet traffic is enough to make powerful inferences about which individuals are conversing with each other, even if the subjects of their conversations remain a mystery. \u201cEven assuming WhatsApp\u2019s encryption is unbreakable,\u201d the assessment reads, \u201congoing \u2018collect and correlate\u2019 attacks would still break our intended privacy model.\u201d\nThe WhatsApp threat assessment does not describe specific instances in which it knows this method has been deployed by state actors. But it cites extensive reporting by the New York Times and Amnesty International showing how countries around the world spy on dissident encrypted chat app usage, including WhatsApp, using the very same techniques.\nAs war has grown increasingly computerized, metadata \u2014 information about the who, when, and where of conversations \u2014 has come to hold immense value to intelligence, military, and police agencies around the world. \u201cWe kill people based on metadata,\u201d former National Security Agency chief Michael Hayden once infamously quipped.\nBut even baseless analyses of metadata can be lethal, according to Matthew Green, a professor of cryptography at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThese metadata correlations are exactly that: correlations. Their accuracy can be very good or even just good. But they can also be middling,\u201d Green said. \u201cThe nature of these systems is that they\u2019re going to kill innocent people and nobody is even going to know why.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t until the April publication of an expos\u00e9 about Israel\u2019s data-centric approach to war that the WhatsApp threat assessment became a point of tension inside Meta.\nA joint report by +972 Magazine and Local Call revealed last month that Israel\u2019s army uses a software system called Lavender to automatically greenlight Palestinians in Gaza for assassination. Tapping a massive pool of data about the Strip\u2019s 2.3 million inhabitants, Lavender algorithmically assigns \u201calmost every single person in Gaza a rating from 1 to 100, expressing how likely it is that they are a militant,\u201d the report states, citing six Israeli intelligence officers. \u201cAn individual found to have several different incriminating features will reach a high rating, and thus automatically becomes a potential target for assassination.\u201d\nThe report indicated WhatsApp usage is among the multitude of personal characteristics and digital behaviors the Israeli military uses to mark Palestinians for death, citing a book on AI targeting written by the current commander of Unit 8200, Israel\u2019s equivalent of the NSA. \u201cThe book offers a short guide to building a \u2018target machine,\u2019 similar in description to Lavender, based on AI and machine-learning algorithms,\u201d according to the +972 expos\u00e9. \u201cIncluded in this guide are several examples of the \u2018hundreds and thousands\u2019 of features that can increase an individual\u2019s rating, such as being in a Whatsapp group with a known militant.\u201d\nThe Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment, but told The Guardian last month that it \u201cdoes not use an artificial intelligence system that identifies terrorist operatives or tries to predict whether a person is a terrorist.\u201d The military stated that Lavender \u201cis simply a database whose purpose is to cross-reference intelligence sources, in order to produce up-to-date layers of information on the military operatives of terrorist organizations. This is not a list of confirmed military operatives eligible to attack.\u201d\nIt was only after the publication of the Lavender expos\u00e9 and subsequent writing on the topic that a wider swath of Meta staff discovered the March WhatsApp threat assessment, said the four company sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation by their employer. Reading how governments might be able to extract personally identifying metadata from WhatsApp\u2019s encrypted conversations triggered deep concern that this same vulnerability could feed into Lavender or other Israeli military targeting systems.\nEfforts to press Meta from within to divulge what it knows about the vulnerability and any potential use by Israel have been fruitless, the sources said, in line with what they describe as a broader pattern of internal censorship against expressions of sympathy or solidarity with Palestinians since the war began.\nMeta employees concerned by the possibility their product is putting innocent people in Israeli military crosshairs, among other concerns related to the war, have organized under a campaign they\u2019re calling Metamates 4 Ceasefire. The group has published an open letter signed by more than 80 named staff members. One of its demands is \u201can end to censorship \u2014 stop deleting employee\u2019s words internally.\u201d\nMeta spokesperson Andy Stone told The Intercept any workplace discussion of the war is subject to the company\u2019s general workplace conduct rules, and denied such speech has been singled out. \u201cOur policy is written with that in mind and outlines the types of discussions that are appropriate for the workplace. If employees want to raise concerns, there are established channels for doing so.\u201d\nAccording to the internal assessment, the stakes are high: \u201cInspection and analysis of network traffic is completely invisible to us, yet it reveals the connections between our users: who is in a group together, who is messaging who, and (hardest to hide) who is calling who.\u201d\nThe analysis notes that a government can easily tell when a person is using WhatsApp, in part because the data must pass through Meta\u2019s readily identifiable corporate servers. A government agency can then unmask specific WhatsApp users by tracing their IP address, a unique number assigned to every connected device, to their internet or cellular service provider account.\nWhatsApp\u2019s internal security team has identified several examples of how clever observation of encrypted data can thwart the app\u2019s privacy protections, a technique known as a correlation attack, according to this assessment. In one, a WhatsApp user sends a message to a group, resulting in a burst of data of the exact same size being transmitted to the device of everyone in that group. Another correlation attack involves measuring the time delay between when WhatsApp messages are sent and received between two parties \u2014 enough data, the company believes, \u201cto infer the distance to and possibly the location of each recipient.\u201d\nThe internal warning notes that these attacks require all members of a WhatsApp group or both sides of a conversation to be on the same network and within the same country or \u201ctreaty jurisdiction,\u201d a possible reference to the Five Eyes spy alliance between the U.S., Australia, Canada, U.K., and New Zealand. While the Gaza Strip has its own Palestinian-operated telecoms, its internet access ultimately runs through Israeli fiber optic cables subject to Israeli state surveillance. Although the memo suggests that users in \u201cwell functioning democracies with due process and strong privacy laws\u201d may be less vulnerable, it also highlights the NSA\u2019s use of these telecom-tapping techniques on U.S. soil.\n\u201cToday\u2019s messenger services weren\u2019t designed to hide this metadata from an adversary who can see all sides of the connection,\u201d Green, the cryptography professor, told The Intercept. \u201cProtecting content is only half the battle. Who you communicate [with] and when is the other half.\u201d\nThe assessment reveals WhatsApp has been aware of this threat since last year, and notes the same surveillance techniques work against other competing apps. \u201cAlmost all major messenger applications and communication tools do not include traffic analysis attacks in their threat models,\u201d said Donncha \u00d3 Cearbhaill, head of Amnesty International\u2019s Security Lab, told The Intercept. \u201cWhile researchers have known these attacks are technically possible, it was an open question if such attacks would be practical or reliable on a large scale, such as whole country.\u201d\nThe assessment makes clear that WhatsApp engineers grasp the severity of the problem, but also understand how difficult it might be to convince their company to fix it. The fact that these de-anonymization techniques have been so thoroughly documented and debated in academic literature, Green explained, is a function of just how \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d it is to neutralize them for a company like Meta. \u201cIt\u2019s a direct tradeoff between performance and responsiveness on one hand, and privacy on the other,\u201d he said.\nAsked what steps the company has taken to shore up the app against traffic analysis, Meta\u2019s spokesperson told The Intercept, \u201cWe have a proven track record addressing issues we identify and have worked to hold bad actors accountable. We have the best engineers in the world proactively looking to further harden our systems against any future threats and we will continue to do so.\u201d\nThe WhatsApp threat assessment notes that beefing up security comes at a cost for an app that prides itself on mass appeal. It will be difficult to better protect users against correlation attacks without making the app worse in other ways, the document explains. For a publicly traded giant like Meta, protecting at-risk users will collide with the company\u2019s profit-driven mandate of making its software as accessible and widely used as possible.\n\u201cMeta has a bad habit of not responding to things until they become overwhelming problems,\u201d one Meta source told The Intercept, citing the company\u2019s inaction when Facebook was used to incite violence during Myanmar\u2019s Rohingya genocide. \u201cThe tension is always going to be market share, market dominance, focusing on the largest population of people rather than a small amount of people [that] could be harmed tremendously.\u201d\nThe report warns that adding an artificial delay to messages to throw off attempts to geolocate the sender and receiver of data, for instance, will make the app feel slower to all 2 billion users \u2014 most of whom will never have to worry about the snooping of intelligence agencies. Making the app transmit a regular stream of decoy data to camouflage real conversations, another idea floated in the assessment, could throw off snooping governments. But it might also have the adverse effect of hurting battery life and racking up costly mobile data bills.\nTo WhatsApp\u2019s security personnel, the right approach is clear. \u201cWhatsApp Security cannot solve traffic analysis alone,\u201d the assessment reads. \u201cWe must first all agree to take on this fight and operate as one team to build protections for these at-risk, targeted users.

Yet since not that many people are into plasma physics, every measure of progress, such as most recently by the South Korean KSTAR (Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research) tokamak, is met generally by dismissive statements about nuclear fusion always being a certain number of decades away. Looking beyond this in coverage such as the article by Science Alert about this achievement by KSTAR we can however see quite a few of these remaining challenges being touched upon.\nRecently KSTAR managed to generate 100 million degrees C plasma and maintain this for 48 seconds, a significant boost over its previous record from 2021 of 30 seconds, partially due to the new divertors that were installed. These divertors are essential for removing impurities from the plasma, yet much like the inner wall of the reactor vessel, these plasma-facing materials (PFM) bear the brunt of the super-hot plasma and any plasma instabilities, as well as the constant neutron flux from the fusion products. KSTAR now features tungsten divertors, which has become a popular material choice for this component.\nResearching the optimal PFMs, as well as plasma containment modes and methods to suppress plasma instabilities are just some of the challenges that form the road still ahead before commercial fusion can commence.\nHigh-Confinement Mode\nThe high-confinement (or H-mode) operating regime of tokamaks was first discovered in 1982 during experiments with the German ASDEX tokamak. H-mode differs from the retroactively named L-mode (for low-confinement) in that it features a much more stable plasma edge, due to as of yet unknown mechanisms that take effect when the plasma is heated to above a certain level.\nOne issue with H-mode is however the occasional edge magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities, called edge-localized modes (ELM). These occur as disruptions in the otherwise stable edge barrier in H-mode, forming a sudden burst of plasma that can eject up to 20% of the plasma\u2019s energy into the nearby PFM. This causes damage to the wall and divertors in the form of erosion (ablation) and has been a major research topic for the past decades, with control methods like resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP) being applied as early as 2003. In 2011 KSTAR became one of the tokamaks that had managed to successfully suppress (Type I) ELMs using non-axisymmetric magnetic perturbations.\nBeyond causing PFM damage, these instabilities in H-mode are also problematic in that they reduce the efficiency of the reactor, due to heat and other losses that then have to be compensated for. Yet the corollary of such a stable edge in H-mode with Type I ELM suppression is that the removal of impurities and heat from the plasma becomes very difficult. This is where the much smaller, Type II ELMs are relevant, as they provide a means to transport impurities across the edge barrier without threatening the PFM.\nThis was simulated and experimentally tested in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak in 2022, with the results by G.F. Harrer et al. published in Physical Review Letters. Suggested is an operating regime for ITER and similar tokamak fusion reactors in which these Type II ELMs are used as a functional feature of the plasma, whereas Type I ELMs would continue to be suppressed. As for whether RMPs are the ideal way to suppress Type I ELMs, this too remains the subject of research.\nGreenwald Density\nBeyond H-mode and ELMs, tokamaks also have to deal with what is named the Greenwald Density Limit (GDL), named after Martin Greenwald, whose 2002 review article (PDF) in Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion is worth a read for a detailed summary of the subject. The short version is that it pertains to the plasma density, with each fusion reactor having an observable lower and upper limit to this density. Once the limit is reached and exceeded in a tokamak, the reaction will transition from H- to L-mode, along with other negative effects . Of note is that the scaling of these limits seems to depend on a wide variety of factors, far beyond merely the size of the reactor, such as the fueling method.\nThe Greenwald limit is more easily found with stellarator fusion reactors, as these do not display the same strong negative response to exceeding this limit. Instead they show a soft limit, or quench, that sees the plasma temperature decaying. The density limit in stellarators has been found to be significantly higher (up to double) than in comparably sized tokamaks, giving the former an edge over tokamaks, as well as in terms of plasma stability. Despite this, it is thought that these limitations of tokamaks can be compensated for, with a 2024 article by S. Ding and colleagues in Nature detailing a high-density, high-confinement tokamak plasma regime in the General Atomics DIII-D tokamak.\nCan\u2019t Rush Science\nIf you ask an engineer how long it\u2019ll take to build something, they can likely give you a fairly accurate estimate, as well as an idea of the required materials and manpower. If you ask a plasma physics scientist how long it\u2019ll take to build a nuclear fusion reactor that has an energy gain (Q) of 8 or better, they\u2019ll likely give you a quaint look. If you\u2019re lucky they\u2019ll humor you and introduce you to the wonderful world of nuclear fusion related research papers, especially those pertaining to ITER-related research.\nDuring the century since nuclear fusion was discovered, scientists have at some points thought that they were close to tackling nuclear fusion on Earth. The most pertinent being the Z-pinch machine during the 1950s, which was the moment when the solution seemed so close. This was also the moment when the exciting world of plasma physics began to be more fully revealed to the world of science, along with plasma instabilities, heat losses and a rush to find materials that could cope with the neutron flux and heat exposure inside the then brand new tokamak reactor design.\nWould larger tokamaks work better? This was just one question of many, even as fundamental research on plasma physics continued and the tokamaks at research institutes around the world underwent one revision after another based on newly gained knowledge and new directions in research. Along the edges stellarators continued to get some love too, especially once computer simulations became powerful enough to figure out an appropriate magnetic field configuration. Much like the plasma inside these experimental fusion reactors, so too did progress keep flowing.\nAlthough sideshows like inertial confinement fusion keep stealing the show despite being anything but practical for energy production, it is clear that we are lightyears beyond where we were with nuclear fusion research in the 1980s, as well as the 2000s. We cannot say yet when the moment will come when the first Q >8 fusion reactor will come online, with sustained tritium breeding and all of the other amenities that befit a commercial fusion reactor, but that\u2019s why we are still in the research and development phase.\nMaybe it will take another decade, or two. Maybe we\u2019ll have another sad Z-pinch moment where physics throws us another curveball and we have to sigh, collect our shattered self-esteem and waddle back to the drawing board for another shot at the challenge. This is both the thrill and curse of fundamental research and development, with often massive potential rewards, and absolutely zero guarantee of reaping any of them, other than learning so incredibly much along the way.\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

The campaigns are designed to sway voters\u2019 opinions and undermine trust in the democratic process. Attackers have also defaced websites and leaked data to launch influence campaigns against India\u2019s government leaders, said researchers.\nAround 16 different independent hacktivist groups are targeting Indian elections, including Anon Black Flag Indonesia, Anonymous Bangladesh, and Morocco Black Cyber Army, among others.\n\u201cThese 16 groups have targeted multiple law enforcement, government, healthcare, financial, educational, and private sector organizations in India, taking advantage of geopolitical narratives before recent elections,\u201d researchers noted.\nResecurity observed that the Ahadun-Ahad 2.0 Team has published Indian Voter ID cards on Telegram, which are issued by the Election Commission of India to 18+ individuals domiciled in India. The source of the data is unclear, but they suspect it is linked to compromised third-party entities. Earlier, cybercriminals have stolen AADHAAR, PAN, driving licenses, and NOC documents from the Dark Web, including 36 GB of personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to Indian citizens.\nThe data, primarily in graphic form with victims\u2019 selfies, could be used to spread false information, undermine trust in the electoral process, and profit from selling stolen information on the dark web. Resecurity alerted law enforcement and federal authorities to the leaked data.\nBesides graphical data files, including voter registration records and credentials from Voter Portal, the actors also leaked large data sets containing voters\u2019 credentials collected using infostealers. Such malware programs, including Nexus, Medusa, Redline, Lumma, and Racoon, are designed to steal sensitive information such as login credentials and financial data. Specific signatures identified in leaked data sets may confirm that they originate not from any vulnerable election systems, but likely from compromised consumers with malicious code. The compromised credentials could have been obtained by intercepting login forms on popular Internet browsers or by accessing password storage on compromised devices. At some point, threat actors were aiming to leak a big number of voters\u2019 records to create a perception that elections systems are vulnerable. In fact, the origin of these credentials is on the consumer side, as many Internet users are getting infected with malware due to poor network hygiene and lack of cybersecurity awareness.\nResearchers also observed public opinion manipulation campaigns targeting Indian government leaders, using data leaks, website defacements, and political narratives. These \u2018cyber-guerilla\u2019 tactics blur attribution and operate under the \u2018false flag\u2019 of independent hacktivists aiming to create social conflict between Indian and Muslim populations.\nResecurity has summarized the key risk indicators of malicious activity to increase cybersecurity awareness among Indian citizens, encouraging them not to react to any claims or narratives originating from unreliable sources planted by cybercriminals, which could affect their votes.\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n(SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, India)", "hash": "d6ae1d1ef9809d32c7b8e3dcaf1b136549fc13a71aa12d4afca7ef0a3711e183", "id": "a337863c-a368-4f65-bdb0-2162538c82a7", "link": "https://securityaffairs.com/163529/cyber-crime/hacktivists-target-elections-india.html", "osint_source_id": "d01d5487-bebf-40c5-a433-cdbe4670e633", "published": "2024-05-22T16:51:49", "source": "http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/feed", "story_id": "065a4e4a-31ab-4938-a0d5-caa5ecbac65f", "title": "Cybercriminals are targeting elections in India with influence campaigns"}], "tags": {"Bangladesh": {"name": "Bangladesh", "tag_type": "Country"}, "India": {"name": "India", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Indian": {"name": "Indian", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Indonesia": {"name": "Indonesia", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Internet": {"name": "Internet", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Mastodon": {"name": "Mastodon", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Medusa": {"name": "Medusa", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Morocco": {"name": "Morocco", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Muslim": {"name": "Muslim", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "NOC": {"name": "NOC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "USD": {"name": "USD", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Cybercriminals are targeting elections in India with influence campaigns"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-22T17:21:46.361283", "id": "bd9ee431-2546-4fe2-ab94-f92a6008ce89", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "9"}, {"created": "2024-05-22T17:15:40.410439", "id": "f48e7316-cdc2-4502-9d74-c08d645db809", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-22T16:42:00", "id": "5826acc5-0db8-4c09-b3ca-c97939f57106", "news_items": [{"author": "msmash", "content": "Russia Likely Launched Counter Space Weapon Into Low Earth Orbit Last Week, Pentagon Says (go.com) 5\nThe United States has assessed that Russia launched what is likely a counter space weapon last week that's now in the same orbit as a U.S. government satellite, Pentagon spokesman Maj.

Read this\n'Clarification' weighs in on material vs voluntary disclosures\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants to clarify guidelines for public companies regarding the disclosure of ransomware and other cybersecurity incidents.\nAccording to the breach reporting rules the federal agency adopted in July, public companies must disclose material events under Item 1.05 of Form 8-K. This is the form the SEC requires public companies to submit when they announce big changes that may be material to shareholders.\nIt means that should a publicly traded company experience a \"material\" cybersecurity intrusion \u2013 one that has a financial impact on the company's operations, or that an investor would want to know before making an investment decision \u2013 they need to publicly report it under Item 1.05. In fact, Item 1.05 is titled \"Material Cybersecurity Incidents.\"\nThe fuzziness comes into play when companies disclose a breach for which they haven't made a materiality determination, or security snafus that the company flat-out says were not material.\nFor these, fill out Item 8.01 of Form 8-K, we're told.\n\"It could be confusing for investors if companies disclose either immaterial cybersecurity incidents or incidents for which a materiality determination has not yet been made under Item 1.05,\" said Erik Gerding, director of the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance.\nBiden will veto attempts to kill off SEC's security breach reporting rules\n-\nCrooks pwned your servers? You've got four days to tell us, SEC tells public companies\n-\nSolarWinds says SEC sucks: Watchdog 'lacks competence' to regulate cybersecurity\n-\nFinance orgs have 30 days to confess cyber sins under incoming FTC rules\n-\nHe added that this \"is not intended to discourage companies from voluntarily disclosing cybersecurity incidents for which they have not yet made a materiality determination, or from disclosing incidents that companies determine to be immaterial.\"\nThese voluntary disclosures do have value, he opined, but they can also \"result in investor confusion\" and \"dilute the value\" of disclosing material cybersecurity incidents in the first place.\n\"Given the prevalence of cybersecurity incidents, this distinction between a Form 8-K filed under Item 1.05 for a cybersecurity incident determined by a company to be material and a Form 8-K voluntarily filed under Item 8.01 for other cybersecurity incidents will allow investors to more easily distinguish between the two and make better investment and voting decisions with respect to material cybersecurity incidents,\" Gerding said.\nSo, to be crystal clear, if it's material, file a Form 8-K, Item 1.05. If it's voluntary, or you've yet to determine whether it was material, go with Form 8-K, Item 8.01 instead. \u00ae", "hash": "675e535d1b1367ecce66d51353280764d55dbcdf764f9a24545839009dca28af", "id": "4cfe13b4-470c-4ece-8455-28651793c347", "link": "https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2024/05/22/sec_cybersecurity_disclosure_clarification/", "osint_source_id": "a94d3f15-5689-470c-9d1f-670b8c63491d", "published": "2024-05-22T16:30:13", "source": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/headlines.atom", "story_id": "cea9e2a1-5742-4e96-92b2-01ee5f146f1a", "title": "Confused by the SEC's IT security breach reporting rules?

This version introduces new enhancements in the Package Support Framework (PST)-MSIX Packaging Tool (MPT) Integration designed to streamline conversions for IT professionals and developers.\nIn addition, we have a version (v1.2024.508.0) available to Windows Insiders. You can access this by signing up for the Windows Insiders Program. The Insiders release features the integration of Trusted Signing, which is currently in public preview. We\u2019re excited for you to try these new features and look forward to your feedback.\nEnhancements now in general availability\nPSF-MPT fixup enhancements\nIn response to customer feedback, we have made enhancements to the PSF fixups supported through the MSIX Packaging Tool user interface. To make MSIX conversions more simple, the tool now supports additional PSF fixups including:\n\nProcess Fixups\nDynamic Library Fixup\nEnvironment Variable Fixup\nMiddleware Fixup\n\nScreenshot of PSF Fixups selection options in in the Package editor of the MSIX Packaging Tool\nIn addition to the existing fixups, the tool also has been enhanced to provide more guidance and heuristics. This will assist IT pros in selecting appropriate PSF fixups for their applications, thereby improving user guidance.\nSparse package improvements\nIn the past, invoking a sparse package would display a splash screen when launching an app from the share sheet. This was a common occurrence when a user would take an image, right-click to share, and then select the Snipping Tool as the app in the share sheet. A splash screen appears for a brief moment.\nWe understand that such interruptions, however brief, can disrupt the user\u2019s experience. That is why share sheet now honors the splash screen settings for sparse packages. This enhancement is part of our ongoing commitment to improving user experience and ensuring seamless interactions with applications.\nScreenshot of Share sheet with enhanced splash screen settings\nFeatures now in public preview\nIntegration of Trusted Signing\nOne of the most exciting features in the most recent version of the MSIX Packaging Tool is the integration of Trusted Signing, which enables remote signing of apps without requiring a local certificate on the packaging machine. A primary benefit is that it simplifies the app signing process and reduces the risk of exposing the certificate. This feature is now in public preview and can be accessed by joining the MSIX Packaging Tool Insider Program.\nBefore you start, ensure that you create three Trusted Signing resources:\n\nA Trusted Signing account\nAn identity validation\nA certificate profile\n\nIf you don\u2019t already have these resources, you can use these instructions to set them up.\nFollow the steps below to take advantage of this feature in the MSIX Packaging Tool:\n\nIn the Application Package Wizard, go to the Create package flow, and proceed to Select installer.\nFrom the drop-down menu under Signing Preference, select the Sign with Azure Trusted Signing option.\nConfigure the attributes with your Trusted Signing Account name and the Certificate Profile name.\nFrom the drop-down menu, select the Azure Region name where your Trusted Signing resource is available.\nProceed with the rest of the packaging steps to generate the signed MSIX package.\n\nScreenshot of Create new package feature and settings in the MSIX Packaging Tool\nMSIX Developer Survey 2024\nWe\u2019re inviting developers to contribute to the enhancement of MSIX! We\u2019ve initiated a survey to gauge your experience with MSIX and discover areas for improvement. By sparing a few minutes to share your thoughts, you can play a crucial role in refining MSIX for the developer community.

Earlier this month, the head of the PST warned that Russia was preparing acts of sabotage in the west of the country where its naval bases and oil and gas facilities are based.\nThe pair of warnings follows Norway\u2019s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re describing Russia as posing \u201ca real and serious threat\u201d to the country\u2019s oil and gas industry, following the arrests of seven Russians in Norway in connection to incidents in which drones were flown over major energy installations.\nElsewhere in Europe, three arrests in Poland were announced this week, with Prime Minister Donald Tusk saying that the country\u2019s security services had caught suspected saboteurs whom they believed were directed by Russia\u2019s intelligence agencies.\nThe three arrests add to the nine detentions of suspected members of a Russian espionage ring last year, which Polish authorities believed was also preparing acts of sabotage. The arrests in Poland have included two men suspected of hacking the national railway\u2019s communications network, and a professional ice hockey player who is accused of conducting espionage for Moscow.\nThe uptick in arrests and warnings follows NATO and the European Union condemning \u201cintensifying\u201d Russian sabotage and hybrid operations earlier this month.\nThe North Atlantic Council, NATO\u2019s political executive, announced that allies were \u201cdeeply concerned about recent malign activities on Allied territory, including those resulting in the investigation and charging of multiple individuals in connection with hostile state activity.\u201d\nThe European Council, the EU\u2019s political executive, subsequently alleged that a cyber campaign attributed to Russia\u2019s military intelligence service showed \u201cRussia\u2019s continuous pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace, by targeting democratic institutions, government entities and critical infrastructure providers across the European Union and beyond.\u201d\nAmid these concerns, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported that explosives were discovered buried near an oil pipeline in Germany this week.\nThe concerns about Russia\u2019s sabotage operations extend well beyond the Kremlin\u2019s neighbors.\nIn the U.K., two British nationals have been arrested within the past few weeks on suspicion of an arson attack against a Ukrainian-owned business in London, allegedly directed by the Kremlin. Separately, the U.K. has charged six Bulgarian nationals suspected of spying under the direction of the Russian state.\nThe British government cited the spying case when it announced earlier this month what it called a \u201cmajor package of measures to target and dismantle Russian intelligence gathering operations\u201d in the country, including removing the diplomatic premises status of an estate in the country allegedly used by Russian intelligence officers to meet agents.\nAnne Keast-Butler, the head of the cyber and signals intelligence agency GCHQ, said earlier this month that British officials were \u201cincreasingly concerned about growing links between the Russian intelligence services and proxy groups to conduct cyberattacks,\u201d warning that the Kremlin\u2019s partnership with criminal groups was also contributing to \u201csuspected physical surveillance and sabotage operations.\u201d\nAlexander Martin\nis the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device that should be denied by the configured ACL. The reverse condition is also true-traffic that should be permitted could be denied by the configured ACL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACL protections on the affected device, allowing the attacker to access trusted networks that the device might be protecting.\nNote: This vulnerability applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic as well as dual-stack ACL configurations in which both IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs are configured on an interface.\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ogsnsg-aclbyp-3XB8q6jXThis advisory is part of the May 2024 release of the Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: May 2024 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.\n-\nVulnerable Products\nAt the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco products if they were running one of the following Cisco software releases with a vulnerable configuration:\nASA Software releases 9.19.1 to 9.19.1.24, 9.20.1, or 9.20.1.5\n-\nFTD Software releases 7.3.0 to 7.4.0\n-\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software section of this advisory.\nDetermine Whether the Device Has a Vulnerable Configuration\nThis ACL bypass vulnerability is the result of a specific configuration and requires changing an access list from inactive to active. A vulnerable configuration must meet the following conditions:\nThe object group search (OGS) ACL optimization feature is enabled, as shown by the object-group-search access-control command in the running-config example that follows this bulleted list.\n-\nAn access list that is configured as inactive does not have object group network service (NSG)1 but does contain a network object group. In the following example, the network object group is sample1.\n-\nIf the above two conditions are met and the access list is changed from inactive to active, the change does not take effect, and there is no warning to the user. In the following example, the access list is CSM_FW_ACL_.\nIn the following example, which shows a snippet of this configuration, access list CSM_FW_ACL_ would fail to become active, which would result in traffic failing to match that rule.\ndevice# show running-config\n.\n.\n.\nobject-group-search access-control\n.\n.\n.\nobject-group network sample1\nnetwork-object host 192.168.1.2\n.\n.\n.\naccess-group CSM_FW_ACL_ global\n.\n.\n.\naccess-list CSM_FW_ACL_ extended permit ip host 192.168.1.1 object-group sample1 inactive\naccess-group CSM_FW_ACL_ global\n.\n.\n.1. For information about the NSG configuration, see Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Series Command Reference, I - R Commands : object network-service.\nProducts Confirmed Not Vulnerable\nOnly products listed in the Vulnerable Products section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.\nCisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.\n-\nThere is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability. The access list that is not working can be removed and reconfigured to work around this vulnerability. Use the example configuration from the Vulnerable Products section of this advisory to execute the following CLI commands:\ndevice# no access-list CSM_FW_ACL_ extended permit ip host 192.168.1.1 object-group sample1\ndevice# access-list CSM_FW_ACL_ extended permit ip host 192.168.1.1 object-group sample1While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.\n-\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\nCisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker. This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (\u201cFirst Fixed\u201d). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (\u201cCombined First Fixed\u201d).\nTo use the tool, go to the Cisco Software Checker page and follow the instructions.

Drilling a hole into the enclosure would be an option, but decided a touch sensor on the top of the enclosure would be much more elegant \u2014 not to mention better at keeping dirt and moisture out. To bridge the 6.3 mm spacing between the PCB and the top of the enclosure [Daniel] used a small, 7 mm PCB-mounted spring.\nAlthough capacitive sensing works with just about anything that\u2019s electrically conductive, it\u2019s important to get the conductive element as close to the user\u2019s digits as possible. Using a spring here has the advantage that when the enclosure is closed up, the lid will push down onto the spring, which will not only compress slightly, but also provide the best capacitive sensing experience when e.g. the enclosure flexes or warps over time on account of always being pressed against the inside of the lid.\nWhile hardly world-changing, this is another neat design tip when you\u2019re looking to turn more surfaces into touch controls. Just keep in mind that capacitive sensing is notoriously fussy and any trace and spring are also excellent antennae for stray EMI. Nobody likes random capacitive button inputs, after all.\n3 thoughts on \u201cUsing A Spring As A Capacitive Touch Button\u201d\nCapacitive touch for me is one of those \u201cmagic\u201d areas within engineering. I do understand the textbook concept of it, but the practicalities are still obscure\nI\u2019ve seen sticky copper tape with a piece of wire connecting it to the PCB in devices. For people who don\u2019t have such a spring available or don\u2019t want to order/design for one for a single device\u2026\nA few times I\u2019ve just soldered a wire to a penny and hot glued it to the underside of whatever surface I wanted the sensor on.

ICE \u2014 which reported a net revenue of $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2024 \u2014 provides financial technology as well as data services in addition to owning exchanges.\nThe SEC said an investigation revealed that during the incident, ICE immediately knew that a hacker had \u201cinserted malicious code into a VPN device used to remotely access ICE\u2019s corporate network\u201d but did not notify the New York Stock Exchange and other subsidiaries for several days. The delay in reporting not only violated federal regulations, the SEC said, but also ICE\u2019s own procedures.\nThe federal Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (Regulation SCI) rule mandates that cyber intrusions be reported immediately \u2014 unless it is determined that the incident had no or minimal impact on operations.\nAn ICE spokesperson told Recorded Future News that the settlement \u201cinvolves an unsuccessful attempt to access our network more than three years ago.\u201d\n\u201cThe failed incursion had zero impact on market operations. At issue was the timeframe for reporting this type of event under Regulation SCI,\u201d the spokesperson said, sharing a link to statements from two SEC commissioners who similarly criticized the fine.\nGurbir Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, acknowledged that ICE determined that the incident\u2019s significance was minimal but explained that as the owner of the world\u2019s largest stock exchange and a critical player in the world\u2019s financial markets, ICE is \u201csubject to strict reporting requirements when they experience cyber events.\u201d\nICE needed to immediately notify the SEC and the subsidiaries of any cyber intrusion to relevant systems, Grewal said. The incident reporting rules for organizations like ICE are designed so that the SEC can \u201ctake swift steps to protect markets and investors,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHere, the respondents subject to Reg SCI failed to notify the SEC of the intrusion at issue as required. Rather, it was Commission staff that contacted the respondents in the process of assessing reports of similar cyber vulnerabilities,\u201d Grewal said.\n\u201cAs alleged in the order, they instead took four days to assess its impact and internally conclude it was a de minimis event. When it comes to cybersecurity, especially events at critical market intermediaries, every second counts and four days can be an eternity.\u201d\nThe two SEC commissioners who dissented \u2014 Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda \u2014 bashed the fine and said it \u201csuggests to us that the Commission is more concerned with generating large penalties than with ensuring that important market entities address technological vulnerabilities.\u201d\nThey argued that the reporting regulation explicitly mentions that if an affected organization believes the incident had minimal impact, it is allowed to wait before reporting it or not report it at all.\n\u201cEntities covered by Regulation SCI should comply with the rule\u2019s notification requirements and communicate SCI events to the Commission; however, imposing a $10 million civil penalty on ICE for its subsidiaries\u2019 failure to notify the Commission of a single, de minimis incident is an overreaction,\u201d the two said.\n\u201cUnfortunately, this type of response is increasingly common in Commission enforcement actions.\u201d\nGrewal said in his statement that the $10 million penalty \u201cnot only reflect the seriousness of the respondents\u2019 violations, but also that several of them have been the subject of a number of prior SEC enforcement actions, including for violations of Reg SCI.\u201d\nJonathan Greig\nis a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

If you are responsible for securing a large hosting provider network as part of an operations or security team, you know that scanning terabytes of data and millions of PHP files can be a resource intensive task.\nToday we\u2019re announcing Wordfence CLI 4.0.1 which includes a massive scan speed-up of 6X to 30X depending on your workload. This speed increase gives enterprise teams the ability to perform scans for PHP malware on huge volumes of data with the highest available performance. We can confidently say that Wordfence CLI is now the fastest and most thorough PHP malware scanner in the world.\nHow Did We Achieve Up To 30X Speed Increase?\nAt Wordfence, we use a pattern matching system called regular expressions to recognize malware. Our plugin is installed on over 5 million websites and this provides us with a huge surface area to collect malicious samples from our users performing malware scans. We also provide a site-cleaning service via our Wordfence Care and Wordfence Response services, and our analysts are able to collect the newest malware samples from the work they do remediating infected sites.\nThe PHP malware samples we collect are all ingested into our internal threat intelligence platform where we identify emerging threats and develop regular expressions to recognize those threats. These regular expressions (regexes) are deployed to the Wordfence Plugin where the plugin\u2019s malware scanner uses these \u201cscan signatures\u201d to detect the newest malware targeting WordPress. The regexes are also deployed to Wordfence CLI which uses them to detect PHP malware from the command line.\nApproximately two years ago we recognized that an Intel produced product that was open-source at the time, called Hyperscan, could provide a massive speed-up in scan times. Hyperscan supported a subset of the PCRE (Perl compatible regular expressions) syntax we use, so we had to do a significant amount of work to port our PHP malware signatures over to be Hyperscan compatible. We completed that work about a year and a half ago.\nUnfortunately Intel announced that they were changing the license on Hyperscan starting with version 5.5 to essentially make it closed source. Hyperscan also has the limitation that it only runs on Intel CPUs.\nThankfully a team of developers forked the open source version of Hyperscan to create Vectorscan which will continue to develop and release an open source high performance regex scan engine. Additionally, Vectorscan runs on x86 and ARM CPU architectures. Huge kudos to the Vectorscan team for this achievement. Wordfence CLI can use Vectorscan or Hyperscan, depending on which you have installed on your server.\nBoth Vectorscan and the open source version of Hyperscan are available as packages on most popular Linux systems and we include instructions on how to install these dependencies to get the incredible high performance malware scanning that Wordfence CLI provides. If for some reason you\u2019re unable to install Vectorscan or Hyperscan, you can revert to using the PCRE engine, but unfortunately you won\u2019t benefit from a huge performance boost.\nYour Server And Network Configuration Matters\nWith great performance comes one or two caveats \u2013 mainly that your network stack may not be able to keep up. Wordfence CLI with Vectorscan or Hyperscan is blazingly fast and with the speed increase version 4.0.1 provides, it is no longer the bottleneck in many scans.\nWe\u2019ve found that scanning on a server with local SSD drives provides excellent performance. Scanning a server over a network via an NFS mount is perhaps the worst case scenario when it comes to scan bottlenecks. NFS performance can be quite awful and does not do a great job of keeping up with Wordfence CLI performance. So we recommend as far as possible to run your scans on the server where the data resides, allowing your fast CPU to access fast hard-drives via the PCIe bus which is an ideal performance scenario.\nNote that if you have a fleet of say 100 servers all hosting PHP websites, we suggest parallelizing scan operations by having a scheduled job that launches Wordfence CLI on each individual server where it can run locally and access local disk. This gives you the benefit of high performance and parallelization.\nIf you\u2019d like to try out Wordfence CLI on your local machine, I\u2019ve found that I get excellent performance running Ubuntu Linux in a virtual machine on my M1 Macbook, on a large set of test PHP files. Even running within the hypervisor, Wordfence CLI is able to access local disk, and is able to use Vectorscan on the M1 CPU architecture, and provides an unbelievable speedup when you compare it to the PCRE regular expression engine.\nHow To Install Wordfence CLI And Invoke High Speed Scans\nYou can find detailed instructions to install Wordfence CLI on our product page. Some of our packages will automatically install Vectorscan or Hyperscan for you, but in some cases you\u2019ll need to manually install libhyperscan5 or libvectorscan5. On Ubuntu you can do this with the command:\napt install libhyperscan5 (or libvectorscan5)\nTo invoke a scan using Vectorscan/Hyperscan with Wordfence CLI you can use a command like this to scan /usr/local/wordpress/ and all files and directories under that path, recursively:\nwordfence malware-scan --progress --match-engine vectorscan /usr/local/wordpress/\nThe new --match-engine parameter is where you specify \u201cvectorscan\u201d. Note that by default Wordfence CLI still uses the PCRE engine, so you must specify this parameter to activate fast scanning.\nPerformance Matters at Scale\nWordfence CLI is designed for medium to large hosting providers who are hosting WordPress websites and other PHP applications. With this massive performance increase, we\u2019re hoping to make it feasible to increase your scan frequency while reducing the impact of any scan on your operations. Wordfence CLI is free and open source, and a paid license will give you access to our newest PHP malware scan signatures.\nThanks for choosing Wordfence!\nMark Maunder \u2013 Chief Technology Officer at Defiant Inc.\nComments", "hash": "1b3a7b06b20090e62278feb409241f18429f5dbfbda67c23cabdeb7dac3977dd", "id": "ff11f98c-ce73-47c0-b7f5-bf0accbb424a", "link": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2024/05/fast-php-malware-scans-with-wordfence-cli/", "osint_source_id": "3cdad9e3-53f9-4321-8e73-b777104fa7ce", "published": "2024-05-22T15:00:03", "source": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/feed/", "story_id": "24e5f1fd-b2a3-4ee9-9b2c-c948392f0493", "title": "Up to 30X Faster PHP Malware Scans with Wordfence CLI 4.0.1"}], "tags": {"Hyperscan": {"name": "Hyperscan", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Intel": {"name": "Intel", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Mark Maunder": {"name": "Mark Maunder", "tag_type": "PER"}, "PCRE": {"name": "PCRE", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "PHP": {"name": "PHP", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Ubuntu": {"name": "Ubuntu", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Vectorscan": {"name": "Vectorscan", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Wordfence": {"name": "Wordfence", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Wordfence CLI": {"name": "Wordfence CLI", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Up to 30X Faster PHP Malware Scans with Wordfence CLI 4.0.1"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-23T01:10:19.683676", "id": "9ecf90ef-69c7-488c-9510-224099937b3e", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "10"}], "created": "2024-05-22T14:58:08", "id": "dd793fae-22d0-4084-980a-e894e822204d", "news_items": [{"author": "Mayank Parmar", "content": "Windows 11 24H2 now rolling out to Release Preview Insiders\nMay 22, 2024\n-\n02:58 PM\n-\n0\n-\nMicrosoft is rolling out Windows 11 24H2 to testers in the Release Preview Channel, confirming that it is in the final stages of testing.\n\"Today, we are making this year\u2019s annual feature update Windows 11, version 24H2 (Build 26100.712) available in the Release Preview Channel for customers to preview ahead of general availability later this calendar year,\" Microsoft revealed in a recent blog post.\nWindows 11 24H2 Build 26100.712 is the third big feature update for the operating system after 22H2.

These languages offer broader capabilities and are better suited for modern web development and automation tasks,\" said Microsoft program manager Naveen Shankar.\n\"Beginning with the new OS release slated for later this year, VBScript will be available as features on demand (FODs). The feature will be completely retired from future Windows OS releases, as we transition to the more efficient PowerShell experiences,\" said Microsoft program manager Naveen Shankar.\nMicrosoft's deprecation plan consists of three phases. The first phase will begin in the second half of 2024, with VBScript enabled by default as an optional feature in Windows 11 24H2.\nDuring the second phase, which will start around 2027, VBScript will still be available as an on-demand feature but will no longer be pre-installed.\nVBScript will be retired and eliminated from future versions of Windows as part of phase three of the deprecation process. As a result, all VBScript dynamic link libraries (.dll files) will be removed, and projects that use VBScript will stop functioning.\nThe company first revealed in October that it would kill off VBScript (also known as Visual Basic Script or Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition) in Windows after 30 years of availability as a system component.\nThis programming language comes bundled with Internet Explorer (disabled on some Windows 10 versions in February 2023) and helps automate tasks and control applications using Windows Script.\nMicrosoft disabled VBScript by default in Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 10 with the July 2019 Patch Tuesday cumulative updates.\nThis move is part of a broader strategy to remove Windows and Office features threat actors use as attack vectors to infect users with malware.\nAttackers have also used VBScript in malware campaigns, delivering strains like Lokibot, Emotet, Qbot, and, more recently, DarkGate malware.\nThis effort traces back to 2018 when Redmond extended support for its Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) to Office 365 client applications, thus curbing attacks that utilized Office VBA macros.\nSince then, Microsoft has also disabled Excel 4.0 (XLM) macros, mandated default blocking of VBA Office macros, introduced XLM macro protection, and began blocking untrusted XLL add-ins by default across Microsoft 365 tenants worldwide.\nComments\njmwoods - 1 hour ago\nFinally.", "hash": "698c0c49d59f2781030a0a2f5e4bcee90339cd4167685acbda39317ec03cef8c", "id": "982eafdb-34f7-41fd-a64d-b54c9904ab9c", "link": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-to-start-killing-off-vbscript-in-second-half-of-2024/", "osint_source_id": "113d33c5-3471-4d83-bd72-2ea6658a4e49", "published": "2024-05-22T14:34:38", "source": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/feed/", "story_id": "8559ccfc-6852-49ca-bf43-933fd04fe20b", "title": "Microsoft to start killing off VBScript in second half of 2024"}], "tags": {"Hyper-V": {"name": "Hyper-V", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "JavaScript": {"name": "JavaScript", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Linux": {"name": "Linux", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Lokibot": {"name": "Lokibot", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Naveen Shankar": {"name": "Naveen Shankar", "tag_type": "PER"}, "PowerShell": {"name": "PowerShell", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Redmond": {"name": "Redmond", "tag_type": "PER"}, "VBScript": {"name": "VBScript", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Windows": {"name": "Windows", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Windows 10": {"name": "Windows 10", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Windows 11": {"name": "Windows 11", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Windows OS": {"name": "Windows OS", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Windows Script": {"name": "Windows Script", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Microsoft to start killing off VBScript in second half of 2024"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-22T17:16:02.108801", "id": "8d1f02bc-92c1-4867-b29b-0ccecfc42771", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "4"}], "created": "2024-05-22T14:15:30", "id": "658cea06-978a-41e9-9887-c09f4da96d15", "news_items": [{"author": "Industry News", "content": "Strike Graph VerifyAI gives businesses flexibility and control for audits\nStrike Graph launches VerifyAI, an innovative AI-powered technology for intelligent testing that goes beyond basic security control automation to understand the nuances of your business.\nSecurity audits, a necessary burden for businesses, require an AI that excels at managing information sensitivity with the strictest measures while adapting to each client\u2019s unique compliance program.\nVerifyAI delivers real-time feedback on continuous compliance, allowing customers peace of mind knowing all evidence has been verified.

However, with SMD parts getting smaller and smaller, some kind of microscope is almost a necessity.\nLuckily, you can get USB microscopes for a song now. If you\u2019re willing to spend a little more, you can get even get microscopes that have little LCD screens. However, there are some problems with the cheaper end of these microscopes.\nMany of them have small and wobbly stands that aren\u2019t very practical. Some don\u2019t leave you much room to get a soldering iron in between the lens and the part. Worse still, many cheap microscopes have trouble staying still when you have to push buttons or otherwise make adjustments to the device.\nIt seems like every time a new generation of microscopes aimed at the electronics market arrives on the scene, many of the earlier flaws get taken care of. That\u2019s certainly the case with the Andonstar AD409-Max.\nSum of its Parts\nWhile the microscope looks a lot like many other Andonstar microscopes and, indeed, a lot of similar devices, you\u2019ll immediately notice the work area under the microscope is huge and covered with a silicone work mat. We\u2019ve put together a short video about the microscope that you can find bellow, followed by the promotional video from Andonstar themselves. That video will happily point out the positive things. Of course, there are a few negatives.\nAs mentioned in our video, the microscope is built solid and works very well. However, you can\u2019t help but feel it is a hodgepodge of separate parts. The lights, for example, have their own switch. So does the endoscope. The camera itself has a WiFi hotspot (it won\u2019t connect to your network, however). But when you load the phone app to download pictures and videos, you realize that the microscope thinks it\u2019s a dashcam. The endoscope, with its little focus knob at the back, also seems like something of an afterthought.\nThese disparate parts lead to having a lot of wires. Of course you can easily 3D print some wire management clips or even use some zip ties to do it yourself. But the whole package would be a bit more impressive if the integration was better.\nThere are two mount points on the lens, one near each end of the lens body. We know some people like to mount at the bottom to get extra working distance, but you don\u2019t really need to do that here. That mount is actually made for a ring light if you want to add one. The microscope might not be as stable as it will be when you use the mount closer to the electronics. However, do use one of the mounts. If you screw the ring in the middle of the lens body, you won\u2019t be able to turn the lens to focus.\nThe Good News\nThis isn\u2019t the end of the world, though. The images look great, and there is a ton of room between the lens and the work surface. The video mentions \u201cnearly two feet\u201d of room. In retrospect, it is closer to 18 inches, depending on how much magnification you want.\nStill, that\u2019s plenty of space to work on things. What\u2019s more is that, unlike some microscopes, there is a filter protecting the lens from solder fumes and heat. That and the silicone mat make it clear the microscope was made for soldering.\nThe lights are very bright. In fact, if you get what you want out of the light, it becomes very difficult to see. Unlike a ring light, you can adjust the gooseneck lamps to get just the right angle on whatever you need to see.\nThe microscope is well-packed and has a reasonable manual that seems mostly correct. There are several attachments for the endoscope, ranging from a short plastic tube to a little mirror for looking under things. If the screen is too small, you can always connect an HDMI monitor. All the required cables come in the box along with a USB power adapter.\nPutting it to Work\nThere are less expensive alternatives out there. You could, of course, add a larger base to a cheaper unit. You may not really need the endoscope, the helping hands, and the tool holder. But if you don\u2019t mind the roughly $450 price tag, this is a very serviceable soldering and inspection microscope.\nMost of the issues are minor, like the cable management. For another example, despite the manual saying you can save default settings, it doesn\u2019t seem to work. It would be nice if you could hot-swap the memory card, but you can\u2019t. WiFi is a nice thought, but having to disconnect from your normal WiFi to connect to the microscope isn\u2019t that convenient.\nBut for the main features, it works well. Sure, some people really like a binocular microscope. They, like anything else, have plusses and minuses, too. Do you have a favorite microscope or other magnifying device for soldering? Or are you lucky enough to have eagle-eye vision? If you do, just wait\u2026 you\u2019ll see. Parts are getting smaller every year and your eyes seem to get worse every year, too.\nThe video below shows a little bit of soldering of the SMD challenge board that we use every year at Supercon. Having a microscope is, of course, cheating, but at least we didn\u2019t use a nice soldering iron just to be a little fair to everyone who\u2019s had to use our terrible setup in the past.\nYou could mount a commercial ring light on the lower lens mount, or why not roll your own? You might not need as many upgrades for this rig as you would for a cheaper microscope.\n4 thoughts on \u201cHands On: AD409-Max Microscope\u201d\nThe linked manufacturer refers to this product as including an endoscope. When exactly did the word \u201cendoscope\u201d get coopted by the electronics industry? I recall these camera-on-a-cord devices as fiber-scopes Because endoscopes have historically indicated a medical device. At-home colonoscopy anyone?\nStreams have historically indicated with continuously body of flowing water, but now it means continuously transferred data too. Language changes over time.\nMaybe I need a microscope buying guide. I\u2019m guessing you wouldn\u2019t have bothered to review it if it was grossly overpriced. But I don\u2019t really understand what this over the $35 and $50 ones that is worth the extra $400.\nHaving seen both sides of the spectrum, it usually comes down to optics and working distance (both can make or break a microscope when used for soldering). There are also a few bells and whistles that while not necessary are really useful, like removable polarizer filters and hdmi output so you can connect a monitor. Also I\u2019d spend a little more for a rigid metal base and stand, way better than faffing with plastic.\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Mai 2024 vorgestellten \"Copilot+PC\" Konzept macht Microsoft zwar das n\u00e4chste gro\u00dfe Fass (Hardware mit AI-Support und Copilot) auf. Aber ich bin mich nicht so sicher, ob der Schuss nicht nach hinten los geht. Sicherheitsforscher laufen Sturm gegen die \"Recall\"-Funktion, die st\u00e4ndig Screenshots von allem, was auf dem System passiert, machen und per AI auswerten lassen soll. Derweil hat die EU-Kommission eine Untersuchung gegen Microsoft eingeleitet, und will wissen, ob die Sicherheitsanforderungen mit Blick auf AI-Risiken eingehalten werden. Hier ein Blick auf diese Gemengelage.\nAnzeige\nWird Recall zum Sicherheitsdesaster?\nIn Teil 1 (Microsofts AI-PC mit Copilot \u2013 KI-Informationssplitter) hatte ich das von Microsoft vorgestellte \"Copilot+PC\" Konzept thematisiert und am Rande die sogenannte Recall-Funktion erw\u00e4hnt. Diese erm\u00f6glicht es Windows, st\u00e4ndig Screenshots vom Bildschirm des Benutzers zu machen und ein generatives KI-Modell zu verwenden, um die Daten zu verarbeiten und sie durchsuchbar zu machen. Das ist dann die ultimative Wanze in jedem PC. Bewog Elon Musk zur Empfehlung, dass die Nutzer auf Linux wechseln sollen.\nSatya Nadella, Chef von Microsoft, sagte zwar w\u00e4hrend eines Interviews, wo er die AI-PCs vorstellte und nach den Bedenken der Menschen bez\u00fcglich dieser Recall- Funktion gefragt wurde: \"Man muss zwei Dinge zusammenbringen. Das ist mein Computer, das ist mein Recall, und das wird alles lokal gemacht. Das ist also das Versprechen. Das ist einer der Gr\u00fcnde, warum Recall wie eine magische Sache funktioniert, denn ich kann darauf vertrauen, dass es auf meinem Computer ist.\"\nBenutzer sollen die Funktion Recall auch davon abhalten k\u00f6nnen, Screenshots zu machen, falls sie um ihre Privatsph\u00e4re besorgt sind oder die Funktion nicht nutzen wollen. Martin Geu\u00df hat in diesem Artikel mal die technische Dokumentation zu Recall verlinkt, in der Microsoft viel von \"Privacy\" erz\u00e4hlt. Martin schreibt, dass Recall alle f\u00fcnf Sekunden einen Screenshot aufnimmt und abspeichert. Und nach der Ersteinrichtung von Windows sei Recall standardm\u00e4\u00dfig eingeschaltet.\nvx-underground, die sich mit Ransomware und Sicherheit befassen, haben es in obigem Tweet auf den Punkt gebracht: \"Microsoft f\u00fchrt eine 24/7-\u00dcberwachungsfunktion f\u00fcr die NSA und/oder CIA ein, vermarktet sie aber als eine Funktion, die den Leuten gefallen wird\". Im Tweet ist das Interview von Nadella verlinkt. Und Sicherheitsforscher Kevin Beaumont zerrei\u00dft in einer Reihe Tweets das Konzept von Recall als das d\u00fcmmste, was es jemals gegeben habe.\nAktuell w\u00fcrde InfoStealer-Malware die gespeicherten Kennw\u00f6rter der Nutzer speichern. K\u00fcnftig sei CoPilot Recall die \"Malware\", die alles stiehlt, was der Nutzer jemals am Rechner eingegeben oder angesehen habe, und das dann in einer bereits angelegten Datenbank speichert. Es reicht, einfach die Recall-Datenbank anstatt nur die lokale Browser-Passwortdatenbank, abzuziehen, um auf die Kronjuwelen zuzugreifen. Finanzdaten, Chats usw. liegen offen herum und sind sehr wertvoll.\nBeaumont hat diesen Beitrag auf Double-Pulsar ver\u00f6ffentlicht und zeigt, wie Microsoft die Sicherheit von Windows mit Recall unterminiert. In obigem Tweet spielt Beaumont mit dem Satz \"Earlier this month, the person who demo'd this wrote in a memo to staff \"If you're faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority: do security\"\" auf das Versprechen Microsofts an, k\u00fcnftig Sicherheit ernst zu nehmen (siehe Microsoft macht ab sofort Security zur Top Priorit\u00e4t).\nAnzeige\nWie meint Kevin Beaumont: \"Danke, Microsoft, dass Sie b\u00f6swilligen Hackern den Weg ebnen.\" und gibt auf X an, dass ein einfacher PowerShell-Befehl reicht, um Recall wieder einzuschalten. Und in diesem Tweet schreibt Beaumont dass der Copilot+Recall jetzt in Microsoft Intune global aktiviert sei, wenn man ein Copilot+-kompatibles Ger\u00e4t verwendet. Nutzer m\u00fcssen die Funktion manuell in den Benutzereinstellungen deaktivieren (siehe auch).\nAuch von Malwarebytes wird in einem Tweet auf die Gefahren von Recall hingewiesen, da alles aufgezeichnet wird. Mitja Kolsek von ACROS Security schreibt in einem Tweet \"Etwas sagt mir, dass @0patch [etwas f\u00fcr] viele Kunden haben wird, die f\u00fcr immer bei Windows 10 bleiben wollen.\" ACROS Security bietet ja ein Micropatching f\u00fcr Windows an, so dass das Betriebssystem Windows 10 nach dem offiziellen Supportende von Windows 10 sicher betrieben werden kann.\nElon Musk hatte ja auf Linux hingewiesen (siehe oben). In diesem Tweet meint jemand, dass \"der letzte Winkelzug von Microsoft ein guter Grund sei, Windows abzuschreiben. Wechseln Sie zu macOS (es sei denn, Apple plant auch diesen Wahnsinn) oder Linux\" hei\u00dft es auch dort. Microsoft habe die Orientierung verloren und man k\u00fcmmert sich nicht mehr um die Sicherheit oder Privatsph\u00e4re ihrer Nutzer.\nUnd Sven Herbig meint in diesem Tweet: \"Von 'Sicherheit wird oberste Priorit\u00e4t' zu 'unsere Software wird Spionage und \u00dcberwachung auf ein neues Level heben' in unter einem Monat. Sportlich, Microsoft.\"\nEU schaut bei Microsoft Bing genauer hin\nDie EU-Kommission hat ein rechtsverbindlichen Auskunftsersuchen an Microsoft gegen deren Suchmaschine Bing gestellt. Es geht um Ausk\u00fcnfte bez\u00fcglich spezifischer Risiken bei CoPilot (basiert auf ChatGPT) in Bezug auf den Digital Service Act (DSA). heise hat das Ganz beispielsweise in diesem Beitrag aufbereitet.\nUnd Techcrunch weist hier darauf hin, dass Microsoft eine Millionen-Strafe droht, wenn die gegen den DSA versto\u00dfen. Hintergrund ist, dass die EU-Kommission bereits im M\u00e4rz 2024 von Microsoft und einer Reihe anderer Tech-Giganten Informationen \u00fcber systemische Risiken, die von generativen KI-Tools ausgehen, angefertigt habe. Letzten Freitag (17.5.) erkl\u00e4rte die Kommission, Microsoft habe einige der angeforderten Dokumente nicht vorgelegt. In einer aktualisierten Version der Pressemitteilung der Kommission wurde jedoch die Formulierung ge\u00e4ndert und die fr\u00fchere Behauptung, die EU habe keine Antwort von Microsoft erhalten, gestrichen. In der \u00fcberarbeiteten Fassung hei\u00dft es, dass die EU die Durchsetzungsma\u00dfnahmen \"im Anschluss an ein erstes Auskunftsersuchen\" versch\u00e4rft. Die Kommission habe Microsoft eine Frist bis zum 27. Mai gesetzt, um die angeforderten Daten zu \u00fcbermitteln, hei\u00dft es. Da dr\u00e4ut noch was.\nCopilot als Sicherheitsrisiko\nIn diesem Kontext sind auch auch einige Informationen ganz aufschlussreich, die mir ein Leser bereits Ende April 2024 per Mail zukommen lie\u00df. \u00dcber den Radiobeitrag \"KI als Hacker \u2013 Verbreiten Chatbots fiese Computerviren?\" vom 18.04.2024 ist der Leser auf dem Angriffsvektor \"Prompt Injection\" aufmerksam geworden. Der lokal auf dem eigenen Computer laufende Copilot kann durch gezielte Prompt Injection dazu verleitet werden, dass er die eigenen Daten preisgibt/versendet, wenn man auf eine pr\u00e4parierte Internetseite st\u00f6\u00dft. Diese sch\u00e4dliche Webseite ist mit Anweisungen gef\u00fcttert, die vom Copilot lokal ausgef\u00fchrt werden.\nDer Leser hat die Internetseite \"Who Am I? Conditional Prompt Injection Attacks with Microsoft Copilot\" vom 02.03.2024 verlinkt, die sich mit der Thematik befasst. Microsoft ist sich der Probleme bewusst, wie man dem Techcommunity-Beitrag \"Azure AI announces Prompt Shields for Jailbreak and Indirect prompt injection attacks\" vom 28.03.2024 und dem Artikel \"Microsoft doesn't want you to use prompt injection attacks to trick Copilot AI into spiraling out of control, and it now has the tool to prevent this\" vom 01.04.2024 entnehmen kann. In seinen FAQs wie hier schwurbelt Microsoft um eine Antwort herum.\nWeitere AI-Splitter\nWas ich von der hier aufgegriffenen Warnung von KI-Koryph\u00e4en vor k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz halten soll, wei\u00df ich ehrlich gesagt nicht. Man h\u00f6rt dies, man h\u00f6rt das. Derweil gehen OpenAI einige K\u00f6pfe, die f\u00fcr die Sicherheit der AI-Modelle zust\u00e4ndig waren, von der Fahne. In diesem Wired-Beitrag hei\u00dft es, dass das Team bei OpenAI, das sich mit den existenziellen Gefahren der KI befasste, aufgel\u00f6st habe. Die Leute haben entweder gek\u00fcndigt oder sind in anderen Forschungsgruppen aufgegangen. Jan Leike hat in einer Reihe von Tweets seinen Webgang von OpenAI erkl\u00e4rt. Keine guten Aussichten. Golem widmet sich in diesem Artikel dem Thema.\nStack Overflow k\u00e4mpft mit dem Deal, den sie mit OpenAI eingegangen sind, um die Inhalte der Nutzer Trainingszwecke bereitzustellen. Jetzt sabotieren Nutzer bei Stack Overflow ihre Postings, um diese Daten unbrauchbar f\u00fcr eine Verwendung durch OpenAI zu machen. Der n\u00e4chste \u00c4rger k\u00f6nnte hier drohen, da OpenAI ein Abkommen geschlossen hat, um Reddit-Inhalte auf ChatGPT zu bringen.\nUnd Google-Nutzer sind von den AI-gest\u00fctzten Suchergebnisse gefrustet, wie ich k\u00fcrzlich bei Bleeping Computer las. Es geht um KI-\u00dcbersichten, auch bekannt als \"Search Generative Experience\". Das ist Googles neue Suchfunktion, die Webinhalte mithilfe der hauseigenen LLM (Large Language Models) zusammenfasst. Laut Google sollen die KI-\u00dcbersichten nur dann angezeigt werden, wenn die Suchmaschine der Meinung ist, dass sie einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Nutzen als herk\u00f6mmliche Links bieten. Seit Google dieses Feature aktiviert hat, haben viele Nutzer versucht, diese Funktion, wegen der h\u00e4ufigen falschen Ergebnis, zu deaktivieren. Das geht nicht.\nAch ja, dass BSI hat eine Brosch\u00fcre Einfluss von KI auf die ver\u00f6ffentlicht. Das sind nur einige Informationsh\u00e4ppchen rund um das Thema \"k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz\", die mir in den letzten Tagen unter die Augen kamen.\nAbschlie\u00dfende Gedanken\n\u00dcberblicke ich mal die beiden Artikel (Teil 1 und Teil 2) meiner AI-Serie, kann ich mich des Eindrucks nicht erwehren, dass das Ganze AI-Zeugs halbfertig auf die Anwender geworfen wird und sich alles in die falsche Richtung entwickelt. Privatsph\u00e4re und Sicherheit scheinen Nebensache zu sein. Interessant fang ich das Thema Copilot+PC und Recall. Erste Artikel in US-Medien waren unkritische Lobeshymnen. Aber seit gestern mehren sich die kritischen Stimmen, die von einem \"geht gar nicht\" ausgehen.\nEs wird nun spannend, ob Microsoft mit diesem Schwenk richtig ins Klo gegriffen hat \u2013 oder es es genug Lemminge gibt, die auf diese Entwicklung h\u00fcpfen. Aus meiner Sicht sind die \"DSGVO-Schlachten\" rund um die Windows-Telemetrie oder Microsoft Office 365 nur ein laues L\u00fcftchen gegen den Sturm, der sich mit den jetzt vorgestellten AI-L\u00f6sungen zusammen braut. M\u00f6glicherweise hat Nadella Microsoft in die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Krise seit dem Weggang von Steve Ballmer gef\u00fchrt. Bei der Sicherheit brennt sinnbildlich die H\u00fctte und Microsoft steht mit dem R\u00fccken zur Wand. Statt umzusteuern gibt es Lippenbekenntnisse und jetzt gie\u00dft man, zumindest gef\u00fchlt, mit der Recall-Funktion noch Bandbeschleuniger ins Feuer. Das kann nur schief gehen \u2013 w\u00e4re sch\u00f6n, wenn ich mich t\u00e4usche.\n\u00c4hnliche Artikel:\nMicrosofts AI-PC mit Copilot \u2013 KI-Informationssplitter \u2013 Teil 1\nMicrosofts Sicherheitsrisiko Recall, OpenAI und weitere KI-Informationssplitter \u2013 Teil 2\nCookies blockieren entzieht uns die Finanzierung: Cookie-Einstellungen\nVielen Dank f\u00fcr diese Zusammenfassung!\nDa Microsoft bisher keine wirklich gute Desktopsuche in all den Jahrzehnten zusammengebracht hat, kann ich mir kaum vorstellen, dass sie diese KI Daten performant durchsuchen k\u00f6nnen. Auch nicht mit KI Chip. Ich zumindest \u00e4rgere mich immer wieder gr\u00fcn und blau \u00fcber die Suche im Explorer, oft habe ich Files schneller mit den Augen entdeckt als die Suche. wenn ich mir da zB Recoll (nicht zu verwechseln mit Recall) in Linux ansehe, das ist eine Suche die funktioniert.\nAbgesehen vom Durchsuchen der angesammelten Daten. Ich verstehe beim besten Willen nicht, warum man alle 5 Sekunden Screenshots macht und diese dann einer KI lehrt. Viel zweckm\u00e4\u00dfiger w\u00e4re es doch die eigentlichen Steuerungen zu trainieren. Was wird eingegeben, was klickt die Maus an usw.. MS ist doch der Betriebsystemhersteller \u2013 die haben doch jeglichen Zugriff auf das API. Stattdessen machen sie einen Screenshot und wollen dann alles per OCR und einer Anything artigen Erkennung die Zusammenh\u00e4nge erkennen k\u00f6nnen? F\u00fcr mich h\u00f6rt sich das an, als h\u00e4tte hier eine Forschungsgruppe, eines der neueren Modelle hergenommen, das Bilder interpretieren kann (Name ist mir gerade entfallen \u2013 aber es gibt so eines in das MS auch verstrickt ist) und wendet das einfach auf den Screenshot an. Dieses Modell analysiert dann einfach was es erkennt. Was dabei rauskommt, wei\u00df wahrscheinlich noch niemand so genau \u2013 aber man stopft das dann mal in eine gpt artiges Modell hinein. Man probiert halt einmal was das bringt. Die Hardware l\u00e4sst man sich von den beta-Usern zahlen und die Tests werden kostenlos von denselben Usern durchgef\u00fchrt. Vielleicht tue ich da unrecht und es gab hier schon jahrelange Tests, aber angesichts der Modelle die ein solches System ben\u00f6tigt \u2013 denke ich eher dass es maximal 1/2 -1 Jahr an einem solches Konzept gebaut werden kann. Getestet kann das kaum wenige Monate worden sein, wenn \u00fcberhaupt. Wof\u00fcr man das ganze verwenden kann ist wahrscheinlich noch ziemlich unklar.\nDie Suche im Windows Explorer ist seit Microsoft Search 4.0 (war optional bei XP) kaputt.\nSeit dem \u00e4rgert mich die st\u00e4ndig, weil Suchmuster hartn\u00e4ckig ignoriert werden und so die meisten Ergebnisse schlicht falsch sind.\nOft findet die Suche nicht einmal Dateien, die dem Suchmuster entprechen und sogar im aktiven Ordner sichtbar sind.\nWenn ich z.B. *123.doc als Suchmuster eingebe, bekomme ich als Treffer auch z.B. Dateien, die 123abc.doc oder abc123456.doc hei\u00dfen. Diese Treffer entsprechen NICHT dem Suchmuster und sind daher falsch!\nZudem ist die Kombination von Suchkriterien mit der aktuellen Suchfunktion unn\u00f6tig kompliziert bis unm\u00f6glich.\nSuche mal eine Datei *123.doc, die zwischen 1.2.2020 und 1.3.2020 gespeichert wurde und zwischen 100 und 200 kb gro\u00df ist.\nUnter XP kein Problem.\nIch benutze daher ein Tool, das die Suchfunktion von Windows XP bietet.\nUnd das findet nur Dateien, die tats\u00e4chlich dem Suchmuster entsprechen und es ist zudem, obwohl es ohne Indizierung arbeitet, deutlich schneller als die Windows-eigene Suche.\nAuf Fremdrechnern benutze ich zur Suche die Eingabeaufforderung.\nWas die Recall-Funktion angeht:\nMan stelle sich vor, man schaut einen Porno auf dem Rechner und danach ein Werbevideo f\u00fcr ein Auto.\nWas w\u00fcrde die KI daraus zusammenfabulieren?\nDas man gerne Pornos, die im Auto statt finden, schaut?\nUnd wie schon geschrieben:\nDa das Recall st\u00e4ndig Snapshots macht, macht es auch Snapshots, wenn man sich irgendwo einloggt, d.h. es loggt dann die Accountdaten mit.\nUnd das Zeugs mu\u00df ja auch gespeichert werden.\nD.H., man braucht echt gro\u00dfe Festplatten.\nDiese Recall-Funktion ist der feuchte Traum jedes Geheimdienstmitarbeiters und auch neugierigen Chefs.\nAuf Firmen-PCs d\u00fcrfte die Funktion arge arbeitsrechtliche Probleme verursachen.\nDenn das w\u00e4re eine anlasslose \u00dcberwachung der Mitarbeiter.\nUnd die ist gesetzlich verboten!\nIMHO ist auch das schlichte Vorhandensein so einer Funktion gesetzlich verboten, auch wenn die abgeschaltet ist.\nD.H. Windows mit dieser Funktion ist nicht arbeitsrechtskonform in Firmen einsetzbar.\nAusnahme d\u00fcrfte wohl nur die Kamera\u00fcberwachung in Verk\u00e4ufsr\u00e4umen o.\u00c4. sein.\nAber die dient ja nicht der Mitarbeiter\u00fcberwachung, sondern der Feststellung von Ladendiebst\u00e4hlen o.\u00c4.\nZu Microsoft recall : Wow \u2013 Neben der ganzen berechtigten Kritik und Diskussion zum Thema Security + Data Governance\u2026 Selbst Ressourcen schlagen f\u00fcr \"normale\" B\u00fcroarbeitspl\u00e4tze schon ins Gewicht (Sekund\u00e4rlinks von oben):\nNeben Strom f\u00fcr Nutzung kommen f\u00fcr einen normalen Arbeitsplatz selbst die Kosten f\u00fcr das Backupstorage \u2026 Ich w\u00fcrde sofort die Einstellungen zum deaktivieren nutzen:\n\"\u2026die Recall-Funktion, die st\u00e4ndig Screenshots von allem, was auf dem System passiert, machen und per AI auswerten lassen soll.\"\nWas soll der K\u00e4se?

"content": "State hackers turn to massive ORB proxy networks to evade detection\nIonut Ilascu\nMay 22, 2024\n-\n01:37 PM\n-\n0\n-\nSecurity researchers are warning that China-linked state-backed hackers are increasingly relying on a vast proxy server network created from virtual private servers and compromised online devices for cyberespionage operations.\nCalled operational relay box (ORBs) networks, these proxy meshes are administered by independent cybercriminals that provide access to multiple state-sponsored actors (APTs).\nORBs are similar to botnets but they may be a hybrid of commercially leased VPS services and compromised devices, including end-of-life routers and other IoT products.\nThe growing use of ORBs by adversaries comes with challenges in both detection and attribution as the attack infrastructure is no longer controlled by the threat actor, who can cycle through nodes distributed over a broad geography.\nMalicious proxy networks\nCybersecurity firm Mandiant has been tracking multiple ORBs, two of them used by advanced threat actors known for espionage and intellectual theft operations linked to China.\nOne of them called ORB3/SPACEHOP is described as \u201ca very active network leveraged by multiple China-nexus threat actors, including APT5 and APT15\u201d for reconnaissance and vulnerability exploitation.\nFor instance, SPACEHOP was used in December 2022 to exploit CVE-2022-27518, a critical vulnerability in Citrix ADC and Gateway, which the National Security Agency (NSA) linked to APT5 (a.k.a. Manganese, Mulberry Typhoon, Bronze Fleetwood, Keyhole Panda, and UNC2630).\nMandiant researchers say that SPACEHOP is a provisioned network that uses a relay server hosted in Hong Kong or China by a cloud provider. It installs an open-source command and control (C2) framework that allows managing downstream nodes.\nThe relay nodes are typically cloned Linux-based images and their role is to proxy malicious traffic to an exit node that communicates with targeted victim environments.\nBy contrast, ORB2/FLORAHOX is a hybrid network that consists of an Adversary Controlled Operations Server (ACOS), compromised connected devices (routers and IoT), and VPS services that run the traffic through TOR and multiple hacked routers.\nThe researchers believe that this mesh is \u201cused in cyber espionage campaigns by a diverse set of China-nexus threat actors\u201d to obfuscate the traffic from the source.\nThe network appears to contain several subnetworks composed of compromised devices recruited by the router implant FLOWERWATER as well as other router-based payloads.\nAlthough ORB2/FLORAHOX is used by multiple threat actors, Mandiant says that trusted third-party sources have reported clusters of activity attributed to China-linked adversaries APT31/Zirconium that focus on intellectual property theft.\n\u201cORB2 represents a more complicated design including the relay of traffic through TOR nodes, provisioned VPS servers, and different types of compromised routers including CISCO, ASUS, and Draytek end-of-life devices\u201d - Mandiant\nApart from FLOWERWATER, the researchers say that additional payloads and tools (MIPS router tunneler PETALTOWER, SHIMMERPICK bash scripts) are used to navigate the ORB2 network and pre-existing nodes based on command-line inputs.\nRegardless of the type of devices used, an ORB network has a set of essential components that allow it to work properly:\nAdversary Controlled Operations Server (ACOS) - server for administering nodes in an ORB network\n-\nRelay node - lets users authenticate to the network and relay traffic through the larger traversal pool on ORB nodes\n-\nTraversal nodes - the main nodes composing an ORB network, obfuscate the origin of the traffic\n-\nExit/Staging nodes - used to launch attacks on targets\n-\nVictim server: victim infrastructure communicating with the node on the ORB network\n-\nEnterprise defense challenges\nThe use of ORBs has been observed in the past, the most prominent recent example being the Volt Typhoon attacks on US critical infrastructure organizations using SOHO network equipment (e.g. routers, firewalls, and VPN appliances).\nBecause of how malicious ORBs function, they provide stealth, resilience, and independence from the internet infrastructure in a country.\nMultiple threat actors use these network infrastructures for limited periods, which impacts tracking them and attribution.\nAccording to Mandiant, the lifespan of an IPv4 address of an ORB node can be as short as 31 days. This appears to be a feature of ORB network contractors in China, who can \u201ccycle significant percentages of their compromised or leased infrastructure on a monthly basis.\u201d\nDefenders can miss malicious traffic from these networks because ORB administrators use Autonomous System Number (ASN) providers in various parts of the world.\nApart from making them more reliable, this also allows adversaries to target enterprises from devices in close geographic proximity, which raises less suspicions when analyzing traffic.\n\u201cOne such example would be traffic from a residential ISP that is in the same geographic location as the target that is regularly used by employees and would be less likely to get picked up for manual review\u201d - Mandiant\nWith attackers increasingly using ORBs, protecting enterprise environments becomes even more difficult since detection becomes more complex, attribution is more complicated, and indicators for adversary infrastructure are less useful for defenders.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

Damit die Entwicklung schneller voranschreitet, sucht man die Expertise der US Navy.\nWas ist eine Railgun?\nDie Railgun funktioniert \u00e4hnlich wie ein Katapult. Ein Schlitten l\u00e4uft zwischen 2 Schienen \u2013 daher auch der Name Railgun (rail = Schiene). Eine Schiene ist positiv, die andere negativ geladen. Durch den stromleitenden Schlitten wird der Kreislauf zwischen den beiden Schienen geschlossen.\nDadurch entsteht ein Magnetfeld. Dies erzeugt Lorentzkraft, bei der ein Magnetfeld Kraft auf bewegte Ladungen aus\u00fcbt. Der Schlitten wird dadurch beschleunigt, entgegen der Richtung der Energiequelle, also hin zur M\u00fcndung der Railgun. Das Projektil auf dem Schlitten wird dadurch mit extrem hoher Geschwindigkeit weggeschossen.\nVorteile von Railguns:\nMehr als die 10-fache Reichweite eines normalen Gesch\u00fctzes\n-\nGelenktes Railgun-Projektil kostet weniger als 20 Prozent einer Rakete\n-\nPlatz- und Gewichtsersparnis bei der Munition: Treibladungen f\u00fcr Granaten/Geschosse sind nicht mehr notwendig\n-\nNachteile von Railguns:\nHohe Hitze beim Schie\u00dfen besch\u00e4digt Schienen und andere Bauteile und reduziert so die Haltbarkeit\n-\nLeistungsstarke Railguns sind noch zu gro\u00df, um sie mobil einsetzen zu k\u00f6nnen\n-\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Was ist eine Railgun?\nWie die Japan Times berichtet, wurde ein Vertreter der ATLA (Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency) in die USA geschickt. Diese untersteht dem japanischen Verteidigungsministerium und ist f\u00fcr die Entwicklung und Beschaffung neuer Milit\u00e4rtechnologien f\u00fcr Japan zust\u00e4ndig, sowie f\u00fcr R\u00fcstungskooperationen mit Universit\u00e4ten und nationalen sowie internationalen Unternehmen. Das \u00f6sterreichische Gegenst\u00fcck dazu ist ARWT - Amt f\u00fcr R\u00fcstung und Wehrtechnik.\nDer Vertreter der ATLA wird sich in den USA mit Expert*innen der US Navy austauschen. Die Navy arbeitete \u00fcber 10 Jahre an Railguns und gab daf\u00fcr mehr als 500 Millionen US-Dollar aus. Das Projekt wurde aber 2021 aufgegeben. Dennoch soll diese lange Erfahrung bei der Entwicklung dabei helfen, Japans Railgun-Projekt voranzutreiben, das 2016 begonnen wurde.\nDas Ziel des Informationsaustausches ist es, dass Japans Railgun m\u00f6glichst rasch einsatzf\u00e4hig wird. Dazu wird der ATLA-Vertreter im Juni mit Personen reden, die direkt an der Entwicklung der Navy-Railgun beteiligt waren. Au\u00dferdem werden die Einrichtungen besucht, an denen die Railgun entwickelt und getestet wurde.

Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und Formfaktor davon passen eher in die aktuelle Zeit. Eine solche Railgun k\u00f6nnte etwa die \u00fcblichen 76mm-Gesch\u00fctze auf Fregatten, Korvetten und Zerst\u00f6rern ersetzen.\nDie US-Railgun h\u00e4tte aufgrund ihrer Gr\u00f6\u00dfe eher die 127mm-Gesch\u00fctze ersetzt.

In 2023, it employed over 13,000 people and reported a total revenue of $9.903 billion.\nAs Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (Regulation SCI) requires, firms must immediately notify the SEC about security incident intrusions and provide an update within 24 hours unless they determine the impact on their operations or market participants is negligible.\n\"The respondents subject to Reg SCI failed to notify the SEC of the intrusion at issue as required. Rather, it was Commission staff that contacted the respondents in the process of assessing reports of similar cyber vulnerabilities,\" the SEC said.\n\"As alleged in the order, they instead took four days to assess its impact and internally conclude it was a de minimis event. When it comes to cybersecurity, especially events at critical market intermediaries, every second counts and four days can be an eternity.\"\nICE discovered the incident on April 15, 2021, after a third party informed it of a potential system intrusion linked to an unknown vulnerability in its virtual private network (VPN).\nBreached by suspected state hackers\nA subsequent investigation revealed that a threat actor deployed a malicious payload on a compromised VPN device used for remote access to its corporate network.\n\"Sophisticated threat actors, believed to be nation-state actors, installed a webshell code onto a compromised VPN device in an attempt to harvest information passing through that device, including employee name, password, and multi-factor authentication codes. This data could allow the threat actor to access internal corporate networks,\" the SEC's order reveals\nHowever, ICE's security team was able to determine that the attacker's access was limited to a single compromised VPN device, even though it found evidence that the threat actor was able to exfiltrate \"VPN configuration data and certain ICE user meta-data.\"\nThe SEC says that ICE staff did not notify the legal and compliance officials at the company's subsidiaries about this VPN security breach for several days, violating both Reg SCI rules and ICE's own internal cyber incident reporting procedures. As a result of this failure, ICE subsidiaries failed to assess the intrusion properly and did not meet their Reg SCI disclosure obligations.\nICE and its subsidiaries consented to the SEC's order, acknowledging that the subsidiaries violated the notification provisions of Regulation SCI and that ICE caused these violations.\nWithout admitting or denying the SEC's findings, ICE and its subsidiaries also agreed to a cease-and-desist order requiring them to stop violating Reg SCI rules and to pay a $10 million civil money penalty.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

We are also excited about the Scheduler feature to help clients request engagements on a self-service basis from us and trigger our project workflow to support them for their continuous PENTesting as a service needs,\u201d added Ayers.\nPlex AI applies PlexTrac\u2019s algorithms to scale findings development and authoring, saving countless hours in manual proactive security report development while ensuring the quality and data integrity that leading MSSPs, MSPs, and enterprises demand. Offensive security teams can provide simple inputs such as CVE or the title of a finding in PlexTrac\u2019s content library and Plex AI will auto-generate the finding\u2019s description and recommended remediation steps.\nThese innovative capabilities help customers in all segments improve security posture and specifically enable service providers to extend their managed service offerings to provide new high-margin recurring revenue streams.\nHosted in Google Cloud and built using Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI platform, Plex AI is designed to deliver a wide range of proactive security reports and analyze large data sets for key themes to include in report narratives to provide vital context on security posture. Critically, pentest and vulnerability assessment teams can aggregate scan, pentest, and offensive engagement data and apply AI to summarize the key themes from a range of proactive security data.\nIn addition to cycle time reduction gained from virtual authoring, Plex AI ensures that offensive security reports are thorough, accurate, and actionable for all key stakeholders. Plex AI was built with security and privacy in mind using private models, enforcing strict RBAC controls, and secure architecture from the beginning. For more information on Plex AI\u2019s security please consult the following FAQ.\nPlexTrac\u2019s new real-time collaboration feature makes offensive security reporting a team sport by allowing security practitioners to have complete visibility into what everyone is doing inside a report. For example, multiple people can edit documents simultaneously without collisions. This is particularly useful for quality assurance use cases and editing findings and narratives auto-created by Plex AI.\nThe scheduler helps facilitate project communication across a team, an MSSP and a client, or between an internal enterprise pentesting team and its stakeholders. The scheduler simplifies the requesting of new engagements from clients or internal stakeholders by receiving inbound scheduling requests, which eliminates manual workflow friction, reduces context switching, and encourages requests to flow in.\nFrom there, offensive security teams can easily schedule new engagements based on resource availability, eliminating some of the time and cost associated with testing. Testing and validation team members can immediately begin work on a set of tasks by accessing a common set of report requirements \u2014 including scope and file attachments \u2014 in one space.\n\u201cWe received a great reaction in the market to the early availability of Plex AI, and we are excited to release the real-time collaboration and scheduler capabilities that amplify the efficiency gains offensive security teams realize from Plex AI,\u201d said Dan DeCloss, CTO, PlexTrac. \u201cWe believe these innovations will help MSSP and enterprise customers become more efficient and effective in their offensive security practices and programs respectively\u201d\nPlex AI is available immediately.

Serien wie \"Tage, die es nicht gab\" und \"Der Schwarm\", Kultiges wie \"Echt fett\" und \"Phettbergs Nette Leit Show\" oder auch \"Trautmann\" und die \"L\u00f6winger B\u00fchne\" stehen neu bereit.\nLieare Ausstrahlung\nF\u00fcr Stirnrunzeln hat gesorgt, dass der ORF, um Serien wie \"Vorstadtweiber\" und \"Kafka\" durchg\u00e4ngig abrufbar halten zu k\u00f6nnen, diese jedes halbe Jahr erneut linear ausstrahlen muss. \"Es ist geplant, m\u00f6glichst viele unserer Premium-Produkte immer abrufbar zu halten. Aber es kann schon mal Monate geben, wo etwas nicht zur Verf\u00fcgung steht\", erkl\u00e4rte Reiter-Kluger. Denn man m\u00fcsse mit Blick auf das \"starke und wichtige\" lineare ORF-Programm \"mit sehr viel Feingef\u00fchl vorgehen\". Man sei in enger Abstimmung mit Programmdirektorin Stefanie Groiss-Horowitz und den Channelmanagern.\nNeu ist, dass das lineare ORF-TV-Programm nahezu vollst\u00e4ndig live gestreamt werden kann. Eine \"24-Stunden-Timeshift-Funktion\" erm\u00f6glicht zeitversetztes Streamen und den Neustart von bereits begonnenen Sendungen.\nDie neue auf maximal 24 Stunden im Voraus begrenzte Online-First-M\u00f6glichkeit sieht die ORF ON-Chefin mit einem lachenden und einem weinenden Auge.\"Unsere Kollegen in Deutschland d\u00fcrfen da wesentlich mehr. Aber wir freuen uns auch so dar\u00fcber und holen das Maximum heraus.\" Geplant sei u.a. eine eigene Online-First-Lane. Derzeit wird etwa \"Willkommen \u00d6sterreich\" rund zwei Stunden vor der linearen Ausstrahlung auf ORF ON angeboten.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Auf welchem Streamingdienst l\u00e4uft was? So findet ihr es heraus\nOnline-Only\nAuf Online-Only-Produktionen hei\u00dft es noch warten. Daf\u00fcr ist eine Auftragsvorpr\u00fcfung durch die Medienbeh\u00f6rde KommAustria n\u00f6tig. Geplant wurde aber bereits: \"Wir haben die Bereiche Breaking News, Kulturveranstaltungen und Veranstaltungen mit einem regionalen Aspekt im Fokus\", so die ORF ON-Chefin.\nMit Blick auf die Barrierefreiheit hielt Reiter-Kluger fest, dass \"immer was zu tun\" sei, sich der ORF aber nicht zu verstecken brauche. Untertitel, eine akustische Bildbeschreibung und \u00d6sterreichische Geb\u00e4rdensprache lassen sich bei diversen Sendungen hinzuf\u00fcgen. Die Video-Abspielgeschwindigkeit kann angepasst werden.\nWer sich kostenlos und freiwillig auf ORF ON registriert und einloggt, kann nicht jugendgerechte Sendungen wie den \"Tatort\" tags\u00fcber ansehen. Auch ist es so m\u00f6glich, Favoriten zu speichern. Reiter-Kluger k\u00fcndigte zudem f\u00fcr die Zukunft ein Feature f\u00fcr ger\u00e4te\u00fcbergreifendes Weiterschauen von Videos an.\nZur\u00fcckhaltend bei Werbung\nMit Werbung zur neuen Plattform hielt sich der ORF noch zur\u00fcck. \"Die TVthek hat eine wahnsinnig hohe Bekanntheit. Ich wei\u00df, dass ORF ON noch keinen hohen Bekanntheitsgrad hat - und das auch nicht haben kann. Es war bisher nur in einer Testversion verf\u00fcgbar\", sagte Reiter-Kluger. Aber f\u00fcr den Umstieg wurde vorgesorgt: Die ca. eine Million heruntergeladenen TVthek-Apps werden automatisch zur ORF-ON-App umgewandelt, sofern automatische Updates auf den Endger\u00e4ten aktiviert sind. Steuert man die Webseite tvthek.ORF.at an, wird man zur neuen Plattform on.ORF.at weitergeleitet. Im Herbst soll eine gro\u00dfe Kampagne die Bekanntheit weiter erh\u00f6hen.\nGemessen wird ORF ON an gro\u00dfen Streaminganbietern wie Netflix und Amazon Prime Video. \"Das ist nat\u00fcrlich schwierig, weil sie ganz andere Ressourcen zur Verf\u00fcgung haben\", gestand Reiter-Kluger. ORF ON w\u00fcrden aber die qualitativ hochwertigen \u00f6ffentlich-rechtlichen Inhalten und die \u00f6sterreichische Identit\u00e4t auszeichnen.\nORF-Inhalte sind auch auf der Streamingplattform Joyn der Privatsendergruppe ProSiebenSat.1Puls4 abrufbar. \"Nat\u00fcrlich w\u00fcnschen wir uns, dass die Userinnen und User unsere Plattform annehmen. Gleichzeitig ist es so, dass \u00d6sterreich ein kleiner Markt ist und es einen Schulterschluss gegen gro\u00dfe Mitbewerber braucht. Die derzeitige Strategie ist daher, mit unseren \u00f6ffentlich-rechtlichen Inhalten auch auf Drittplattformen vertreten zu sein\", sah Reiter-Kluger keinen R\u00fcckzug von Joyn bevorstehen.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: So kann Streaming nachhaltiger werden\nPrivate als Livestream?\nIm Gegenzug ist der ORF gesetzlich verpflichtet, Livestreams von privaten Vollprogrammen auf ORF ON einzubinden - sofern der Wunsch vonseiten der Privatsender danach besteht. \"Bisher gibt es im Videobereich diesbez\u00fcglich noch keine Anfragen\", so die ORF-Managerin.\nDer 22. Mai solle f\u00fcr ORF ON ein Startpunkt sein. \"Es wird viele Updates und Weiterentwicklungen geben\", versprach Reiter-Kluger. Klar sei, dass es aber davor \"da und dort noch holpern\" werde. Man habe f\u00fcr das Gesamtprojekt weniger als ein Jahr Umsetzungszeit gehabt. \"Das Team, das im Hintergrund steht, hat versucht, das Unm\u00f6gliche m\u00f6glich zu machen. Klingt pathetisch, aber meine absolute Hochachtung daf\u00fcr, was gelungen ist\", sagte die ORF ON-Chefin. Bei der Entwicklung floss auch das Feedback von Userinnen und Usern ein.

However, the stolen data included encrypted master passwords, which LastPass warned could be decrypted if they were weak.\nThe stolen data also included unencrypted URLs associated with password entries, providing valuable insight into which password vaults could be targeted to steal credentials to financial services, like cryptocurrency exchanges.\nIt was later revealed that threat actors decrypted some of these weaker master passwords and used the stored credentials to breach cryptocurrency exchanges and steal over $4 million in funds.\nRolling out encryption\nLastPass says that the encryption of URLs requires them to refactor client and back-end component functionality, a work that is already progressing well.\nThe first phase of the URL encryption implementation will occur next month (June 2024), automatically encrypting primary URL fields for all existing and new accounts.\nDuring that stage, duplicate and legacy URL fields in the vault will be deleted, while personal and business accounts will receive emails informing them about the changes.\nThe second phase will occur sometime in the second half of the year when the remaining six URL-related fields stored in LastPass vaults will also be automatically encrypted.\nThese six values concern the equivalent domain URLs, wildcard URLs, redirect URLs, user-defined custom URLs, URLs stored in user notes, and historical URLs.\nCurrently, users don't need to take any action, but LastPass will email impacted accounts step-by-step instructions on how they can take advantage when the roll-out starts next month.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

Officials from the US government have privately expressed concerns to both their Dutch and Taiwanese counterparts about what happens if Chinese aggression escalates into an attack on the island responsible for producing the vast majority of the world's advanced semiconductors, two of the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ASML reassured officials about its ability to remotely disable the machines when the Dutch government met with the company on the threat, two others said. The Netherlands has run simulations on a possible invasion in order to better assess the risks, they added.\nThe remote shut-off applies to Netherlands-based ASML's line of extreme ultraviolet machines, known within the industry as EUVs, for which TSMC is its single biggest client. EUVs harness high-frequency light waves to print the smallest microchip transistors in existence -- creating chips that have artificial-intelligence uses as well as more sensitive military applications. About the size of a city bus, an EUV requires regular servicing and updates. As part of that, the company can remotely force a shut-off which would act as a kill switch, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Veldhoven-based company is the world's only manufacturer of these machines, which sell for more than $217 million apiece.\nThe remote shut-off applies to Netherlands-based ASML's line of extreme ultraviolet machines, known within the industry as EUVs, for which TSMC is its single biggest client.

I've been to Taiwan, I've had a week's worth of starbucks coffees from one of the Fab 12 building's 7'th floor kiosk in Hsinchu city. Let me tell you about the culture there.\nMore than 2 decades ago, we came in with what at the time was cutting edge Big Data analysis software we'd created. Now a days it'd be called machine learning or AI, but back then, it was Big Data. It could track down issues and correlate cause and effects with semiconductor data. Hey, you've got a common short on layer 12 because of copper growth issues with your scrubber pass on layer 6. Or in one case, when operator #3401 is logged into the transport machine, yield goes down by 12% and the number of scratches, closed vias, and particulate defects increases by 6%. Good stuff.\nAnyway, we bring our software in, do a demo - which takes about a week - and our point of contact could not care less. He tells everyone that we're unnecessary, not needed, he can do what our expensive SaaS does, himself. So we have a little challenge, blow him out of the water, and that's after he stripped OUR data of identifiers, so we can't tell if the data is a voltage test or resistance or defect identifier or whatever. Anyway, he stays in the meeting to discuss things after the presentation of results, and comes out later grinning.\nWe go to pack up and he's got 4 guys with him - \"You can't take your laptop out of the building,\" he says. It's had their data on it, even anonymized, and they believe it's a security risk. We might be spies. They caught some last week.\nNow while we were there, we had to run all the analysis from the laptop, which remained on site, locked to a table. One night, we found our analysis was interrupted and the hard drive had been removed while the system was still running. They had made a copy. Tried to steal our software.\nBut we knew this was going to happen. This is how things work in Asia, and our code was CPU locked, so it wouldn't work without a lot of extra work. So by the time we were ready to leave, they realized they needed the laptop itself to run it. Or maybe it was just easier in any case. So we said we had to wipe it to protect our IP, which they had no problems with. So we got out our tools, and took the motherboard and hard drive out and ...\n\"What are you doing?!?!\" - one of the folks left to watch us cried. \"Oh, we're destroying it so it can't be used.\" \"YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT!\" he shouted, as another one sprinted out of the room to get the manager. I'm drilling through the cpu when he gets there, his face bright red, \"This isn't necessary\" he says. \"It's okay, we don't mind,\" we respond. \"We want to make sure no one can use our software.\"\nHe kept trying to get us to stop, saying how unnecessary it was, and I'm pretty sure as I was snapping the hard drive disks with pliers that he was crying - either from fear or rage, I don't know - but that was that. We declined their literal spyware-laden \"replacement laptops,\" and noted how the two non-special-software laptops which had been used to create the presentation and had also had data on them - were not included in the 'keep' order. ...\nThe purpose behind this story is to note that the overwhelming mindset in that area of the world is deep, fundamental and systemic lack of morals.

What actions you can take depend on the content and the chat provider capabilities in Copilot in Windows. For example, you may highlight a block of text and decide to summarise it, translate it, or open it with a text editor like Word or Notepad. If you highlight an image, you will be able to edit it or use your chat provider in Copilot in Windows to find or create a similar image,\u201d Microsoft explains.\n\u201cRecall will also enable you to open the snapshot in the original application in which it was created, and, as Recall is refined over time, it will open the actual source document, website or email in a screenshot.\u201d\nWindows 11 Recall settings\nThese are the most salient details related to this new feature (as outlined by Microsoft):\nThe screenshots are stored only on the device, and are protected \u201cusing data encryption on your device and (if you have Windows 11 Pro or an enterprise Windows 11 SKU) BitLocker\u201d\n-\nThe screenshots are not sent to or used by Microsoft for ad targeting\n-\n\u201cScreenshots are only available to the person whose profile was used to sign in to the device. If two people share a device with different profiles they will not be able to access each other\u2019s screenshots. If they use the same profile to sign in to the device then they will share a screenshot history.\u201d\n-\nUsers can prevent Recall from collecting content from specific apps or websites visited in a supported browser. Recall does not take snapshots of InPrivate web browsing sessions in Microsoft Edge, DRM-protected content, but \u201cwill not hide information such as passwords or financial account numbers, (\u2026) especially when sites do not follow standard internet protocols like cloaking password entry.\u201d\n-\nUsers can pause the creation of snapshots, delete them, and switch Recall off\n-\nThe possible security and privacy pitfalls of Windows Recall\nSecurity and privacy professionals, who are used to viewing technological solutions and new features through an attacker\u2019s lens, have immediately pinpointed its possible disadvantages.\nKevin Beaumont thinks the feature will be a boon for criminals using information-stealing malware. \u201cThe whole thing is a truly terrible idea that will allow AI to super power fraudsters \u2013 just steal the Recall database, instead of just the local browser password database,\u201d he noted.\nEven if the database can\u2019t be exfiltrated, there are info-stealers out there that use optical character recognition (OCR) to extract sensitive text from images/screenshots.\nBeaumont also pointed out that while Recall can be switched off, it can also be covertly turned on by threat actors with Powershell.\n\u201cMicrosoft are inventing a new security nightmare using Copilot, which will undoubtedly lead to increased fraud for consumers and other woes for businesses,\u201d he opined.\nBut there are also other potential security, safety and privacy issues that may arise.\nFor one: How much do you trust your partner / family / roomate / coworkers (or even your government)? If they manage to get your computer password, they can easily search through your snapshots for other passwords, sensitive data, etc.\nEnterprises should also consider that the feature may \u201crecall\u201d confidential business data.\nAnd then: How much do you trust Microsoft? The company is not using Recall snapshots now, but that can easily change in the future. They might want to use the feature to train AI, for example.\nEarlier this month, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sent a memo to employees asking them to prioritize security above all else, even releasing new features.\nI guess time will tell whether it was just an effort to score some good publicity in the wake of the breaches the company suffered by the hands of suspected state-sponsored hackers in past years, and the scathing report on the company\u2019s defenses by the CISA\u2019s Cyber Safety Review Board.", "hash": "a8dc69e442de2ca2d8b86e34b22d880ae684d1c10d8e06804a3707d06a89b8fe", "id": "9484756e-57e6-4b81-837c-42117ff36758", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/05/22/windows-recall-security-privacy/", "osint_source_id": "c5bebd4b-5715-4589-a65c-0344a226ab6f", "published": "2024-05-22T12:21:49", "source": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/feed", "story_id": "ccf6690a-a92c-4dde-954c-fabbe7c0fa62", "title": "Windows\u2019 new Recall feature: A privacy and security nightmare?"}], "tags": {"Beaumont": {"name": "Beaumont", "tag_type": "PER"}, "BitLocker": {"name": "BitLocker", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "CISA": {"name": "CISA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Copilot": {"name": "Copilot", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "DRM-protected": {"name": "DRM-protected", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "InPrivate": {"name": "InPrivate", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Kevin Beaumont": {"name": "Kevin Beaumont", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Microsoft Edge": {"name": "Microsoft Edge", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "PowerShell": {"name": "PowerShell", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Satya Nadella": {"name": "Satya Nadella", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Windows": {"name": "Windows", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Windows 11": {"name": "Windows 11", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Windows 11 Pro": {"name": "Windows 11 Pro", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Windows 11 SKU": {"name": "Windows 11 SKU", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Windows\u2019 new Recall feature: A privacy and security nightmare?"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-22T17:19:57.439910", "id": "f7068c7e-61e6-4079-a42f-0a32d4c95f2b", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "4"}], "created": "2024-05-22T12:21:14", "id": "20b723e2-a748-474a-9243-b308908f0f74", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Neuralink-Implantat hat sich zu 85 Prozent vom Gehirn des Patienten gel\u00f6st\nDas Implantat von Neuralink soll es erm\u00f6glichen, durch Gedanken ein Smartphone zu bedienen und auch andere Technik.

The data will be saved in a semantic index, allowing Windows users to browse through the snapshot history or search using human language queries.\nMicrosoft says that all of this data is encrypted using BitLocker tied to the user's Windows account and is not shared with other users on the same device.\nWhile this sounds fun and interesting, it immediately raised concerns about obvious privacy risks and whether Microsoft plans on gobbling up all of this data.\nHowever, Microsoft says Recall has been designed so that all of the data is saved directly on the user's device in an encrypted format, providing users with complete control over the feature, including if it's enabled and what apps it can take screenshots of.\n\"Recall is a key part of what makes Copilot+ PCs special, and Microsoft built privacy into Recall's design from the ground up. On Copilot+ PCs powered by a Snapdragon\u00ae X Series processor, you will see the Recall taskbar icon after you first activate your device. You can use that icon to open Recall's settings and make choices about what snapshots Recall collects and stores on your device. You can limit which snapshots Recall collects; for example, you can select specific apps or websites visited in a supported browser to filter out of your snapshots. In addition, you can pause snapshots on demand from the Recall icon in the system tray, clear some or all snapshots that have been stored, or delete all the snapshots from your device.\"\n\u2756 MicrosoftMicrosoft also says it will not create screenshots of Microsoft Edge's InPrivate windows (and other Chromium-based browsers) or content protected by DRM. However, they have not confirmed whether other browser's private modes, like Firefox, will be supported.\nIn a Monday press event, Yusuf Mehdi, Corporate Vice President & Consumer Chief Marketing Officer, assured journalists that Microsoft is taking a very conservative approach with Recall.\n\"We're going to keep your Recall index private and local and secure on just the device,\" said Mehdi.\n\"We won't use any of that information to train any AI model, and we put you completely in control with the ability to edit and delete anything that is captured.\"\nFurthermore, Microsoft also reiterated to BleepingComputer that data for Recall will only be available locally and not be stored in the cloud, with the company once again restating that \"data is not accessed by Microsoft.\"\nMicrosoft has also started to share more technical details, such as group policies that can be used to disable Recall company-wide and how end users can disable the feature.\nCybersecurity experts and regular users still concerned\nMicrosoft's promises have not done much to reassure the cybersecurity community or its customers, with our tweet regarding this new feature receiving over 90 comments, all negative.\nSo, why are most cybersecurity experts, researchers, and analysts so worried about this feature?\nFirst and foremost, large companies have a history of exploiting users' data for their own profit, making it hard for users to trust Microsoft when they say they won't access the Recall data.\nUsers are not alone, as the United Kingdom's data protection agency, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), is also contacting Microsoft to ensure that users' data will be properly safeguarded and not used by the company.\n\"We expect organisations to be transparent with users about how their data is being used and only process personal data to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a specific purpose. Industry must consider data protection from the outset and rigorously assess and mitigate risks to peoples' rights and freedoms before bringing products to market,\" reads a press statement from the ICO.\n\"We are making enquiries with Microsoft to understand the safeguards in place to protect user privacy.\"\nEven if we accept that Microsoft will not access Recall data, there are still massive security and privacy implications with this product.\nMicrosoft admits that the feature performs no content moderation, meaning it will gobble up anything it sees, including passwords in a password manager or your account numbers on your banking website.\nOr if you are in Word, writing a confidential agreement, a screenshot of that content will be created, too. If you have a single PC and share it with others, then you may want to be careful about what pictures or videos you look at, as, guess what, those will be recorded as well.\nYes, you can block apps from being screenshotted by this feature, but most people will just let it run without mucking around with the feature's settings.\nAll of this information is now stored in Windows 11's semantic index and easily searchable by anyone with access to your PC, whether authorized or not.\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg, though.\nIf a threat actor or malware compromised your device, all of this data will already be decrypted by Bitlocker, making it accessible to the hacker.\nFor example, a threat actor or malware could simply steal a Recall database and upload it to their own servers for analysis. This information could then be used to extort users or potentially breach user's accounts if credentials were exposed.\nCybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont, known to be an outspoken critic of Microsoft at times, also expressed concern about how this feature creates a massive attack surface, likening it to a keylogger \"baked into Windows.\"\n\"If you look at what has happened historically with infostealer malware \u2014 malicious software snuck onto PCs \u2014 it has pivoted to automatically steal browser passwords stored locally,\" Beaumont explained in a new blog post.\n\"In other words, if a malicious threat actor gains access to a system, they already steal important databases stored locally. They can just extend this to steal information recorded by Copilot's Recall feature.\"\nAnd it's not only information-stealing malware, as enterprise-targeting malware like TrickBot had previously included modules that would steal a domain's Active Directory database for offline cracking of credentials.

NIST made a preliminary announcement of the algorithms in 2022.\nConrad Prince, a former official at GCHQ and now a distinguished fellow at RUSI, told Neuberger that during his previous career there had consistently been a concern about hostile states having the capability to decrypt the plaintext of secure messages, although this capability was consistently estimated at being roughly a decade away and had been for the last 20 years.\nNeuberger said the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s estimate is similar, \u201cthe early 2030s,\u201d for when a CRQC would be operational. But the time-frame is relevant, said the White House advisor, because \u201cthere is national security data that is collected today and even if decrypted eight years from now, can still be damaging.\u201d\nBritain\u2019s NCSC has warned that contemporary threat actors could be collecting and storing intelligence data today for decryption \u201cat some point in the future.\u201d\n\u201cGiven the cost of storing vast amounts of old data for decades, such an attack is only likely to be worthwhile for very high-value information,\u201d stated the NCSC. As such, the possibility of a CRQC existing at some point in the next decade is a very relevant threat right now.\nNeuberger added: \u201cCertainly there\u2019s some data that\u2019s time sensitive, you know, a ship that looks to be transporting weapons to a sanctioned country, probably in eight years we don\u2019t care about that anymore.\u201d\nPublishing the new NIST algorithms is a protection against adversaries collecting the most sensitive kinds of data today, Neuberger added.\nA spokesperson for NIST told Recorded Future News: \u201cThe plan is to release the algorithms this summer. We don\u2019t have anything more specific to offer at this time.\u201d\nBut publishing the algorithms is not the last step in moving to a quantum-resistant computing world. The NCSC has warned it is actually just the second step in what will be \u201ca very complicated undertaking.\u201d\nEven if any one of the algorithms proposed by NIST achieves universal acceptance as something that is unbreakable by a quantum computer, it would not be a simple matter of just swapping those algorithms in for the old-fashioned ones.\nPart of the challenge is that most systems that currently depend on public-key cryptography for their security are not necessarily capable of running the resource-heavy software used in post-quantum cryptography.\nUltimately, the security of public key cryptographic systems relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring very large prime numbers \u2014 something that traditional computers find exhaustingly difficult.\nHowever, research by American mathematician Peter Shor, published in 1994, proposed an algorithm that could be run on a quantum computer for finding these prime factors with far more ease; potentially undermining some of the key assumptions about what makes public-key cryptography secure.\nThe good news, according to NCSC, is that while advances in quantum computing are continuing to be made, the machines that exist today \u201care still limited, and suffer from relatively high error rates in each operation they perform,\u201d stated the agency.\nBut the NCSC warned that \u201cin the future, it is possible that error rates can be lowered such that a large, general-purpose quantum computer could exist,\u201d but it is \u201cimpossible to predict when this may happen.\u201d\nAlexander Martin\nis the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

KEDA extends the functionality of the native Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with a wide variety of scalers and scale-to-zero capabilities, thus allowing user applications to meet demand in a more sustainable and cost-efficient manner.\n \nToday, we are excited to announce that the Azure Portal now supports KEDA scaling on memory, CPU, cron and Azure Service Bus scalers. Users will be able to easily create scaled objects and monitor their scaled objects and jobs all within the Portal interface, and for Azure Service Bus, Portal will handle the deployment and configuration of workload identity. This will streamline the creation and management of KEDA resources through the Portal interface.\n \nWhat is KEDA and why use it?\n \nKEDA is a Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaler that can scale applications in Kubernetes based on metrics from external scalers. KEDA also supports scaling workloads to zero when there are no events to process and scaling them back up when events occur. This way, users can optimize their resource utilization and reduce their costs.\n \nKEDA works by creating custom resources in Kubernetes that define the scaling logic and the external scaler to use. KEDA then creates an HPA for each ScaledObject and monitors the metrics from the external scaler to adjust the number of pods accordingly. KEDA also supports scaling on metrics from the Kubernetes metrics server, such as memory and CPU usage.\n \nHow to use KEDA in the Azure Portal\n \nAzure Portal, a web-based interface that allows users to manage their Azure resources and services, now supports creating KEDA ScaledObjects and monitoring ScaledObjects and ScaledJobs in just a few clicks. Users can also view the status and current metrics of their KEDA resources, as well as all KEDA events and warnings.\n \nTo scale with KEDA through the Azure Portal, users need to have a Kubernetes cluster with the AKS KEDA add-on enabled, as well as an Azure subscription. Users can then follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to the Workloads tab, select a workload, and select \u201cScale\u201d from the top menu, or select the \u201cApplication scaling\u201d tab from the left menu.\nEnable the AKS KEDA add-on if not already enabled.\n\n \n\n \n \n\nClick on the \u201cCreate\u201d button to create a new ScaledObject.\nFill in the required fields, such as the name, namespace, workload type, workload name, and trigger details. Please note that the autoscaling of Kubernetes system deployments is not recommended and thus disabled through the Portal experience.\n\n \n\n \n\nClick on the \u201cCreate\u201d button to deploy the KEDA resource.\nFor the Azure Service Bus scaler, Portal will automatically create and assign a managed identity to the workload and grant it the necessary permissions to access the Service Bus namespace and queue or topic.\nGo back to the \u201cApplication scaling\u201d tab and select the resource to view its details, such as the current and desired metric and current replicas.\n\n \n\n \nConclusion\n \nKEDA in the Azure Portal makes it easy and convenient for users to create and monitor KEDA resources that scale container workloads on events in Kubernetes.  Users can now enjoy the benefits of KEDA and Azure Portal to run their event-driven applications in a scalable and cost-effective way.\n\u00a0", "hash": "add7396200b418255d8f54abefb4b6d46e33a5997155ba0607e6e1a7b23ccbe5", "id": "f186c719-fa80-4e46-8f20-dc5f4edcfae3", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/general-availability-of-kubernetes-event-driven-autoscaler-keda/ba-p/4149281", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-22T11:46:00", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "c0d392c6-c16d-4b2b-93ee-91959da0eb3a", "title": "General Availability of Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaler (KEDA) in Azure Portal"}], "tags": {"HPA": {"name": "HPA", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "KEDA": {"name": "KEDA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Kubernetes": {"name": "Kubernetes", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaler": {"name": "Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaler", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Kubernetes-based": {"name": "Kubernetes-based", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Portal": {"name": "Portal", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Scale": {"name": "Scale", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ScaledJobs": {"name": "ScaledJobs", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ScaledObject": {"name": "ScaledObject", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ScaledObjects": {"name": "ScaledObjects", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "General Availability of Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaler (KEDA) in Azure Portal"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-22T17:08:51.979903", "id": "4e5835e7-c34b-43b8-8931-dbcd3c777e70", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "5"}, {"created": "2024-05-22T17:11:45.119531", "id": "c4eba81d-6561-4365-a4c9-c1a7b7611fec", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "5"}], "created": "2024-05-22T11:16:25", "id": "b8c94081-6477-43d9-8bca-4cacee0e1130", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Fragen?

Gr\u00f6\u00dfe\nGro\u00dfe TV-Ger\u00e4te mit 55 Zoll und mehr liegen im Trend. Wie sinnvoll ein Riesen-Fernseher ist, h\u00e4ngt auch davon ab, wie weit man davon weg sitzt. Au\u00dferdem gilt es zu bedenken, wie hochaufl\u00f6send die Inhalte sind, die man schaut. Bei sch\u00e4rferem 4K-Content kann man n\u00e4her dran sitzen, als bei der FullHD-Aufl\u00f6sung.\nTV-Hersteller Panasonic bietet auf seiner Webseite etwa einen Ratgeber an, wie viel Abstand zwischen Bildschirm und Betrachter*in sein sollte. Bei einem HD-Signal wird die 2,5-fache Bildschirmdiagonale empfohlen. Bei einem 4K-Signal reicht die 1,5-fache Entfernung.\nGeht man davon aus, dass man meistens FullHD-Inhalte schaut, sollten es bei einem 55-Zoll-Ger\u00e4t also 3,5 Meter sein. Bei 65 Zoll bereits 4,10 Meter. Bei 4K-Content kann man bei den gleichen Diagonalen 2,10 bzw. 2,50 Meter an den Fernseher heranr\u00fccken.\n3. Bildtechnologie\nF\u00fcr TV- und Heimkino-Enthusiasten ist die Panel-Technologie eine oftmals emotional diskutierte Frage. War es fr\u00fcher meistens Plasma vs LCD, sind heute mehrere Player im Spiel. Dazu geh\u00f6ren LCD mit verschiedenen Hintergrundbeleuchtungstechnologien, QLED und OLED. Plasma ist heute vom Markt mehr oder weniger verschwunden.\nBei einem Gro\u00dfteil der angebotenen Fernseher handelt es sich um Liquid-Crystal Displays - LCD. Das sind die g\u00fcnstigsten Bildschirme und sie sind meistens noch mit dem Zusatz LED versehen. Dabei handelt es sich um Dioden, die zur Hintergrundbeleuchtung eingesetzt werden. Je mehr solche einzeln ansteuerbaren Dioden vorhanden sind, desto kontrastreicher und besser ist das Fernsehbild. Bei g\u00fcnstigeren Modellen sind die Dioden meist nur am Rand des Bildes, man spricht von \u201cEdge-lit\u201d. Besser wird das Bild, wenn auf der gesamten Fl\u00e4che LEDs zum Einsatz kommen, hier spricht man von Full-array LEDs.\nZus\u00e4tzlich gibt es noch QLED bzw. TV-Ger\u00e4te mit Quantum-Dot-Technologie. Dabei handelt es sich um LED-LCD-Fernseher, die \u00fcber eine Nanokristallschicht verf\u00fcgen. Die Kristalle leuchten in Farben, wenn das LED-Licht der Hintergrundbeleuchtung auf sie trifft. Das f\u00fchrt zu einer kr\u00e4ftigeren Darstellung, die sich von gew\u00f6hnlichen LC-Fernsehern abhebt.\nGanz ohne Hintergrundbeleuchtung kommen OLED-Fernseher aus, da jedes Pixel selbstst\u00e4ndig leuchtet. Die Displaytechnologie kennt man auch von Smartphones. Sie sorgt f\u00fcr besonders intensive Farben, starke Kontraste und ist dar\u00fcber hinaus energiesparend. Nachteil ist, dass die Ger\u00e4te deutlich teurer sind als LCD-Fernseher. Auch besteht bei den Displays die Gefahr, dass sich Bilder \u201ceinbrennen\u201d und die Qualit\u00e4t im Laufe der Jahre nachl\u00e4sst.\nDas sch\u00f6nste Bild bekommt man aktuell mit QLED- oder OLED-Fernseher. Wenn man sparsamer unterwegs sein m\u00f6chte, greift man zum LCD-Fernseher mit LED-Beleuchtung, vorzugsweise nicht nur an den R\u00e4ndern.\nAls Technologie der Zukunft gilt microLED. Diese Ger\u00e4te sind derzeit aber noch extrem teuer und kaum verbreitet. Die Ger\u00e4te kosten sogar so viel, dass Samsung einen 10.000-Euro-Fernseher zu einem MicroLED-TV verschenkt. MicroLED sind mikroskopisch kleine Leuchtioden (LED), deren Helligkeit beeinflusst werden kann. Der Unterschied zu OLED besteht im Material: Das \u201eO\u201c steht f\u00fcr \u201eorganisch\u201c, w\u00e4hrend MicroLEDs synthetisch hergestellt werden. Der nat\u00fcrliche Zerfallsprozess sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass OLED-Fernseher nur eine begrenzte Lebensdauer haben - bei den synthetischen microLEDs soll das nicht passieren.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Samsung verschenkt 10.000-Euro-Fernseher zu MicroLED-TV\n4. HDR\nWer ein besonders kontrastreiches und farbstarkes Bild haben m\u00f6chte, sollte darauf achten, dass das Ger\u00e4t HDR-f\u00e4hig ist. Der industrieweite Standard ist hier HDR10. Die Sound-Firma Dolby hat au\u00dferdem den propriet\u00e4ren Standard Dolby Vision eingef\u00fchrt, den Fernsehhersteller lizenzieren k\u00f6nnen und der - neben HDR10 - auch von Streaming-Diensten wie Netflix und Amazon Prime unterst\u00fctzt wird.\nUm die Sache komplizierter zu machen, hat Samsung mit HDR10+ einen eigenen propriet\u00e4ren HDR-Standard geschaffen, der aber nicht so weit verbreitet ist, wie Dolbys Technologie.\n5. Smart-TV\nWer heute ein TV-Ger\u00e4t kauft, kommt um einen Smart-TV nicht herum. Die Hersteller haben unterschiedliche Plattformen mit Apps wie Netflix, YouTube und Co. Das Thema Smart-TV ist in den vergangenen Jahren auch von Vorf\u00e4llen hinsichtlich Sicherheit gepr\u00e4gt gewesen. Das Problem ist, dass Hersteller die Software stiefm\u00fctterlich behandeln und Sicherheitsl\u00fccken nicht rechtzeitig schlie\u00dfen.\nAlternativ hat man die M\u00f6glichkeit, ganz auf die integrierten Smart-TV-Funktionen des Fernsehers zu verzichten und stattdessen \u00fcber ein externes Ger\u00e4t Inhalte abzuspielen. Beliebte Vertreter solcher Devices sind etwa Googles Chromecast oder Amazons Fire TV Sticks.\n6. Anschl\u00fcsse und Sound\nExterne Ger\u00e4te werden heute fast ausnahmslos \u00fcber HDMI angeschlossen. Vor dem Kauf sollte man sich also \u00fcberlegen, was man alles anschlie\u00dfen m\u00f6chte und ob genug Steckpl\u00e4tze vorhanden sind.\nWer keinen externen AV-Receiver verwendet, der f\u00fcr zus\u00e4tzliche HDMI-Steckpl\u00e4tze sorgt, sollte mindestens 4 Anschl\u00fcsse einplanen. Grunds\u00e4tzlich gilt hier: Je mehr, desto besser. Wer sich ein teures High-End-Modell leistet, sollte darauf achten, dass es mindestens HDMI-Standard 2.1a unterst\u00fctzt oder besser HDMI 2.1b. Entsprechende Kabel gibt es auf Amazon um rund 15 Euro.\nKeine Wunder darf man sich beim Sound aktueller Fernseher erwarten. Ohne externe L\u00f6sung kommt hier in der Regel kein Heimkino-Erlebnis auf. Die einfachste Art und Weise, den Sound im Heimkino zu verbessern, ist eine Soundbar. Ab 150 Euro bekommt man hier durchaus brauchbare Modelle (etwa auf Amazon), die sich sehr einfach installieren lassen. Wer es gerne mit etwas mehr Bass hat, sollte sich einen externen Subwoofer anschaffen oder eine Soundbar, die mit einem Subwoofer geliefert wird.\nWer es gerne noch besser klingen lassen m\u00f6chte, kommt um die Anschaffung eines externen AV-Receivers bzw. eines Surround-Systems nicht herum. Hierf\u00fcr muss der Raum auch so aufgebaut sein, dass sich die Boxen rund um die Zuseher*innen platzieren lassen.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: The Wall: So baut Samsung gewaltige TVs in der Slowakei\nWARUM WIR PARTNERLINKS EINSETZEN\nUnsere Artikel entstehen in redaktioneller Unabh\u00e4ngigkeit.

That is, the fact that it is a string of characters with a given length.\nSo, the prudent way to do it is to first generate a random character string of the same length and then pixelate that string.\nOr just replace it with Lorem ipsum.\nBtw, the same approach might be successful with badly pixelated faces in video.\nDepixelation seem to be a well studied art in Japanese Adult Video.

Static photos may get by with minimum block size. I don\u2019t know about moving images if the intent is to maintain a level of aesthetic integrity with the whole image. Maybe introducing randomness would help.\nCar number plates are often pixelated in the media especially of VIP\u2019s.

Each signal consists of multiple time dispersed copies of it\u2019s self. And gets called \u2018Inter Symbol Interference'(ISI) which if used with care can improve the information capacity of a channel\nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/digital_communication/digital_communication_pulse_shaping.htm\nKnowing that noise is actually multiple sources of information not true randomness, tells you why you can \u2018de-pixelate\u2019 images that are either not random or the randomness can be modelled in some -usually- out of band way thus removed layer by layer.\nIf you think of pixelation as being a very low grade substitution cipher with at best poor chaining, as opposed to a One Time Pad. You can also see why it can be removed layer by layer.\nAs is seen with the \u2018Crypto-Tux\u2019 or \u2018ECB-Penguin\u2019 image where the Linux Tux Penguin gets encrypted using AES-128 in \u2018Electronic Cipher Book\u2019 simple substitution Mode\nhttps://github.com/robertdavidgraham/ecb-penguin\nThe actual moral is\n\u201cFully Determanistic algorithms have inverse algorithms.\u201d\n(Even supposed \u201cOne Way Functions\u201d are invertible to a dictionary attack, especially if the actual input data has a very limited input set).\nSubscribe to comments on this entry\nSidebar photo of Bruce Schneier by Joe MacInnis.\nLeave a comment", "hash": "fbd19cdd0bf69e4cb32eb49bd0c4b1f90b9273731b31419454739709af80087b", "id": "2311c296-b767-4e83-9d4e-27f70f35f48a", "link": "https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/05/unredacting-pixelated-text.html", "osint_source_id": "2d33ace7-1f3c-42ee-8fd2-166005fb7560", "published": "2024-05-22T11:03:26", "source": "https://www.schneier.com/blog/index2.xml", "story_id": "18a56360-7604-4d62-ab1c-cead8b12d7a6", "title": "Unredacting Pixelated Text"}], "tags": {"AES-128": {"name": "AES-128", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "AWGN": {"name": "AWGN", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Bruce Schneier": {"name": "Bruce Schneier", "tag_type": "PER"}, "CCTV": {"name": "CCTV", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "ECB-Penguin\u2019": {"name": "ECB-Penguin\u2019", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Joe MacInnis": {"name": "Joe MacInnis", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Winter": {"name": "Winter", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Unredacting Pixelated Text"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-22T17:17:59.336459", "id": "852c7f3d-ea1f-4eba-8e4a-5fe97fe14d5b", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "6"}], "created": "2024-05-22T11:00:42", "id": "42552762-4b80-4d6e-97af-fae37014c256", "news_items": [{"author": "Bryan Cockfield", "content": "Even though Apple isn\u2019t known for making the most pro-consumer devices ever (at least not since the Apple II), the trope that Apples aren\u2019t upgradable, customizable, or otherwise hackable doesn\u2019t really hold much weight. It does take more work to modify them or change how Apple wants them to behave, but it\u2019s not completely impossible. Take this example of a \u201994 Apple PowerBook which runs macOS Moneterey thanks largely to new internals from a 2015 MacBook Pro.\n[Billy] originally intended for a Raspberry Pi to go inside this old PowerBook, but at the time, prices for ARM single-board computer (SBC) were astronomical. For around the same price as the Pi was at the time, he was able to pick up a retina display from an iPad and the internals from a broken MacBook Pro to outfit this retro case. There\u2019s also a Teensy installed to get the trackpad working and a driver board for the display from Adafruit, and a number of case mods were needed to get everything to fit including the screen which was slightly larger than the original 9.5\u2033 display the laptop would have shipped with.\nThis project took both inspiration and some of the actual code needed to get everything working from another project we featured a while ago where a Mac Mini was installed inside of a PowerBook case from 1993. Unlike projects that use smaller SBCs for retrocomputing, these builds are notable because the hardware on the inside makes them usable as daily driver computers even today, and might even be an upgrade if you\u2019re using the internals from a MacBook Pro that would have originally had a butterfly keyboard.\n5 thoughts on \u201c90s PowerBook Runs MacOS Monterey\u201d\nNice stuff I\u2019d like to see, just out of nostalgia a clamshell retrofit althoigh the massive bezel would not make it a Smart choice for a daily driver.\n\u201cUpgradeable and customizable\u201d does not in good faith cover \u201cripping out the entirety of the electronics from 1993 and dremel-tooling the case to accept mostly unmodified parts from today.\u201d\nMaybe so, but it\u2019s still a worthy effort.\nTrue, but I was using a 2015 mbp as my main machine until last year when I upgraded to Apple silicon; one of my team still has a 2015 \u2013 it\u2019s had a ram and HD upgrade and a new battery, and is entirely serviceable.\nBrilliant!

A Canadian university, a US healthcare business, and a UK software business were all previously claimed in December 2023.\nThe NCC Group however, insists only one duplicated attack was included in the specific dataset that informed its research.\nIts findings show that in April, LockBit only posted 23 organizations (including one duplicate) \u2013 a 60 percent drop compared to its pre-bust numbers (with the duplicated attacks accounted for). Play, Hunters, and Ransomhub took the top three spots respectively.\nGlobal ransomware activity was down 15 percent month-on-month but rose one percent year-on-year \u2013 a finding NCC Group believes is due to both the takedown of LockBit in February and the increasing adoption of AI by cybercriminals.\n\"Despite the successful takedowns of major groups like LockBit, now is not the time to slow down efforts to protect against cyber threats,\" said Matt Hull, global head of threat intelligence at NCC Group.\n\"The continuous rise of new and equally menacing threat actors, alongside constant development of AI and emerging technologies, poses a unique risk to society that we must collaborate globally to mitigate.\"\n\"The year-on-year rise in ransomware attacks is likely linked to the explosion of AI, revolutionizing how threat actors can operate. However, it's not all doom and gloom. We should be adopting AI to fight against these threats. But we need to act quickly so we don't end up playing catch up to these threat actors.\"\nRegional shifts\nNorth America and Europe were unsurprisingly again the two most targeted continents by ransomware. It's very often the case given that most ransomware miscreants reside in countries that are adversaries to the leading economies in the West.\nFirst LockBit, now BreachForums: Are cops winning the war or just a few battles?\n-\nWith ransomware whales becoming so dominant, would-be challengers ask 'what's the point?'\n-\nFirst LockBit, now BreachForums: Are cops winning the war or just a few battles?\n-\nLockBit identity reveal a bigger letdown than Game of Thrones Season 8\n-\nAs such, 80 percent of all ransomware attacks targeted organizations across the two continents, but none more so than North America, which withstood 58 percent of the global total. Europe was targeted the second most with 35 percent of the global total, a seven percent decrease month-on-month.\nThat said, the researchers cited findings from an April report by security firm Performanta which claimed developing nations in Africa and South America may become a \"proving ground\" for experimental new malware. The workshopping of attack scenarios against organizations in Africa is likely to be perceived as having fewer risks attached to it, the report concluded.\nNCC Group said we may therefore see a growing proportion of attacks in developing nations in future. \u00ae", "hash": "6e02383022e85615c97355b9c0c68bd3fc8e9738241664b1a92754412ddbbff5", "id": "4aeb9356-d855-4074-8203-12242891a891", "link": "https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2024/05/22/lockbit_dethroned_as_leading_ransomware/", "osint_source_id": "a94d3f15-5689-470c-9d1f-670b8c63491d", "published": "2024-05-22T11:00:11", "source": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/headlines.atom", "story_id": "e59d7e8a-60ac-45fe-9d0b-dc594d1a2c1b", "title": "LockBit dethroned as leading ransomware gang for first time post-takedown"}], "tags": {"Africa": {"name": "Africa", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Canadian": {"name": "Canadian", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Dmitry Khoroshev": {"name": "Dmitry Khoroshev", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Europe": {"name": "Europe", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "LockBit": {"name": "LockBit", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Matt Hull": {"name": "Matt Hull", "tag_type": "PER"}, "NCA": {"name": "NCA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "NCC Group": {"name": "NCC Group", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "North America": {"name": "North America", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Performanta": {"name": "Performanta", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "South America": {"name": "South America", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "West": {"name": "West", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "LockBit dethroned as leading ransomware gang for first time post-takedown"}, {"attributes": [], "created": "2024-05-22T10:59:02", "id": "f0a9e07e-f296-43e8-96d2-55ec22c6233f", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Besuchen Sie Golem.de wie gewohnt mit Werbung und Tracking, indem Sie der Nutzung aller Cookies zustimmen.

Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what\u2019s happened, and follow any specific advice they offer.\n-\nChange your password. You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a strong password that you don\u2019t use for anything else. Better yet, let a password manager choose one for you.\n-\nEnable two-factor authentication (2FA). If you can, use a FIDO2-compliant hardware key, laptop or phone as your second factor. Some forms of two-factor authentication (2FA) can be phished just as easily as a password. 2FA that relies on a FIDO2 device can\u2019t be phished.\n-\nWatch out for fake vendors. The thieves may contact you posing as the vendor. Check the vendor website to see if they are contacting victims, and verify any contacts using a different communication channel.\n-\nTake your time. Phishing attacks often impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions, and security alerts.\n-\nSet up identity monitoring. Identity monitoring alerts you if your personal information is found being traded illegally online, and helps you recover after.\n-\nCheck your digital footprint\nIf you want to find out how much of your own data has been exposed online, you can try our free Digital Footprint scan.

It provides the full capabilities of GitHub, including source code management, version control, collaboration tools, and continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), but allows organizations to host the platform on their own infrastructure. This setup is ideal for companies that require more control over their data, enhanced security, and customization to meet internal compliance and regulatory requirements.\nThe authentication bypass vulnerability impacts GHES when using SAML single sign-on with encrypted assertions. An attacker can trigger the issue to forge SAML responses, granting them site administrator privileges without prior authentication.\n\u201cOn instances that use SAML single sign-on (SSO) authentication with the optional encrypted assertions feature, an attacker could forge a SAML response to provision and/or gain access to a user with administrator privileges.\u201d reads the advisory published by the company. \u201cPlease note that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default. Instances not utilizing SAML SSO or utilizing SAML SSO authentication without encrypted assertions are not impacted. Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow unauthorized access to the instance without requiring prior authentication.\u201d\nThe company pointed out that encrypted assertions are not enabled by default and that the vulnerability only affects installs using SAML single sign-on (SSO) or those that use SAML SSO authentication with encrypted assertions. Encrypted assertions are a security measure that allows encrypting the messages that the SAML identity provider (IdP) sends SAML SSO.\nThe vulnerability affected all GHES versions before 3.13.0 and was addressed with the release of versions 3.9.15, 3.10.12, 3.11.10, and 3.12.4.

This new configuration option brings you more flexibility in getting access to the latest SQL engine features with no additional cost or extra downtime.\n \nWith the new feature, you can choose between two update policies:\n\nAlways-up to date is a more agile policy, with cloud-native way of delivering new SQL engine features as soon as they are ready in Azure. It enables you to always be at the forefront \u2013 to quickly adopt new engine features, benefit from them in everyday operations and keep a competitive edge without waiting for the next major release of SQL Server.\n\n\nSQL Server 2022 policy offers a more traditional approach to updates, following the Cumulative Update (CU) releases of SQL Server 2022. Your managed instance gets security patches, fixes, and functional improvements of the existing comprehensive set of SQL engine features through regular service updates.\n\n \nRegardless of the update policy chosen, you continue to benefit from Azure SQL platform innovation. Improvements and new features not related to the SQL engine such as zone redundancy, instance stop/start capability, networking and connectivity improvements, business continuity, new hardware generations and the like \u2013 everything that makes Azure SQL Managed Instance a true PaaS service \u2013 will continue to be delivered to your Azure SQL Managed Instance resources, bringing it to new heights of efficiency, resilience, performance, security, and control.\n \nConfiguring update policy for an existing managed instance\n \nNow that we\u2019ve covered the basics, let\u2019s dive into the specifics of each update policy.\n \nAlways-up-to-date policy\nIt\u2019s a fast lane - unique to Azure - for getting access to new SQL engine features without waiting for the next major release of SQL Server. Quality assurance process and safe deployment practices of Azure are strictly followed, making new features ready for production use as soon as they reach general availability. Regular service updates bring smaller or larger new features, but also security patches, fixes, and functional improvements of the existing features. Azure SQL Database inherently applies Always-up-to-date policy since the inception of the service more than a decade ago.\n \nThe underlying database format evolves with some of the new features introduced, making it gradually diverge from the database format used by the latest major release of SQL Server. Due to the database format mismatch some means of copying a database from managed instance with Always-up-to-date policy configured to a SQL Server instance are not available, while the same operations in the opposite direction remain available. This applies to restore of a database backup and to database replication using managed instance link feature based on the Always On technology. Alternative means of copying a managed instance database to SQL Server remain available, like data export/import, transactional replication, or using Azure Data Factory service.\n \nYou can configure Always-up-date policy during instance creation, or you can change the policy of your existing managed instance to Always-up-to-date as long as the instance is enabled for November 2022 feature wave. Once Always-up-to-date policy is configured for a managed instance, it cannot be changed since database format cannot be downgraded.\nAs an illustration of a new SQL engine feature exclusive to instances with Always-up-to-date policy configured, check External REST Endpoint Invocation. More features are coming soon.\n \nSQL Server 2022 policy\nAs its name suggests, the SQL Server 2022 update policy follows the mainstream servicing lifecycle of SQL Server 2022. Regular service updates bring cumulative update (CU) payload consisting of security patches, fixes, and functional improvements of the existing features. No new SQL engine features get delivered.\n \nThanks to the database format alignment, instances with this update policy configured enjoy easier database mobility to SQL Server 2022 instances. Restoring a database backup and database replication using the link feature are available in both directions between managed instance with SQL Server 2022 update policy configured and SQL Server 2022 instance.\n \nAll existing managed instances have this policy configured. It\u2019s also the default update policy for newly created instances. It can be changed to Always-up-to-date policy during creation of the instance, or for existing instances with November 2022 feature wave enabled. The update policy cannot be changed back from Always-up-to-date to SQL Server 2022 because database format cannot be downgraded, just like database from SQL Server 2017 cannot be restored or Always On replicated to SQL Server 2016. That\u2019s why SQL Server 2022 is configured as the default update policy.\n \nThe policy remains available until the end of mainstream support for SQL Server 2022. Upon expiry of the mainstream support period, instances with SQL Server 2022 update policy configured will be automatically upgraded to update policy corresponding to the latest SQL Server major release at that time, colloquially referred to as \u201cSQL Server vNext\u201d. With the new update policy configured, instances will also get access to the entire set of SQL engine features introduced with vNext. The database compatibility level remains unchanged, protecting you from unwanted behavior changes of the existing features.\n \nWhich update policy is the right choice for me?\nIf you don\u2019t care about restoring database backups from your instance to SQL Server, or establishing near real-time database replication to SQL Server, then Always-up-to-date policy is the right choice for you. You will keep getting access to new SQL engine features. While you may have no interest in or have no time for adopting some of those features in your solutions, some other features will automatically bring benefits. As an example, think of potential future features improving resiliency or performance, like accelerated database recovery or optimized locking did in the past.\n \nIf you have regulatory compliance, contractual, or other reasons important to you for copying databases from managed instance to SQL Server, consider using SQL Server 2022 update policy and staying with the current set of SQL engine features. You can still achieve it with Always-up-to-date policy configured using alternative features like database export/import or transactional replication, or services like Azure Data Factory.\n \nIf you are not sure what are all the requirements for your solution \u2013 take your time and start with SQL Server 2022 update policy. You can switch to Always-up-to-date policy later if that turns out to be the right choice and you identify new features that you\u2019d like to adopt as soon as possible.\n \nYou can also use both update policies based on the requirements for each of your solutions and respective sets of managed instances. You may decide to configure Always-up-to-date policy in your development environment to have new features at hand and stay current with the new opportunities, and still use SQL Server 2022 update policy for the other environments if required.\nIf you plan to use both update policies within the same solution, check the limitations of cross-instance features used between instances with different update policies configured. They are typically related to point-in-time restore between two instances, or Always On based features like geo-replication using failover groups or database copying.\n\u00a0\nBest practices\n\nMake sure to add update policy configuration to your deployment templates, so that you don\u2019t rely on system defaults.\nBe aware that using some of the newly introduced features may require changing the database compatibility level.\nTo stay up-to-date with the latest feature additions to Azure SQL Managed Instance, subscribe to the Azure SQL video channel, subscribe to the Azure SQL Blog feed, or bookmark What\u2019s new in Azure SQL Managed Instance article with regular updates.\n\n\u00a0\nConclusion\nWhether you're all about staying ahead of the curve with brand new engine features, or happy with the existing comprehensive set of SQL engine features available in SQL Server 2022 and need easy database portability, we\u2019ve got you covered with the Update Policy choice for managed instance. Regardless of the update policy chosen, you keep getting benefits from all the innovations in Azure SQL platform.\n\u00a0\nFor more details visit Update policy documentation and stay tuned for the announcements of new SQL engine features coming to instances with Always-up-to-date policy configured.", "hash": "2e5b3487a52f8a0b792a7550fdf516d187489900d66d1da3ef20160137091791", "id": "46f24681-d6e9-4cf8-9593-40c04bbabd53", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sql-blog/update-policy-for-azure-sql-managed-instance/ba-p/4148968", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-22T10:00:07", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "10bd6852-18d4-4f30-afed-18f54a451e3e", "title": "Update Policy for Azure SQL Managed Instance"}], "tags": {"Always-up-date": {"name": "Always-up-date", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Always-up-to-date": {"name": "Always-up-to-date", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "SQL Server": {"name": "SQL Server", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Update Policy for Azure SQL Managed Instance"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-22T17:12:40.138154", "id": "93bf4493-86a4-4bd3-8e01-2c033946a0b6", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "4"}, {"created": "2024-05-22T17:08:36.480797", "id": "b9dab3df-0942-4148-9c86-a4161f2ebbca", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-22T10:00:00", "id": "f7a13b19-c15d-4f51-aa08-3252ce83d56c", "news_items": [{"author": "Sam Bocetta", "content": "The content of this post is solely the responsibility of the author. LevelBlue does not adopt or endorse any of the views, positions, or information provided by the author in this article.\nAs the world becomes increasingly digital, our online lives have become an extension of our physical selves. We share our thoughts and experiences through social media, communicate through messaging apps, keep our money online, and store precious memories and documents in the cloud.\nBut what happens to this vast digital footprint when we're gone?\nThe persistence of our online presence long after we've drawn our final breaths has given rise to a new frontier in data management \u2013 the digital afterlife.\nAs more of our personal information becomes digitized, it has become important to thoughtfully plan for the handling of this data. Gone are the days when we could neatly bequeath our earthly possessions to loved ones; now, we must grapple with the complex web of passwords, accounts, and digital assets that make up our modern-day legacies.\nWith personal data strewn across the internet, the risks of identity theft, privacy breaches, and unauthorized access to our digital lives will only continue to grow. Navigating this complex landscape of digital legacies is a delicate balance that requires thoughtful consideration.\nThe Scope of Digital Legacies\nWhen we think of legacies in a traditional sense, we imagine physical assets \u2013 houses, heirlooms, vehicles, cash, etc. However, virtual assets like social media accounts, email inboxes, online bank accounts, multimedia libraries, and cloud-based storage also represent critical components of a person's digital estate.\nThese virtual assets not only hold sentimental value in the form of memories, messages, and cherished media, but they may also contain sensitive financial and personal information that requires careful consideration after the owner's passing.\nImagine an elderly relative of yours has been dabbling in some deep-in-the-money options, and his account lies unprotected now that no one has official access to it. What\u2019s more, many asset protection strategies and plans don\u2019t consider digital accounts and non-traditional securities as something that\u2019s to be protected upon the passing of the owner. In such situations, the risk of losing your relative\u2019s wealth becomes all too real.\nThe Challenges of Managing Digital Legacies\nWhile digital assets have transformed how we think about personal legacies, they have also introduced a complex web of challenges that we must navigate with great care.\nLegal Considerations\nQuestions of ownership and access rights can be fuzzy, as traditional estate laws often fail to keep pace with the rapid evolution of technology. Additionally, different online platforms have varied terms of service that can complicate the execution of a will or the desires of the deceased\u2019s family.\nFurther complicating matters is the patchwork of privacy and data protection regulations that vary by jurisdiction, making it challenging to ensure the deceased's information is handled according to their wishes.\nEthical Dilemmas\nBeyond the legal landscape, managing digital legacies also presents a host of ethical considerations. Respecting the deceased's digital privacy can be particularly delicate, but what if a person\u2019s personal and business information were directly intertwined?\nImagine the cononundrums that could arise if a family member inherited the devices of a rich oil tycoon. They could steal confidential information about the company, but the reverse is possible, too\u2014the person\u2019s company claiming the device and getting access to his personal information. And the worst part? The law isn\u2019t remotely prepared to tackle cases like this one.\nCybersecurity Concerns\nManagement of digital legacies must also contend with the ever-present threat of cybersecurity breaches. Securing access to online accounts and digital repositories, protecting against identity theft or corruption, and ensuring the long-term integrity and confidentiality of digital assets are all essential considerations.\nAs the volume and complexity of personal data continue growing, the need for comprehensive cybersecurity strategies will become increasingly important. Your loved one who passed away might have taken care of their data, but what if someone attacks their financial institution? Hence, defenses must be fortified across the board.\nDigital Service Providers and Posthumous Data Management\nAs the custodians of our vast digital footprints, digital service providers like social media platforms, email services, and cloud-based storage platforms have a huge influence over what happens to our online presence after we pass away.\nEach platform has its own approach to handling user accounts and data following the death of an account holder. Social media giants like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have implemented various mechanisms to allow for the memorialization or deactivation of profiles.\nMeanwhile, email providers like Google and Microsoft outline clear procedures for dealing with the accounts of deceased users. These procedures often involve providing documentation like death certificates to access or close the deceased\u2019s accounts, balancing between user privacy and the needs of the bereaved.\nSimilarly, cloud storage providers and online repositories such as Dropbox and Google Drive often require careful documentation and verification before allowing the transfer or deletion of a deceased user's files.\nAs we entrust more and more of our personal information to these digital service providers, it becomes important to understand their policies and ensure that our digital legacies are handled as we wish.\nStrategies for Digital Estate Planning\nThis topic is still in its nascent phase, but the level of complexity is increasing by the day. Hence, even your average layman could use a nugget of knowledge or two pertaining to data science, and how their untimely death may impact the privacy of their data, but also the lives of their loved ones. Some strategies you can implement to proactively plan and manage your digital afterlife include:\nDocumenting Digital Assets and Access Information\nThe first step in effective digital estate planning is to create a comprehensive inventory of all digital assets, from social media accounts and email inboxes to online banking portals and cloud-based storage. For each asset, record the relevant login credentials, account numbers, and be sure to send a copy of this inventory to your lawyer.\nDesignating Digital Executors or Legacy Contacts\nJust as you would appoint an executor for a physical estate, it\u2019s wise to designate a digital executor or legacy contact \u2013 someone trusted to handle your digital assets according to your instructions. This person should be tech-savvy and clearly understand your wishes regarding the disposal or maintenance of your digital presence.\nLeveraging Digital Will and Trust Tools\nEmerging digital will and trust platforms offer innovative solutions for codifying and securing one's digital estate plan. These services allow you to create legally binding documents that outline the distribution of digital assets, grant access privileges to designated individuals, and even provide for the deletion or preservation of specific online content.\nRegularly Reviewing and Updating Digital Estate Plans\nAs with any estate plan, estate plans shouldn\u2019t be static; they need to evolve as new digital assets are acquired or existing accounts are closed. For instance, when you make a website for your online business or start purchasing all kinds of stocks, you need to add these to your digital asset inventory. This helps mitigate the risk of outdated or conflicting instructions.\nSecuring Digital Assets\nUnderlying all of these strategies is the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures. Password managers and various iterations of encryption tech, combined ML algorithms and various data protection protocols, can help safeguard digital assets and prevent unauthorized access or data breaches that could compromise your virtual afterlife.\nLegal Frameworks and Recent Developments\nTraditional estate laws have struggled to keep pace with the proliferation of digital assets, often failing to provide clear guidance on the ownership, access, and transfer of online accounts, data repositories, and virtual property.\nHowever, a growing number of jurisdictions have begun to address these gaps, introducing new legislation and regulations to clarify the legal status of digital legacies.\nIn the US, for example, the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (RUFADAA) has been adopted by most states. It grants fiduciaries legal authority to manage digital assets according to the user\u2019s estate plan while respecting privacy and consent.\nStill, not all countries have comprehensive laws regarding digital estate management, often leaving gaps in how digital assets are handled after death.\nThe Role of Cybersecurity in Honoring Digital Wishes\nThe importance of cybersecurity in protecting digital assets posthumously is also becoming more critical. Proper cybersecurity practices are essential to preserve and protect a lifetime's digital accumulations according to the deceased\u2019s wishes.\nSome key cybersecurity measures you can implement to protect digital legacies effectively include:\n\u25cf Strong authentication protocols: Utilizing multi-factor authentication for accounts ensures access is securely controlled and less prone to breaches.\n\u25cf Encryption: By encrypting sensitive data associated with digital assets such as emails, documents, and personal information, you can protect this data against hacking and unauthorized access.\n\u25cf Clear legal guidance and compliance: Ensuring that all cybersecurity measures comply with current legal standards and privacy laws is crucial for protecting against potential legal issues that could arise from mismanagement of digital legacies.\nWrapping Up\nAs our lives become deeply intertwined with the digital world, managing our digital afterlife is no longer a mere consideration; it's a necessity.

If I open the YouTube Music app, start playing a song, and then tap the cast icon, I can select \"Nest Hubs\" to start playback on both my Nest Hubs simultaneously.\nIf I keep the YouTube Music app open, I can control the volume of my speaker group by pressing the volume keys on my phone. This functionality is available no matter what device I use. However, if I open another app while YouTube Music is casting, whether I'm able to still control the volume of my speaker group using my phone's volume keys depends on what phone I'm using and what software version it's running. If I'm using a Pixel phone that's running a software version before Android 15 Beta 2, then I'm unable to control the volume of my speaker group unless I re-open the YouTube Music app. If I'm using a phone from any other manufacturer, then I won't have any issues controlling the volume of my speaker group.\nThe reason for this weird discrepancy is that Google intentionally blocked Pixel devices from being able to control the volume of Google Home speaker groups while casting. Google did this out of an abundance of caution while they were fighting a legal dispute.

By 2009 Google had already announced and released some of this functionality, so without the link back to 2006 the latter patents were invalid anyway due to prior art.\nThe judge also pointed out that Sonos waited an unreasonably long amount of time to bring the dispute up. They did not file full applications until 2019. It's not unusual to file a provisional application just to establish that something was invented and give a little more time to produce all the documentation needed, but 13 years is ridiculous. By the time they filed the industry had already widely adopted the technology and there were many products on the market with it.\nThe law doesn't allow you to file a provisional patent application for a thing, wait until someone else invents it, and then flesh out your own application so you can sue them.\nI don't get what was original (Score:2)\nwith this patent except if you add with a computer or with an app. Grouping sound input and output is what mixers were invented to perform back in the analogue days.

However, security software that \u201conly occasionally\u201d gets critical things wrong will still have quite a negative impact, either spewing massive false positives triggering security teams to scramble unnecessarily, or missing a malicious attack that looks \u201cjust different enough\u201d from malware that the AI already knew about.\nThis is why we\u2019ve been layering it with a host of other technologies to provide checks and balances. That way, if AI\u2019s answer is akin to digital hallucination, we can reel it back in with the rest of the stack of technologies.\nWhile adversaries haven\u2019t launched many pure AI attacks, it\u2019s more correct to think of adversarial AI automating links in the attack chain to be more effective, especially at phishing and now voice and image cloning from phishing to supersize social engineering efforts. If bad actors can gain confidence digitally and trick systems into authenticating using AI-generated data, that\u2019s enough of a beachhead to get into your organization and begin launching custom exploit tools manually.\nTo stop this, vendors can layer multifactor authentication, so attackers need multiple (hopefully time-sensitive) authentication methods, rather than just a voice or password. While that technology is now widely deployed, it is also widely underutilized by users. This is a simple way users can protect themselves without a heavy lift or a big budget.\nIs AI at fault? When asked for justification when AI gets it wrong, people simply quipped \u201cit\u2019s complicated\u201d. But as AI gets closer to the ability to cause physical harm and impact the real world, it\u2019s no longer a satisfying and adequate response. For example, if an AI-powered self-driving car gets into an accident, does the \u201cdriver\u201d get a ticket, or the manufacturer? It\u2019s not an explanation likely to satisfy a court to hear how complicated and opaque it might be.\nWhat about privacy? We\u2019ve seen GDPR rules clamp down on tech-gone-wild as viewed through the lens of privacy. Certainly AI-derived, sliced and diced original works yielding derivatives for gain smacks afoul of the spirit of privacy \u2013 and therefore would trigger protective laws \u2013 but exactly how much does AI have to copy for it to be considered derivative, and what if it copies just enough to skirt legislation?\nAlso, how would anyone prove it in court, with but scant case law that will take years to become better tested legally? We see newspaper publishers suing Microsoft and OpenAI over what they believe is high-tech regurgitation of articles without due credit; it will be interesting to see the outcome of the litigation, perhaps a foreshadowing of future legal actions.\nMeanwhile, AI is a tool \u2013 and often a good one \u2013 but with great power comes great responsibility. The responsibility of AI\u2019s providers right now lags woefully behind what\u2019s possible if our new-found power goes rogue.\nWhy not also read this new white paper from ESET that reviews the risks and opportunities of AI for cyber-defenders?", "hash": "eae4678461c0a1e8b3055c0960afcce9585d148328b856749bb3385241977498", "id": "1e1bd472-da39-4b04-8ba2-688d3e611de3", "link": "https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/cybersecurity/what-happens-ai-goes-rogue-how-stop-it/", "osint_source_id": "656b41df-746e-4b73-9d67-b9ba0e3d9f8b", "published": "2024-05-22T09:30:00", "source": "https://feeds.feedburner.com/eset/blog?format=xml", "story_id": "19cee6a3-8d18-43fa-a9e9-b3dc91f566fe", "title": "What happens when AI goes rogue (and how to stop it)"}], "tags": {"AI-derived": {"name": "AI-derived", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ESET": {"name": "ESET", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "New York": {"name": "New York", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "OpenAI": {"name": "OpenAI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "phishing": {"name": "phishing", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "What happens when AI goes rogue (and how to stop it)"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-22T17:08:38.929024", "id": "4dd86d9c-04ac-4134-a88b-a974285a6128", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "4"}, {"created": "2024-05-22T17:14:59.971499", "id": "8039d4c6-dd2a-40d3-a4ff-e27ad6d864cc", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "28"}], "created": "2024-05-22T09:25:37", "id": "739ad330-c3bf-425d-a1ca-f889cd757faf", "news_items": [{"author": "Bill Toulas", "content": "Chinese hackers hide on military and govt networks for 6 years\nBill Toulas\nMay 22, 2024\n-\n09:25 AM\n-\n0\n-\nA previously unknown threat actor dubbed \"Unfading Sea Haze\" has been targeting military and government entities in the South China Sea region since 2018, remaining undetected all this time.\nBitdefender researchers who discovered the threat group report that its operations align with Chinese geo-political interests, focusing on intelligence collection and espionage.\nAs is typical for Chinese state-sponsored threat actors, \"Unfading Sea Haze\" demonstrates operational, TTP, and toolset overlaps with other activity clusters, most notably, APT41.\nAbusing MSBuild for fileless malware\nUnfading Sea Haze attacks start with spear-phishing emails carrying malicious ZIP archives that contain LNK files disguised as documents.\nAs of March 2024, the latest lures used in these attacks concern U.S. political topics, while the ZIPs were deceptively named to appear as Windows Defender installers/updaters.\nThese LNK files contain a long obfuscated PowerShell command that will check for the presence of an ESET executable, ekrn.exe, and if it exists, halts the attack.\nIf the executable is not found, the PowerShell script will perform an interesting trick to launch fileless malware directly into memory using Microsoft's legitimate msbuild.exe command-line compiler.\n\"In this attack, the criminals start a new MSBuild process with a twist: they specify a working directory located on a remote SMB server (like \\154.90.34.83\\exchange\\info in the above example),\" explains Bitdefender.\n\"By setting the working directory to a remote location, MSBuild will search for a project file on that remote server. If a project file is found, MSBuild will execute the code it contains entirely in memory, leaving no traces on the victim's machine.\"\nThat code executed by MSBuild is a backdoor program named 'SerialPktdoor,' which gives the attackers remote control over the compromised system.\nThe attack also employs scheduled tasks that execute innocuous files to side-load malicious DLLs and use local administrator account manipulation to maintain persistence.\nSpecifically, the hackers reset the password for the local administrator account, which is disabled by default in Windows, and enable it. The account is then again hidden from the login screen via Registry modifications.\nThis provides the threat actors with a hidden admin account that can be used to further their attacks.\nBitdefender highlights the atypical strategy of using commercial Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools, like the Itarian RMM, in the attack chain to gain a foothold on the compromised network.\nUnfading Sea Haze's Arsenal\nOnce access has been established, Unfading Sea Haze uses a custom keylogger named 'xkeylog' to capture the victim's keystrokes, an info-stealer targeting data stored in Chrome, Firefox, or Edge, and various PowerShell scripts that extract information from the browser database.\nStarting in 2023, the hackers moved to stealthier tools like the abuse of msbuild.exe to load C# payloads from remote SMB shares, as well as variants of the Gh0stRAT malware.\nBitdefender has seen the deployment of:\nSilentGh0st \u2013 The oldest variant offering extensive functionality through a rich set of commands and modules\n-\nInsidiousGh0st \u2013 Go-based evolution of SilentGh0st that also features TCP proxy, SOCKS5, and PowerShell improvements.\n-\nTranslucentGh0st, EtherealGh0st, and FluffyGh0st \u2013 Newest variants featuring dynamic plugin loading and lighter footprint for evasive operation.\n-\nIn earlier attacks, the hacker also used Ps2dllLoader, a tool that loads .NET or PowerShell code into memory, and 'SharpJSHandler,' a web shell that listens for HTTP requests and executes encoded JavaScript code.\nInterestingly, a custom tool checks for newly plugged USB and Windows Portable Devices (WPD) every ten seconds and sends device details and specific files to the attackers.\nTo exfiltrate data from breached systems, Unfading Sea Haze uses a custom tool named 'DustyExfilTool' that performs secure data extraction via TLS over TCP.\nMore recent attacks show that the threat actors have switched to a curl utility and the FTP protocol for data exfiltration, now also using dynamically generated credentials that are changed frequently.\nUnfading Sea Haze shows stealth, persistence, and adaptability, leveraging fileless attacks, advanced evasion methods, and modular malware design.\nTo stop these attacks, organizations must adopt a multifaceted security strategy involving patch management, MFA adoption, network segmentation, traffic monitoring, and deployment of state-of-the-art detection and response products.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

Die Betr\u00fcger*innen passen ihr Vorgehen dabei immer wieder leicht an, um ihre Opfer hinters Licht zu f\u00fchren. Eine Masche, die in \u00e4hnlicher Form bereits seit einigen Wochen in Deutschland kursiert, schwappt nun auch offenbar immer mehr nach \u00d6sterreich \u00fcber, wie der futurezone von mehreren Leser*innen berichtet wurde.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Neue Welle an betr\u00fcgerischen \"Amazon\"-Anrufen\n\u201cIhr Paypal-Konto wird mit einer Zahlung von 999 Euro belastet. Dr\u00fccken Sie 1, um die Zahlung zu genehmigen, 2, um sie zu stornieren\u201d, hei\u00dft es darin in einer Tonbandansage sinngem\u00e4\u00df. Was man dr\u00fcckt, ist unerheblich, man wird danach in jedem Fall in ein Callcenter weitergeleitet. Ein vermeintlicher PayPal-Mitarbeiter versucht dann, pers\u00f6nliche Daten auszusp\u00e4hen.\nVergleichbare Anrufe, die tats\u00e4chlich von PayPal stammen, gibt es nicht. Eine Unternehmenssprecherin sagte gegen\u00fcber der Verbraucherzentrale in Deutschland, dass \"PayPal seine Kunden in der Regel nicht anruft \u2013 und schon gar nicht mit der Aufforderung, Zahlungen zu leisten\".\nSofort auflegen\nDarum ist es ratsam, sofort aufzulegen und keine Taste zu dr\u00fccken. Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich sollte man schon gar keine pers\u00f6nlichen Daten, Kontonummern, Passw\u00f6rter oder dergleichen weitergeben, wenn man ungefragt angerufen und danach gefragt wird.\nAm besten w\u00e4re nat\u00fcrlich erst gar nicht abzuheben, allerdings ist ein Spam-Anruf anhand der Nummer nur schwer als solcher zu erkennen. Grund daf\u00fcr ist, dass die Betr\u00fcger*innen Caller-ID-Spoofing nutzen. Dabei wird die Nummer der meist im Ausland sitzenden Anrufer verschleiert. Stattdessen steht eine \u00f6sterreichische Nummer auf dem Display. Die Nummer kann dabei tats\u00e4chlich real sein, die Besitzer*innen bekommen davon gar nichts mit.

With Recall on the new Copilot+ PCs, users no longer need to manage and remember their own browsing and chat activity. Instead, by regularly taking and storing screenshots of a user\u2019s activity, the Copilot+ PCs can comb through that visual data to deliver answers to natural language questions, such as \u201cFind the site with the white sneakers,\u201d and \u201cblue pantsuit with a sequin lace from abuelita.\u201d\nAs any regularly updated repository of device activity poses an enormous security threat\u2014imagine hackers getting access to a Recall database and looking for, say, Social Security Numbers, bank account info, and addresses\u2014Microsoft has said that all Recall screenshots are encrypted and stored locally on a device.\nBut, in terms of security, that\u2019s about all users will get, as Recall will not detect and obscure passwords, shy away from recording pornographic material, or turn a blind eye to sensitive information.\n\u201cNote that Recall does not perform content moderation. It will not hide information such as passwords or financial account numbers. That data may be in snapshots that are stored on your device, especially when sites do not follow standard internet protocols like cloaking password entry.\u201d\nThe consequences of such a system could be enormous.\nWith Recall, a CEO\u2019s personal laptop could become an even more enticing target for hackers equipped with infostealers, a journalist\u2019s protected sources could be within closer grasp of an oppressive government that isn\u2019t afraid to target dissidents with malware, and entire identities could be abused and impersonated by a separate device user.\nIn fact, Recall seems to only work best in a one-device-per-person world. Though Microsoft explained that its Copilot+ PCs will only record Recall snapshots to specific device accounts, plenty of people share devices and accounts. For the domestic abuse survivor who is forced to share an account with their abuser, for the victim of theft who\u2014like many people\u2014used a weak device passcode that can easily be cracked, and for the teenager who questions their identity on the family computer, Recall could be more of a burden than a benefit.\nFor Malwarebytes General Manager of Consumer Business Unit Mark Beare, Recall raises yet another issue:\n\u201cI worry that we are heading to a social media 2.0 like world.\u201d\nWhen users first raced to upload massive quantities of sensitive, personal data onto social media platforms more than 10 years ago, they couldn\u2019t predict how that data would be scrutinized in the future, or how it would be scoured and weaponized by cybercriminals, Beare said.\n\u201cWith AI there will be a strong pull to put your full self into a model (so it knows you),\u201d Beare said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy to understand all the negative aspects of what can happen from doing that and how bad actors can benefit.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t just report on threats \u2013 we help safeguard your entire digital identity\nCybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

Firmenchef Satya Nadella hatte einige Neuerungen im Gep\u00e4ck. Vieles davon hatte mit K\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz (KI) zu tun, hier ein \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die wichtigsten Ank\u00fcndigungen der Build:\n1 - Copilot+ PCs\nGemeinsam mit Hardware-Partnern will Microsoft k\u00fcnftig Copilot+ PCs anbieten. Dabei handelt es sich um Rechner mit spezieller Hardware, um KI-Aufgaben lokal berechnen zu k\u00f6nnen. Die Ger\u00e4te m\u00fcssen eine Neural Processing Unit (NPU) haben, die mindestens 40 TOPs (Trillion Operations per Second) schaffen. Zudem m\u00fcssen sie mindestens 16GB RAM und 256GB Speicherplatz aufweisen. Erste Partner f\u00fcr das Projekt sind Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP und Lenovo. Zudem hat Microsoft laut eigenen Angaben Windows 11 f\u00fcr den Betrieb auf ARM-Chips optimiert.\nKI-Berechnungen lokal abzuwickeln, hat mehrere Vorteile. So ist es einerseits schneller als in der Cloud, zudem m\u00fcssen keine (potenziell pers\u00f6nlichen) Daten daf\u00fcr \u00fcbertragen werden. F\u00fcr Microsoft hat es den Vorteil, dass die kostenintensiven Rechenprozesse zum Teil auf die Ger\u00e4te der Kund*innen ausgelagert werden k\u00f6nnen.\nZuletzt haben wir vermehrt Ger\u00e4te mit der F\u00e4higkeit gesehen, KI-Anwendungen lokal auszuf\u00fchren. Darunter etwa auch Smartphones (etwa Googles Pixel) oder Tablets (neue iPads).\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Googles g\u00fcnstiges Pixel 8a ist da\n2 - Neue Surface-Modelle\nNeu pr\u00e4sentiert wurde auch die aktuelle Generation an Surface-Laptops auf ARM-Basis mit dem neuen Snapdragon X Elite Chipsatz. Das Ger\u00e4t soll eine modernere Optik mit d\u00fcnneren R\u00e4ndern um das Display aufweisen. Die Bildschirmdiagonale betr\u00e4gt 13,8 bzw. 15 Zoll. Laut Microsoft ist es \u00fcber 86 Prozent schneller, Surface Laptop 5 und verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber bis zu 32 GB RAM und bis zu 1 TB SSD-Speicher.\nDer Wechsel auf ARM soll sich besonders positiv auf die Akkulaufzeit auswirken. Das 15-Zoll-Modell soll mit einer Ladung 22 Stunden lang Video abspielen durchhalten. Beim Browsen sollen es immerhin noch 15 Stunden sein. Das neue Tablet Surface Pro kommt mit OLED und 2 USB-C-Steckpl\u00e4tzen.\n3 - KI-Assistent f\u00fcr Unternehmen\nMicrosofts Copilot KI-Assistent soll k\u00fcnftig als virtueller Mitarbeiter agieren. Dabei soll er einfache Aufgaben \u00fcbernehmen k\u00f6nnen, f\u00fcr die es bislang Menschen gebraucht hat, wie etwa Dateneingabe. Dass die KI tats\u00e4chlich Arbeitspl\u00e4tze ersetzt, will Microsoft aber nicht sagen, es sollen nur die monotonen, langweiligen Aufgaben automatisiert werden.\nDas Feature erinnert an das, was Google vergangene Woche im Rahmen der I/O vorgestellt hat. Auch in Workspace k\u00f6nnen k\u00fcnftig ebenfalls \u201cvirtual Teammates\u201d erstellt werden. Man kann dann etwa direkt \u00fcber Chat mit ihnen kommunizieren und sie Meetings, Unterhaltungen und Dokumenten hinzuf\u00fcgen.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Die 9 wichtigsten Ank\u00fcndigungen der Google I/O\n4 - Edge \u00fcbersetzt YouTube-Videos\nEbenfalls mit KI funktioniert das neue Feature des Microsoft-Browsers Edge. Videos von Webseiten wie YouTube oder LinkedIn k\u00f6nnen in Echtzeit \u00fcbersetzt werden. Das soll zu Beginn mit einigen wenigen Sprachen funktionieren, darunter aber auch Deutsch. Laut Microsoft ist das Feature \u201cbald\u201d verf\u00fcgbar, weitere Webseiten und Sprachen sollen nachfolgen.\n5 - KI-gest\u00fctztes Copy-and-paste\nDas gute alte Kopiere-und-Einf\u00fcgen wird ebenfalls mit KI aufgemotzt. Advanced Paste kann Inhalte aus der Zwischenablage mithilfe von KI modifizieren bzw. konvertieren. So kann man direkt als Klartext, Markdown oder JSON einf\u00fcgen, ohne, dass man es manuell umschreiben kann. Der Nachteil: Daf\u00fcr braucht man einen OpenAI-API-Schl\u00fcssel und Guthaben auf dem eigenen OpenAI-Konto.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Microsoft vernachl\u00e4ssigt eigenen Klimaschutzplan\n6 - Copilot gibt Minecraft-Tipps\nEtwas spielerisch ist diese neue Funktion von Copilot: So kann der KI-Assistent k\u00fcnftig Tipps beim Gaming geben. Als Beispiel zeigte Microsoft Minecraft. Die KI nimmt dabei auf, was am Bildschirm passiert und sagt den Spieler*innen dann, was sie bestenfalls tun sollen. Laut Microsoft k\u00f6nnen k\u00fcnftig auch andere Spiele unterst\u00fctzt werden, wie etwa der Flight Simulator. Etwas heikel k\u00f6nnte es hier bei Online-Multiplayer-Games werden, wenn sich die Frage stellt, inwieweit der KI-Assistent schon Cheaten ist.\nKommentare", "hash": "0eb437af607251d750acaa1cc571142a01b22a20ea4b38cba6e17cb5c0c7c62c", "id": "85e36af9-766e-4154-b023-589b5694f64d", "link": "https://futurezone.at/produkte/microsoft-build-2024-keynote-satya-nadella-kuenstliche-intelligenz/402903192", "osint_source_id": "eec2ad26-2f4c-4dd8-a3e5-08c0eb3765ca", "published": "2024-05-22T08:23:35", "source": "https://futurezone.at/xml/rss", "story_id": "13a407cb-b01b-439a-8680-d5ae0a77bca6", "title": "Build 2024: 6 Dinge, die Microsoft vorgestellt hat"}], "tags": {"Acer": {"name": "Acer", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Asus": {"name": "Asus", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Dell": {"name": "Dell", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "JSON": {"name": "JSON", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Lenovo": {"name": "Lenovo", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Satya Nadella": {"name": "Satya Nadella", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Surface Pro": {"name": "Surface Pro", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Windows 11": {"name": "Windows 11", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Build 2024: 6 Dinge, die Microsoft vorgestellt hat"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-22T09:15:45.615899", "id": "7390087b-f8a0-4d94-844a-8de92a33f423", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-22T09:17:24.512682", "id": "f8a8f1c3-4aa3-4d14-8c21-f6d45a12a4f1", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-22T08:22:45", "id": "b3ac3234-1ead-4ceb-af13-6f08de2ef4c9", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "In Deutschland f\u00fchlt sich jede und jeder Zweite von der Nachrichtenflut im Internet \u00fcberfordert.

Depending on where you live, you might even get a decent view. But what if you wanted a truly unique vantage point? You could replicate the work of [Tarik Agcayazi] and [kemfic], who set about filming the recent eclipse from an altitude of 80,000 feet.\nThe duo didn\u2019t rent a high-performance aircraft from the US military. Instead, they relied on a high-altitude balloon carrying a glider with a camera payload. The idea was for the balloon to go up, and have the camera capture the eclipse. Then, it would be released so that it could glide back home in controlled flight. However, time constraints made that too hard. Instead, they simplified to a parachute recovery method.\nThe project video covers the development process, the balloon launch itself, and of course, the filming of the eclipse. High altitude balloon launches are stressful enough, but having a short eclipse as a target made everything even more difficult. But that just makes things more exciting!\nThe project builds on earlier work from the duo that we discussed back in 2017.\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

In 2023, OmniVision employed 2,200 people and had an annual revenue of $1.4 billion. OmniVision Technologies Inc. is an American subsidiary of Chinese semiconductor device and mixed-signal integrated circuit design house Will Semiconductor. The company designs and develops digital imaging products for use in mobile phones, laptops, netbooks and webcams, security and surveillance cameras, entertainment, automotive and medical imaging systems.\nIn 2023, the imaging sensors manufacturer was the victim of a Cactus ransomware attack.\nLast week, OmniVision notified the California Office of the Attorney General. The threat actors had access to the company systems between September 4 and September 30, 2023, when they deployed ransomware.\n\u201cOn September 30, 2023, OVT became aware of a security incident that resulted in the encryption of certain OVT systems by an unauthorized third party. In response to this incident, we promptly launched a comprehensive investigation with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity experts and notified law enforcement. At the same time, we took proactive measures to remove the unauthorized party and ensure the security of OVT systems.\u201d reads the data Breach Notification. \u201cThis in-depth investigation determined that an unauthorized party took some personal information from certain systems between September 4, 2023, and September 30, 2023. On April 3, 2024, after completion of this comprehensive review, we determined that some of your personal information was involved.\u201d\nAt this time is unclear the number of the impacted individuals.\nIn October, 2023, the Cactus ransomware group added OmniVision to the list of victims on its Tor leak site. As proof of the data breach, the extortion group published data samples, including passport images, NDAs, contracts, and other documents.\nThen, after the failure of the alleged negotiation, the gang released all the stolen data for free, however, OmniVision is currently no longer listed on the Cactus ransom leak site.\nAs a result of the incident, OmniVision implemented more monitoring solutions to detect suspicious activity and prevent recurrence. The company is also updating security policies, migrating some systems to the cloud, and requiring additional security awareness training. Although there is no evidence of fraudulent use of the personal information of the impacted individuals, the company is offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity restoration services for 24 months.\nThe Cactus ransomware operation has been active since March 2023, Kroll researchers reported that the ransomware strain is notable for the use of encryption to protect the ransomware binary.\nCactus ransomware uses the SoftPerfect Network Scanner (netscan) to look for other targets on the network along with PowerShell commands to enumerate endpoints. The ransomware identifies user accounts by viewing successful logins in Windows Event Viewer, it also uses a modified variant of the open-source PSnmap Tool.\nThe Cactus ransomware relies on multiple legitimate tools (e.g. Splashtop, AnyDesk, SuperOps RMM) to achieve remote access and uses Cobalt Strike and the proxy tool Chisel in post-exploitation activities.\nOnce the malware has escalated the privileges on a machine, the threat actors use a batch script to uninstall popular antivirus solutions installed on the machine.\nCactus uses the Rclone tool for data exfiltration and used a PowerShell script called TotalExec, which was used in the past by BlackBasta ransomware operators, to automate the deployment of the encryption process.\nIn early January, the Cactus ransomware group claimed to have hacked Coop, one of the largest retail and grocery providers in Sweden.\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n(SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, data breach)", "hash": "dd313283398b6d55d51f3402a952e7e8bc27218f8223faddf4e2e818cf73213c", "id": "f2eaa188-7fc2-43d3-9aaa-159d7a81d907", "link": "https://securityaffairs.com/163506/data-breach/omnivision-data-breach.html", "osint_source_id": "d01d5487-bebf-40c5-a433-cdbe4670e633", "published": "2024-05-22T07:40:27", "source": "http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/feed", "story_id": "8336419d-75e4-4371-a4a7-c305552134c6", "title": "OmniVision disclosed a data breach after the 2023 Cactus ransomware attack"}], "tags": {"American": {"name": "American", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "AnyDesk": {"name": "AnyDesk", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Cactus": {"name": "Cactus", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Chinese": {"name": "Chinese", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Coop": {"name": "Coop", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Data breach": {"name": "Data breach", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "Mastodon": {"name": "Mastodon", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "NDAs": {"name": "NDAs", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "OVT": {"name": "OVT", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "OmniVision": {"name": "OmniVision", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "OmniVision Technologies Inc.": {"name": "OmniVision Technologies Inc.", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Security awareness training": {"name": "Security awareness training", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "Splashtop": {"name": "Splashtop", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "SuperOps RMM": {"name": "SuperOps RMM", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Sweden": {"name": "Sweden", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Will Semiconductor": {"name": "Will Semiconductor", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "OmniVision disclosed a data breach after the 2023 Cactus ransomware attack"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-22T09:12:55.770607", "id": "55f61d16-cc03-4c15-892d-b5d4587f8168", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "21"}, {"created": "2024-05-22T09:08:23.241506", "id": "c8fcf1a4-0223-4f6d-b4a9-6c022fc3c6b7", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-22T07:32:01", "id": "5c0b6981-f34c-44f3-b1f0-7fdf69cdb71b", "news_items": [{"author": "G\u00fcnter Born", "content": "Gerade gelesen, dass C. Gordon Bell, ein US-Computeringenieur, am 17. Mai 2024 im Alter von 89 Jahren verstorben ist. Wird vielen Lesern nichts sagen, mir auch nicht. Erst die Information, dass Bell in den 1960er Jahren bei DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation) arbeitete und dort f\u00fcr die Entwicklung der PDP\u2013 und in den 1970er Jahren der VAX-Computer leitete, lie\u00df was klingeln. Kleiner Ausflug in die Vergangenheit (ins vorige Jahrtausend) gef\u00e4llig?\nAnzeige\nDer Entwickler der PDP und VAX\nBei mir ist DEC zwar mit dem 2011 verstorbenen Ken Olsen als Gr\u00fcnder verankert \u2013 aber Bell war wohl der (Mit-) Entwickler der Rechner. Die PDP-1 der 60er Jahre war der Einstieg. Sp\u00e4ter kam die PDP-8 dazu, die ich noch kennen lernen durfte. Legend\u00e4r waren die PDP-11-Modelle, mit denen DEC in den sp\u00e4ten 70er und fr\u00fchen 80er Jahren Erfolg hatte. Dann kamen die VAX-Rechner, die als Arbeitspferde abseits der damaligen Mainframe-Rechner von IBM etc. galten. Das Ende kam, als DEC am 26. Januar 1998 an den Hersteller Compaq verkauft wurde \u2013 was ich aber nicht mehr so wirklich mitbekam, weil ich zu dieser Zeit bereits als IT-Autor auf MS-DOS und Windows unterwegs war und mit DEC nichts mehr am Hut hatte.\nVon der PDP \"wachgek\u00fcsst\"\nUnd damit bin ich mitten in meinen beruflichen Anfangsjahren. 1979, ein junger Ingenieurstudent will seine Diplomarbeit antreten. Es geht um eine optische Messeinrichtung f\u00fcr Schwefelverbindungen in der Atmosph\u00e4re, wo Licht einer starken Lampe \u00fcber Spiegel Kilometer-weit durch das Gel\u00e4nde geleitet wurde und dann im Labor mittels einer Fotodiodenzeile erfasst wurde. W\u00e4hrend solche Sensoren heute in jeder Kamera zu finden sind, gab es seinerzeit genau sechs dieser Fotodiodenzeilen der Firma Reticon mit jeweils 256 Fotodioden.\nWar ein bisschen Elektronik, ein bisschen Mechanik (der Empf\u00e4nger wurde auf -80 Grad Celsius heruntergek\u00fchlt) \u2013 und zur Auswertung stand da eine PDP-11/04 zur Verf\u00fcgung. Und der junge Ingenieurstudent musste mit staunenden Augen feststellen, dass Computer anfassbar und tragbar waren, und nicht mit Lochkarten gef\u00fcttert, sondern mit 8 Zoll-Floppy-Laufwerken f\u00fcr Betriebssystem und Datenerfassung ausgestattet waren. Eine zweite, \u00e4ltere PDP, musste dagegen noch mit Lochstreifen \"gef\u00fcttert werden\", um zu funktionieren. Und so hie\u00df es, die diversen Befehle wie Pip, Dir etc. des RT-11-Betriebssystems lernen, um die Maschine bedienen zu k\u00f6nnen.\nDas war wohl der Punkt, wo ich falsch abgebogen und auf die schr\u00e4ge Bahn geriet. Was h\u00e4tte f\u00fcr ein anst\u00e4ndiger Ingenieur aus mir werden k\u00f6nnen: Geniale Entw\u00fcrfe im Maschinenbau, irgendwas mit Physik (Laserphysik vielleicht), oder in der Medizintechnik neueste Ger\u00e4te bauen \u2013 alles stand mir offen. Aber ich wollte was mit DEC-Computern machen.\nIm sp\u00e4teren beruflichen Leben kamen dann weitere Dec Rechner hinzu. Da war eine PDP 11/04, auf der ich in Intran (einem Prozess-Fortran-Derivat der Firma Instron) Software f\u00fcr Bauteilebelastungstests im Flugzeugbau anpassen musste. Beim sp\u00e4teren Arbeitgeber in der Gro\u00dfchemie habe ich dann Systeme mit einer DEC PDP 11 (k\u00f6nnte eine 83 gewesen sein) f\u00fcr Automatisierungsaufgaben eingesetzt und VAX-Computer f\u00fcr die \u00dcberwachung und Betriebsleittechnik. Die Software, die ich in Fortran entwickeln lie\u00df, und die auf VAX-Systemen lief, f\u00fchrte mich sogar bis nach Japan und Thailand.\nAber ab so 1984 war das Thema DEC dann f\u00fcr mich als Entwickler bereits auf dem absteigenden Ast. Seit 1981 habe ich Intel 8085-Mikroprozessoren f\u00fcr Prozessteuerungen eingesetzt und entsprechende Software geschrieben. Und so 1984 m\u00fcssen dann die ersten IBM-PCs mit IBM-DOS und MS-DOS aufgekommen sein. Die PDP-11- und VAX-Systeme habe ich dann noch mit meinen Mitarbeitern in Projekten eingesetzt, aber nicht mehr selbst programmiert. Die PCs l\u00e4uteten dann auch das Ende der PDP 11-Rechner ein und auch f\u00fcr die VAX-Systeme gab es irgendwann keinen Bedarf mehr. Aber wie oben erw\u00e4hnt, diesen Niedergang habe ich nicht mehr wirklich miterlebt, weil ich seit 1993 als IT-Autor in der DOS-/Windows-Welt der Personal Computer unterwegs war.\nUnd so schlie\u00dft sich der Kreis: Mit der Nachricht, dass C. Gordon Bell die Tage verstorben ist, wurde ich in der Erinnerung in die absoluten Anf\u00e4nge meiner beruflichen Laufbahn zur\u00fcck gebeamt. War eine geniale Zeit \u2013 und Insider wissen, das sich Bill Gates noch als Sch\u00fcler an einem PDP-Rechner seiner Schule die ersten Meriten als Software-Entwickler erworben hat. Aber das war alles im \"vorherigen\" Leben \u2013 und nun ist diese Generation \"Rentner\" \u2013 wir werden h\u00f6chstens nochmals reaktiviert, wenn uralter COBOL-Programmcode umgeschrieben, oder die Bordsoftware der am Rand unseres Sonnensystems fliegenden Voyager-Raumsonden modifiziert werden muss.\nCookies blockieren entzieht uns die Finanzierung: Cookie-Einstellungen\nVon der PDF \"wachgek\u00fcsst\"? Schmunzel\u2026 PDP wie du sp\u00e4ter selbst schreibst\u2026\nUnd ein paar Worte zum \"Niedergang\" in den 80ern:\nEs war der VAX-Programmierer Cutler mit seinem Team, der mit seinem Fortgang von DEC zu MS das weitere Schicksal von DEC, MS und der ganzen Branche bestimmt hat. Er gab MS mit Windows NT ein System in einer Zeit, wo MS mehr Umsatz mit Unix Lizenzen (z.B. Sinix) machte als mit MS-DOS. Das erkl\u00e4rt auch die Unix und DEC Subsysteme in NT4. Denn DOS war ein L\u00fcckenf\u00fcller bis die PCs leistungsstark genug f\u00fcr Unix oder OS/2 w\u00e4ren. Aber beides waren unliebsame Varianten: Bei Unix h\u00e4tte MS selbst weiterhin Lizenzen zahlen m\u00fcssen, bei OS/2 h\u00e4tte man mit IBM jemanden anderen mit im Boot. Alles wurde daher auf NT gesetzt und mit Windows 2K final das Ziel auch erreicht. DOS war sp\u00e4testens ab diesem Zeitpunkt Geschichte.\nHabe letztes Jahr ebenfalls einen historischen Abriss gegeben:\nhttps://blog.jakobs.systems/blog/20230628-linux-cli/\nDer kernel von Windows erinnert heute noch sehr stark an VMS. Leider wurde das Drumherum mit Klicki-Schicki- total verhunzt, so da\u00df sich Windows nicht in dem Ma\u00dfe zur Proze\u00dfsteuerung eignet wie VMS. Aber die Zielgruppe war auch eine andere. Ich liebte die VAXen und VMS. Das unselige Ende von DEC kam dann mit Compaq. Schlie\u00dflich ist auch HP an derselben Ursache ins Bedeutungslose verschwunden.\nIch hatte in den 1980ern auch am Rande mit VAX Rechnern zu tun, aber prim\u00e4r habe ich auf Siemens MX 2 und sp\u00e4ter MX 300 programmiert, damals in COBOL.", "hash": "2e0b436b2128bc36c4b354473831be2206601f24c93155902bac8b9d9a61ffea", "id": "3618dbf8-0f47-4a62-a2e0-f566e6da4cb6", "link": "https://www.borncity.com/blog/2024/05/22/c-gordon-bell-entwickler-der-dec-pdps-mit-89-verstorben/", "osint_source_id": "e091af22-a2b0-4464-9a7d-0176123fd064", "published": "2024-05-22T07:32:01", "source": "https://www.borncity.com/blog/feed/", "story_id": "5c0b6981-f34c-44f3-b1f0-7fdf69cdb71b", "title": "C.

Other contributing factors include the tendency for drivers of electric cars to be younger and less experienced, and the vehicles' heavier weight and swift acceleration, increasing stopping distances. The Guardian reports: Data from 32 billion miles of battery-powered car travel and 3 trillion miles of petrol and diesel car trips showed that mile-for-mile electric and hybrid cars were twice as likely to hit pedestrians than fossil fuel-powered cars, and three times more likely to do so in urban areas. \"Electric cars are a hazard to pedestrians because they are less likely to be heard than petrol or diesel cars,\" said Phil Edwards, first author on the study and professor of epidemiology and statistics at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. \"The government needs to mitigate these risks if they are going to phase out the sale of petrol and diesel cars.\" \"If you're moving to an electric car, remember it's a new kind of vehicle,\" Edwards added. \"They are much quieter than the old-fashioned cars, and pedestrians have learned to navigate roads by listening for traffic. Drivers of these vehicles need to be extra cautious.\"\nMost vehicles on the road are petrol or diesel and these were involved in three-quarters of pedestrian collisions. But for the same distance travelled, battery-powered cars were more dangerous. The average annual pedestrian casualty rate per 100m miles travelled was 5.16 for electric and hybrid cars compared with 2.4 for petrol and diesel cars, according to the study in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. In rural settings, battery-powered cars were no more dangerous than petrol or diesel, but in towns and cities they were three times more likely to collide with pedestrians, the researchers found. Since July 2019, all new hybrid and electric vehicles sold in Europe have been required to have an acoustic vehicle alerting system that emits sound when the car is travelling slowly, but there are hundreds of thousands of electric cars on the road without the devices. \"If government made sure these systems were installed in all electric vehicles and retrofitted them to older electric cars, that would be a good start,\" Edwards said, adding that the Green Cross Code also \"probably needs updating.\"\nMost vehicles on the road are petrol or diesel and these were involved in three-quarters of pedestrian collisions.

It works alongside reverse proxies to permit, deny, or redirect requests.\nAuthelia connects directly to the reverse proxy but never to the application backends. Therefore, payloads sent by clients of the protected API never reach Authelia\u2014only the authentication components, such as the Authorization header, do. As a result, the protected APIs can be REST, GraphQL, or any other type of API over HTTP.\nAuthelia features\nJames Elliott, one of Authelia\u2019s developers, outlined several features that are completely different from most other solutions in this space:\nDeclarative configuration. This feature is probably the one most users find as a differentiator. Because the configuration is entirely done without a UI and is a configuration file, it makes it incredibly easy to work with when considering deployment methodologies like Ansible (and other configuration managers), Helm; and subsequently GitOps Workflows.\nVery low footprint. Authelia itself during normal operation uses between 20-25MB of RAM and often has a CPU utilization that is not visible with the exclusion of password hashing operations.\nThe development process for Authelia aims to forego implementations in instances where the security implications are questionable. We\u2019d rather say no to a feature than introduce a feature that makes it easy for a misunderstanding to lead to users causing a negative security outcome. This is reflected by our efforts to improve our practices to meet more of the OpenSSF Security Best Practices. We are currently satisfied with the passing score but aim to get Gold, or at the very least Silver.\nWe started as a direct integration with popular reverse proxies in a way that augmented the security of applications served by the reverse proxy.

Eine davon \u00e4hnelt jener von Filmstar Scarlett Johansson sehr - und zwar so sehr, dass selbst Freunde von Johansson dachten, sie h\u00e4tte der Entwicklerfirma OpenAI ihre Stimme geliehen.\nHat sie aber nicht, obwohl sie von OpenAI-CEO Sam Altman tats\u00e4chlich darum gebeten worden war. Nun ist sie verst\u00e4ndlicherweise sauer und macht ihrem \u00c4rger \u00f6ffentlich Luft.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Scarlett Johansson streitet mit OpenAI: KI-Stimme klingt wie ihre\nDer Fall zeigt ein Problem auf, das durch die voranschreitende Verbesserung von K\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz wohl noch \u00f6fters auftauchen wird. Die Programme sind ziemlich gut darin, menschliche Stimmen innerhalb k\u00fcrzester Zeit zu imitieren bzw. zu klonen. Das \u00f6ffnet die T\u00fcr f\u00fcr Missbrauch.\nScarlett Johansson wei\u00df, wovon sie spricht. Sie hat im vergangenen Jahr bereits eine KI-Firma verklagt, die in einer Werbung pr\u00e4sentiert hat, wie sie KI-generierte Bilder und die Stimme der Schauspielerin erzeugen kann. Doch wie leicht f\u00e4llt es KI, eine Stimme zu kopieren? Wie unverwechselbar ist unsere Stimme?\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Bankkonto l\u00e4sst sich mit k\u00fcnstlich generierter Stimme knacken\nKI kann quasi einen Fingerabdruck kopieren\nDie Stimme eines Menschen ist so einzigartig wie ein Fingerabdruck, hei\u00dft es oft. \"Das stimmt auch. Aber genau das ist die St\u00e4rke von KI, sie kann quasi einen Fingerabdruck kopieren\", sagt Malte Kob, Leiter des Instituts f\u00fcr Gesang und Stimmforschung der Universit\u00e4t f\u00fcr Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien.\nDer Charakter einer Stimme sei von vielen Eigenschaften abh\u00e4ngig. Besonders wichtig sei der so genannte Restklang, zu dem etwa die Formung von Zischlauten oder Konsonanten z\u00e4hlt. KI schaffe es, die Eigenschaften einer Stimme anhand von Beispielaufnahmen zu erkennen und zu reproduzieren.\nWenige Sekunden reichen\n\"Hinter solchen Spracherzeugungstechnologien, auch 'Voice Cloning' genannt, stecken Deep-Learning-Systeme, die daraus lernen, wie Audiospektren aufgebaut sind\", erkl\u00e4rt G\u00fcnter Klambauer vom Artificial Intelligence Lab des Linz Institute of Technology. Je mehr Sprachmaterial man von einer Person hat, desto besser k\u00f6nnten Stimmen imitiert werden: \"Die Eigenheiten einer Stimme kann man schon aus 30 Sekunden langen Aufnahmen herausziehen. Von Scarlett Johansson gibt es nat\u00fcrlich viel mehr.\"\nDass man Stimmen mit so wenig Trainingsmaterial nachbilden kann, sei j\u00fcngsten Fortschritten im Bereich des so genannten \"Few Shot Learning\" geschuldet. OpenAI hat erst Ende M\u00e4rz \"Voice Engine\" vorgestellt, ein KI-Programm, dem angeblich nur 15 Sekunden Sprachaufnahmen einer Person reichen, um ihre Stimme klonen zu k\u00f6nnen.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Sprach-KI von OpenAI imitiert die eigene Stimme\nWas nicht trainiert wurde, kann komisch klingen\nLaut Kob sei KI gut darin, eine Stimme gesamtheitlich zu erfassen. Es sei dennoch stark vom Trainingsmaterial abh\u00e4ngig, wie nat\u00fcrlich das Resultat klinge. Er schildert das in einem Beispiel: \"Ein Pferd soll einen Springparkour mit 20 Hindernissen bew\u00e4ltigen, es hat aber nur 19 trainiert. Das unbekannte Hindernis hat pl\u00f6tzlich einen Wassergraben. Da springt es entweder rein oder es verweigert, die H\u00fcrde zu nehmen.\"\nGenauso k\u00f6nne es beim \"Voice Cloning\" geschehen, dass die Trainingsdaten nur aus gesprochenem Material bestehen und pl\u00f6tzlich soll ein Lacher reproduziert werden. Das kann dann realistisch klingen, aber m\u00f6glicherweise auch ziemlich merkw\u00fcrdig.\nKritische Einstellung gegen\u00fcber Tonaufnahmen notwendig\nMit geklonten Stimmen wird jedenfalls bereits viel Schindluder getrieben. Telefonbetr\u00fcger*innen ahmen damit eigene Verwandte nach, Trolle hetzen Polizeieinheiten auf Unbescholtene (Swatting).\nDas Problem von \"Deep Fakes\" werde auch im Audiobereich immer gr\u00f6\u00dfer, sagt Medien- und Technikphilosoph Mark Coeckelbergh von der Universit\u00e4t Wien. \"Das reicht von Jugendlichen, die Bullying betreiben, bis hin zu Politiker*innen, die Wahlen manipulieren, indem sie Skandale rund um Konkurrent*innen kreieren.\"\nZu schriftlichen Texten h\u00e4tten viele Menschen bereits eine kritische Einstellung entwickelt, Stichwort Fake News. \"So eine kritische Einstellung muss man immer mehr auch gegen\u00fcber Ton- und Bildaufnahmen einnehmen.\" Ein gro\u00dfes ethisches Problem sei auch, dass man mit KI-Stimmen in Konkurrenz zu Menschen tritt, die bisher als professionelle Sprecher*innen gearbeitet haben. Ihnen drohe ein Jobverlust, wenn Unternehmen auf die Idee kommen, mittels KI g\u00fcnstiger Texte vertonen zu k\u00f6nnen.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Warum wir Deepfakes f\u00fcr echt halten, egal wie schlecht sie sind\nKI zu entlarven, wird immer schwierig sein\nFeststellen zu k\u00f6nnen, ob eine Stimme tats\u00e4chlich von einer Person stammt oder von einer KI erzeugt wurde, sei schwierig, meint Klambauer. Aber genauso, wie Menschen bestimmte Charakteristika bei ihrer Handschrift oder dem Tippen auf einem Keyboard aufweisen, habe KI-Software bestimmte Muster beim Erzeugen von Sprache.\n\"Ein anderes KI-System k\u00f6nnte erkennen, ob Voice Cloning stattgefunden hat.\" Wie bei KI im Allgemeinen gebe es aber ein st\u00e4ndiges Katz-und-Maus-Spiel, sagt Coeckelbergh. \"Es wird immer Technologien geben, die Detektionsma\u00dfnahmen umgehen k\u00f6nnen.\"\nFrag die futurezone\nIn der Rubrik \"Frag die futurezone\" recherchieren und beantworten wir ausgew\u00e4hlte Fragen zu Tech-Themen f\u00fcr euch.\nStellen k\u00f6nnt ihr sie mit einer E-Mail an die Adresse redaktion@futurezone.at - Betreff: \"Frag die futurezone\", ihr k\u00f6nnt uns aber auch gern via Social Media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) kontaktieren.\nKommentare", "hash": "10b9cc2ce5743ae1db10de8aca6df58aefc630be8c1ae95de343e63faf8c9a7d", "id": "34b563e6-0f29-4c51-b8c9-43f2a5b089be", "link": "https://futurezone.at/digital-life/kuenstliche-intelligenz-stimme-einzigartig-imitieren-klonen-voice-cloning-scarlett-johansson-openai/402903019", "osint_source_id": "eec2ad26-2f4c-4dd8-a3e5-08c0eb3765ca", "published": "2024-05-22T04:00:00", "source": "https://futurezone.at/xml/rss", "story_id": "55fc0f72-1542-459c-afd1-4e7a301bf24f", "title": "Wie leicht kann KI meine Stimme imitieren?"}], "tags": {"Coeckelbergh": {"name": "Coeckelbergh", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Fake News": {"name": "Fake News", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "G\u00fcnter Klambauer": {"name": "G\u00fcnter Klambauer", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Instagram": {"name": "Instagram", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Johansson": {"name": "Johansson", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Klambauer": {"name": "Klambauer", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Kob": {"name": "Kob", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Malte Kob": {"name": "Malte Kob", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Mark Coeckelbergh": {"name": "Mark Coeckelbergh", "tag_type": "PER"}, "OpenAI": {"name": "OpenAI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Sam Altman": {"name": "Sam Altman", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Scarlett Johansson": {"name": "Scarlett Johansson", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Twitter": {"name": "Twitter", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "Wie leicht kann KI meine Stimme imitieren?"}, {"attributes": [], "created": "2024-05-22T04:00:00", "id": "d9c202cb-3ce8-4cf7-8c2b-409627fbc878", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Schon l\u00e4nger sehen sich zahlreiche Volkswirtschaften mit einem akuten Arbeitskr\u00e4ftemangel konfrontiert.

However, 61% of respondents say they are pushing their organization to adopt generative AI more quickly than some people are comfortable with.\nThe findings also revealed that 63% of surveyed CEOs say their teams have the skills and knowledge to incorporate generative AI, but few understand how generative AI adoption impacts their organization\u2019s workforce and culture.\n56% of respondents have not yet assessed the impact of generative AI on their employees. Yet, 51% of CEOs surveyed say they are hiring for generative AI roles that did not exist last year, while 47% expect to reduce or redeploy their workforce in the next 12 months because of generative AI.\n\u201cThere is incredible excitement around generative AI, and CEOs want to move beyond the AI hype to deliver business impact. Yet, without the right people and culture in place, progress will be slow,\u201d said Matt Candy, Global Managing Partner, IBM Consulting. \u201cAs they embed generative AI in their enterprise strategy, it\u2019s critical that executives build a cultural mindset that fosters adoption and lead people through the changes.\u201d\nCEOs plan to hire additional staff because of generative AI\n40% of CEOs surveyed plan to hire additional staff because of generative AI, yet 53% of respondents say they are already struggling to fill key technology roles.

At the same time, 37% acknowledge that their employees don\u2019t fully understand how strategic decisions impact them.\n57% of those surveyed acknowledge that cultural change is more important to becoming a data-driven organization than overcoming technical challenges. CEOs cite generative AI adoption as being critical to success, but 64% say their organization must take advantage of technologies that are changing faster than people can adapt.\nTrustworthy AI requires effective governance\n68% agree that governance for generative AI must be established as solutions are designed, rather than after they are deployed. Although 75% of CEOs say trusted AI is impossible without effective AI governance in their organization, only 39% say they have good generative AI governance in place today.\nAt the same time, 62% of CEO say they will take more risk than the competition to maintain competitive edge, with 51% agreeing that the risk of falling behind is driving them to invest in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value. 67% say the productivity gains from automation are so great that they must accept significant risk to stay competitive.\nWhile today 71% of surveyed CEOs are no further than generative AI piloting and experimentation, 49% expect to be driving growth and expansion by 2026.\nCEOs ranked product and service innovation as their highest priority for the next three years \u2013 up from sixth place in 2023. 41% say they are willing to sacrifice operational efficiency for greater innovation.\nHowever, a majority of CEOs surveyed point to a focus on short-term performance as their top barrier to innovation.

And with good reason: failing to bounce back quickly from a security event can have dramatic financial consequences. In early 2023, Royal Mail took several days to recover from a Lockbit cyberattack, losing upwards of \u00a310 million in the process. However, for all the talk about resilience, the industry seems to be overlooking one of its fundamental tenets: risk management.\nIt is, perhaps, understandable that we overlook risk management. Striking the right balance can be difficult, with risk managers often either needing to be more optimistic about their organization's risk profile or drifting into wild flights of fancy, dreaming up fantastic, improbable hypothetical scenarios.\nHowever, risk management is crucial to achieving cyber resilience and must be addressed. But how can you walk the line between over-optimism and over-precaution? By using a solid assurance framework. HITRUST offers one such framework.\nWhat is HITRUST?\nWhile officially titled the Health Information Trust Alliance, HITRUST's assurance approach is not specific to healthcare or limited to it. It is an industry-agnostic approach that all industries can employ to address compliance and risk management. But HITRUST is one of many risk management frameworks, so why choose it?\nHITRUST engages an organization's risk profile uniquely. Building upon the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and NIST's PRISMA, the HITRUST approach leverages best-in-class components for a comprehensive information risk management and compliance program that integrates and aligns the following:\nHITRUST CSF is a robust privacy and security controls framework that harmonizes dozens of authoritative sources, such as HIPAA, ISO 27001, and NIST 800-171.\n-\nHITRUST Assurance Program is a scalable and transparent means to provide reliable assurances to internal and external stakeholders.\n-\nHITRUST MyCSF is a HITRUST CSF compliance operations and audit management platform used by organizations adopting the HITRUST CSF, their external assessors, and HITRUST.\n-\nHITRUST Shared Responsibility Program is a suite of matrices and inheritance workflows clarifying service provider and customer responsibilities and enabling the sharing of assessment results between service providers and their customers.\n-\nHITRUST Assessment XChange is a third-party risk management solution.\n-\nHITRUST Third Party Assurance Program is a third-party risk management process.\n-\nHITRUST and Continuous Monitoring\nIn recent years, many compliance gap assessments have employed a \"point-in-time\" evaluation to determine whether an organization has achieved a particular benchmark of control implementation and operation. The assessor then periodically reviewed and re-performed assessment activities (e.g., annually). However, this method forced assessors and certification bodies to make predictions based on current-state assessment results. These predictions weren't always accurate.\nHowever, HITRUST has worked to incorporate concepts of Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) into their assurance program's methodology and offerings. This has primarily made the \"point-in-time\" nature of traditional security assessments a thing of the past. HITRUST now employs a continuous, prospective monitoring model, providing assessed entities, HITRUST assessors, and HITRUST itself a real-time view into an organization's control status, helping to make ongoing, risk-based decisions. The result? A significantly improved security posture.\nThe only thing worse than discovering gaps in a security program is finding controls that have gone neglected to the point that an old gap is re-opened. An ISCM approach prevents this by creating less degradation over time than the traditional periodic review. Other tangible benefits include:\nLonger periods between comprehensive control gap assessments.\n-\nReduced time and effort needed to maintain certification.\n-\nReduced lifecycle costs for maintaining certification.\n-\nHigher assurance and trust with and amongst external stakeholders such as regulators, business partners, and customers.\n-\nCertification is essential, as it objectively verifies that a security program operates within the parameters of its intended design; this has implications beyond the comfort of a successful audit cycle. Through ISCM, the HITRUST CSF Assurance Program will allow the findings in the CSF Assessment Report to be truly prospective.\nMany security initiatives are viewed as \"cost centers,\" not adding value to an organization. From a monetary perspective, a HITRUST certification adds value by not only helping a company meet cybersecurity insurability standards but also lowering those insurance premiums; this is because the HITRUST standard holds high confidence in the industry. This is also recognized by entities such as the US Government Accountability Office (GAO), which is tasked with saving taxpayer money.\nAchieving HITRUST Compliance\nNow that we better understand what HITRUST is and why it's essential, we can look at how to achieve compliance. Here's a step-by-step guide:\nAssess and define scope \u2013 Evaluate your current security measures, risk management process, and data protection practices, then determine which of your systems, processes, and personnel you will include in your compliance efforts.\n-\nUnderstand the requirements \u2013 Read and understand the HITRUST CSF and the specific security requirements and controls relevant to your organization.\n-\nComplete a readiness assessment - Use a questionnaire to detail your organization's size, risk exposure, and other relevant factors. This data will help you identify the necessary controls, requirements, and the levels you need to implement them.\n-\nDevelop policies and procedures - Create and document policies and procedures based on HITRUST requirements and tailored to your organization. You must define how to address risk management, control requirements, data protection, and other critical aspects of a security program.\n-\nEmploy security controls\u2014Ensure the security controls outlined in the HITRUST CSF are set up in your environment and integrated with your daily operations.\n-\nImplement data protection measures \u2013 Deploy data protection measures aligned with HITRUST standards. These measures include encryption, access controls, and secure transmission protocols.\n-\nValidate and assess - Employ a third-party auditor licensed by the HITRUST Alliance to ensure you comply. Auditors will scrutinize the data from your self-assessment and thoroughly examine your security processes and controls. Once assessed, you will present the results to HITRUST to be examined.\n-\nAchieve certification \u2013 If you have met the requirements, HITRUST will issue the certification; if not, HITRUST will issue a letter explaining why you don't comply and how to correct your mistakes.\n-\nStay informed and train your staff - Ensure staff understand HITRUST and their roles in maintaining compliance. Stay in the loop about updates to the HITRUST framework and make changes when necessary.\n-\nDeploy continuous monitoring\u2014Implement a continuous monitoring mechanism for your security controls and regularly assess and review your security posture to ensure compliance with HITRUST.\n-\nTo sum up, it's important to remember that achieving HITRUST compliance is not a set-it-and-forget-it task. HITRUST is one of the highest data protection standards in the world, and compliance is no mean feat. Compliance can offer you a competitive advantage, greatly reduce the risk of a security incident, and significantly bolster cyber resilience\u2014but you must work for it.\nTripwire Enterprise: Security Configuration Management (SCM) Software\nEnhance your organization's cybersecurity with Tripwire Enterprise!

The major trends to look out for seem to focus mainly on AI. While the rise of generative AI indeed poses challenges, executives should be cautious not to miss other critical trends that will shape the cybersecurity landscape this year.\nAI-driven Social Engineering\nSince the advent of commercial Large Language Models (LLM), many have criticized the numerous possibilities they offer to malicious cyber actors. That's not all, though. AI also enables cybercriminals to obtain large amounts of data to launch phishing attacks. The rise of deep fakes, which trick unaware users by impersonating trusted sources, is also a real threat.\nCurrently, there seems to be no definite technological answer to end deepfakes. Instead, most advice focuses on maintaining good cybersecurity practices. AI algorithms are so sophisticated that they evade detection, which makes things much more complicated.\nAI is changing the social engineering industry, but if 2023 was a year of taking account of this new threat and catching up with the creativity of threat actors, 2024 looks to create greater problems with more severe consequences.\nCybersecurity AI\nGenerative AI put a new spin on artificial intelligence and caught everyone by surprise late in 2022. Even before then, threat actors had begun deploying AI to launch new types of attacks. However, the realization is fully dawning that the way to combat these AI-driven attacks is also through AI \u2013 Cybersecurity AI. The rapid evolution of LLMs in 2023 caught many executives by surprise, as there was no concrete plan to counteract the negative consequences.\nRegardless, in 2024, organizations have no excuse for not prioritizing cybersecurity AI, including for attack surface management. Particularly, one area of concern is the increasing use of commercial AI tools by employees. To avoid data leakage and exfiltration, policies regarding acceptable use must be created.\nNational US Data Privacy Regulation\nCorporations have been complaining about the complicated patchwork of privacy laws under which the United States operates. Various sectors, such as healthcare and financial services, are governed by specific laws. Privacy laws, particularly in the interest of protecting underage users, are also on the rise.\nHowever, the major challenge remains the lack of a federal data privacy regulation that applies in every state. As things stand, trying to adhere to data privacy regulations from all the different states is exhausting for a corporation.\nThis is completely different from the European Union, where 27 countries are governed by a single data privacy law. So far, the largest attempt towards this goal is the American Data Privacy and Protection Act, and despite gaining bipartisan support, it was never implemented.\nMore state laws \u2013 notably in Florida, Texas, and Montana \u2013 are coming into effect soon. However, the call for a federal regulation persists. Considering the increasing threat posed by AI, this year may finally be a landmark year for the US\u2019s national data privacy law.\nRansomware\nIn the past few years, the corporate world has battled fiercely with ransomware, a particularly lucrative form of cyber attack. While many thought that the \u201cgood guys\u201d were finally winning the war, it turned out that, according to the 2024 Ransomware Threat Landscape report, ransomware attacks spiked towards the end of 2023.\nThough the policy declaration is not legally binding, there was a glimmer of hope in November as 50 members of the International Counter Ransomware Initiative pledged not to pay ransomware extortion demands.\nState-sponsored Cyber Attacks\nWe were barely two weeks into January when Microsoft detected a Russian state-sponsored attack against its systems. This illustrates another trend that has persisted over the past few years and emphasizes the need to urgently tackle attacks of this nature. State-sponsored attacks are far more dangerous than other attacks because they threaten national security, compromise critical infrastructure, and escalate geopolitical tensions through espionage and other sinister activities.\nMajor international crises, including the Russian-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine conflict, persist in 2024, with no bright signs of any positive change. Large corporations and governments need more concerted efforts to repel these attacks.\nPasswords and Passkeys\nAuthentication has been a major challenge in cybersecurity, and over the years, passwords, despite posing a convenience challenge, have solidified their role as the most secure authentication standard. However, the corporate world may finally be fully ready for a more secure, passwordless approach to security. Through passkey sign-on technology tied to biometrics or hardware keys, users no longer need to remember several passwords while resting assured of a high level of security.\nEven though there is still a long way to go before passkey sign-on is fully normalized, its adoption by Google, Apple, Microsoft, X, Amazon, and various password management tools means that enormous strides will be recorded \u2013 and are, in fact, already being recorded \u2013 in 2024 as passkeys increasingly become the global login standard. However, passwords will not completely disappear any time soon. So, security on that front shouldn't be jettisoned.\nMobile Security\nCyber attacks on mobile devices have become more frequent as these gadgets have become work tools. Google's announcement at the end of last year that Android 14 will enable passkeys was a significant development in mobile security. Yet, there's still a lot to be done. For instance, according to Kaspersky, adware is still a major challenge, making up over half of mobile device risks. Of course, phishing remains a challenge, too. These challenges cut across platforms.\nAccording to Zimperium's mobile security report for 2023, 80% of zero-day mobile exploits targeted iOS devices, while critical Android vulnerabilities detected witnessed a 138% year-over-year increase. Mobile operating system makers continue their commitment to greater security in 2024, and this is an area to keep an eye on.\nConclusion\nCybersecurity challenges are never-ending. However, by staying ahead of the curve, organizations can ensure they are not playing catch-up in a game where threat actors are making massive strides. By addressing these trends, businesses can guarantee that they are staying on top of the cybersecurity situation.\nEditor\u2019s Note: The opinions expressed in this guest author article are solely those of the contributor and do not necessarily reflect those of Tripwire.", "hash": "ad708511ed6886c1c3cf785c234a6b153b19748f53af3ad6b10200fbe734b0d7", "id": "5476873f-51d2-4c82-b1cb-276dd5de7d68", "link": "https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/top-cybersecurity-trends-enterprises", "osint_source_id": "49eba848-e760-4f73-b81f-f55385beab89", "published": "2024-05-22T03:20:41", "source": "https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/feed/", "story_id": "8cd282a5-6b63-474b-88dc-1d8e403423be", "title": "Top 7 Cybersecurity Trends for Enterprises in 2024"}], "tags": {"AI-driven": {"name": "AI-driven", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Android 14": {"name": "Android 14", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Florida": {"name": "Florida", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Google": {"name": "Google", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Israel": {"name": "Israel", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Israel-Palestine": {"name": "Israel-Palestine", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Kaspersky": {"name": "Kaspersky", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "LLMs": {"name": "LLMs", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Montana": {"name": "Montana", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Patchwork": {"name": "Patchwork", "tag_type": "APT"}, "Russian": {"name": "Russian", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Russian-Ukraine": {"name": "Russian-Ukraine", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "State-sponsored": {"name": "State-sponsored", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Texas": {"name": "Texas", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Ukraine": {"name": "Ukraine", "tag_type": "Country"}, "United States": {"name": "United States", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Zimperium": {"name": "Zimperium", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "phishing": {"name": "phishing", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "zero-day": {"name": "zero-day", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Top 7 Cybersecurity Trends for Enterprises in 2024"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-22T09:24:33.153953", "id": "575f4aab-6ee7-4112-906b-bdb527af10d2", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "5"}, {"created": "2024-05-22T09:10:49.363740", "id": "af565a6f-a548-4d62-97e0-fafbc31478aa", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "0"}], "created": "2024-05-22T03:00:50", "id": "83af067c-716d-4b3c-839e-ca5665e0b4f3", "news_items": [{"author": "Help Net Security", "content": "Technological complexity drives new wave of identity risks\nSecurity leaders are facing increased technological and organizational complexity, which is creating a new wave of identity risks for their organizations, according to ConductorOne.\nBased on a survey of 523 US-based IT security leaders at companies with 250 to 10,000 employees, the study explores the top challenges and opportunities of identity security, access management, and zero standing privilege.\nIdentity issues pose growing risk to organizations\nAccording to the survey findings, most organizations have experienced firsthand just how risky identity issues have become. 77% of respondents said their organization has suffered from instances of cyberattacks or data breaches in the past 12 months due to improper access or overprivileged users. Furthermore, 41% of respondents said there had been multiple instances of cyberattacks or data breaches due to the same improper access issues.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now squarely in a new world order in which identity and access must be viewed and managed as a high-priority security risk, not just an IT issue,\u201d said Alex Bovee, CEO of ConductorOne. \u201cAs our survey shows, the complexity of modern technology environments has made identity an overwhelming challenge for security teams \u2014 and a prime target for attack. Fortunately, many organizations are leaning into automation and zero standing privilege to reduce complexity, minimize risk, and bring identity chaos to order.\u201d\nThe interconnectedness of modern technology environments has opened the door to a wide range of new identity and access risks. Key survey findings related to technology complexity include:\nHybrid IT: 76% of survey respondents indicated their company has a hybrid environment. Just 6% of respondents said their environment is completely in the cloud, and only 18% stated their environment is completely on premises.\nExtended enterprise: 97% of surveyed security leaders reported that their company works with external entities like contractors, partners, or suppliers who have access to their various systems, applications, and/or resources.\nNon-human identities: 81% of respondents stated they are concerned about non-human identities and the risk they pose to their company.\nSaaS sprawl: Security leaders estimated that an average of 39.5 SaaS apps are in use across their company. Smaller companies reported an average of 9.2 SaaS apps in use, whereas larger companies reported an average of 70.4 apps.\nTop identity and access management challenges\nWhen asked to describe their top identity and access management challenges, 47% of respondents cited the complexity of existing systems, followed by employees\u2019 resistance to change (38%), limitations due to available tools (33%), and executives\u2019 resistance to change (32%).\n47% of survey respondents said their company\u2019s identity security strategy and access policies hinder team productivity, with 23% citing a significant hindrance on productivity.\n84% reported either a moderate or significant increase in their company\u2019s budget allocation for identity and access-related products this year. 95% said their budget allocations for identity and access-related products are adequate.\nDespite increasing budgets and respondents self-reporting that their allocations are adequate, 73% of respondents still find themselves frequently or very frequently negotiating higher security budgets due to increasing security risks and responsibilities.\nSecurity leaders believe ZSP is effective at reducing access risks\nThe concept zero standing privilege (ZSP) requires that a user only be granted the minimum levels of access and privilege needed to complete a task, and only for a limited amount of time. Should an attacker gain entry to a user\u2019s account, ZSP ensures there is far less potential for attackers to access sensitive data and systems.\nThe study found that 93% of security leaders believe ZSP is effective at reducing access risks within their organization. Additionally, 91% reported that ZSP is being enforced across at least some of their company\u2019s systems.\nAs security leaders face greater complexity across their organizations\u2019 systems and escalating attacks from adversaries, it\u2019s no surprise that risk reduction was cited as respondents\u2019 top priority for identity and access management (55%). This was followed by improving team productivity (50%) and automating processes (47%).\nInterestingly, improving user experience was cited as the top priority among respondents who experienced multiple instances of attacks or breaches due to improper access in the last year.\nThis group also identified their top identity challenges to be executive and employee resistance to change, which may indicate that greater organizational friction could lead to an increased risk factor.", "hash": "b3f53546d0cbd02b8b30072286fda1c2dfb1ffbbddc3ce281aeb57837666ca60", "id": "1279be6b-353d-4080-acac-23a765b3ea15", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/05/22/identity-risks-complexity-for-organizations/", "osint_source_id": "c5bebd4b-5715-4589-a65c-0344a226ab6f", "published": "2024-05-22T03:00:50", "source": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/feed", "story_id": "83af067c-716d-4b3c-839e-ca5665e0b4f3", "title": "Technological complexity drives new wave of identity risks"}], "tags": {"Alex Bovee": {"name": "Alex Bovee", "tag_type": "PER"}, "ConductorOne": {"name": "ConductorOne", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "US-based": {"name": "US-based", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ZSP": {"name": "ZSP", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "Technological complexity drives new wave of identity risks"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-22T09:23:05.631220", "id": "a817ad50-8ce1-44ee-8f5f-f077659d2f8b", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "14"}], "created": "2024-05-22T02:02:00", "id": "9af915de-80a8-4166-b6b3-7950f8a9687c", "news_items": [{"author": "BeauHD", "content": "DOJ Makes Its First Known Arrest For AI-Generated CSAM (engadget.com) 53\nIn what's believed to be the first case of its kind, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested a Wisconsin man last week for generating and distributing AI-generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even if no children were used to create the material, the DOJ \"looks to establish a judicial precedent that exploitative materials are still illegal,\" reports Engadget. From the report: The DOJ says 42-year-old software engineer Steven Anderegg of Holmen, WI, used a fork of the open-source AI image generator Stable Diffusion to make the images, which he then used to try to lure an underage boy into sexual situations. The latter will likely play a central role in the eventual trial for the four counts of \"producing, distributing, and possessing obscene visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct and transferring obscene material to a minor under the age of 16.\" The government says Anderegg's images showed \"nude or partially clothed minors lasciviously displaying or touching their genitals or engaging in sexual intercourse with men.\" The DOJ claims he used specific prompts, including negative prompts (extra guidance for the AI model, telling it what not to produce) to spur the generator into making the CSAM.\nCloud-based image generators like Midjourney and DALL-E 3 have safeguards against this type of activity, but Ars Technica reports that Anderegg allegedly used Stable Diffusion 1.5, a variant with fewer boundaries. Stability AI told the publication that fork was produced by Runway ML. According to the DOJ, Anderegg communicated online with the 15-year-old boy, describing how he used the AI model to create the images. The agency says the accused sent the teen direct messages on Instagram, including several AI images of \"minors lasciviously displaying their genitals.\" To its credit, Instagram reported the images to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which alerted law enforcement. Anderegg could face five to 70 years in prison if convicted on all four counts.

Many industrial processes rely on fossil fuels to reach high temps right now, but researchers at ETH Zurich have found a new way to crank up the heat with a solar thermal trap. [via SciTechDaily]\nHeating water for showers or radiant floor systems in homes is old hat now, but industrial application of solar power has been few and far between. Part of the issue has been achieving high enough temperatures. Opaque absorbers can only ever get as hot as the incident surface where the sun hits them, but some translucent materials, like quartz can form thermal traps.\nIn a thermal trap, \u201cit is possible to achieve temperatures that are higher in the bulk of the material than at the surface exposed to solar radiation.\u201d In the study, the researchers were able to get a 450\u02daC surface to produce 1,050\u02daC interior temperature in the 300 mm long quartz rod. The system does rely on concentrated solar power, 135 suns-worth for this study, but mirror and lens systems for solar concentration already exist due to the aforementioned electrical power generation.\nThis isn\u2019t the only time we\u2019ve seen someone smelting on sunlight alone, and you can always do it less directly by using a hydrogen intermediary. If you\u2019re wanting a more domestic-level of heat, why not try the wind if the sun doesn\u2019t shine much in your neighborhood?\nOne thought on \u201cIndustrial Solar Heat Hits 1000\u02daC\u201d\nOne of the problems with concentrated solar power is the inconsistent heat input, and what that does to the generator system. Plants like the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility under-performed badly because it takes time to heat up the collectors and fluids.\nUnlike photovoltaics that generate whenever the sun is visible, a CSP system on an industrial scale is so slow that it more or less sees the average amount of sunlight over several hours, so a partially cloudy day is like putting a dimmer switch on the sun. It just can\u2019t react fast enough, so the temperature remains low, so the turbine efficiency becomes low, or it doesn\u2019t even start. The Ivanpah facility ended up making half as much power as projected by the amount of sunlight they were getting, and burning tons of natural gas just to keep the boilers hot.\nThe same problems arise in trying to get industrial heat out of solar collectors: on most days you don\u2019t have enough un-interrupted sunshine to get the collector up to the desired temperature, for long enough to actually use it, so you either have to deal with lower operating temperatures or have no use of it at all.\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

At its simplest incarnation, you need reliable inputs that provide estimates as to how long each route to a location will take and then you need to know how to apply the rest of the constraints like driver availability, time taken at each location, opening hours, working hours, demand, capacity and more. In the solution we will review here, Azure Maps provides the input and NVIDIA cuOpt will apply the constraints for optimization.\n \nThe Flexibility of Azure Maps\nAzure Maps offers, besides mapping, also an advanced routing engine, tailored for both cars and commercial trucks, complete with a Route Matrix API and traffic and accident APIs what are part of the routing engine as well. Learn here more about what Azure Maps can do for you.\n \nThe Power of NVIDIA cuOpt\nEnter NVIDIA cuOpt, a state-of-the-art,\u00a0GPU-accelerated\u00a0engine designed for tackling complex routing challenges. It leverages parallel heuristics to accelerate solutions to VRP, PDP, and other related optimization problems. NVIDIA cuOpt is versatile, accommodating various constraints such as vehicle capacities, delivery time windows, and even the intricacies of drivers\u2019 shifts and breaks.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nSolving TSP with Azure Maps and NVIDIA cuOpt\nImagine you\u2019re tasked with coordinating package deliveries from multiple depots, utilizing a fleet of vehicles with varying capacities, to a diverse set of customers with unique requirements. Azure Maps and NVIDIA cuOpt emerge as your allies in this complex scenario.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nPreparation: Gathering Essential Data\nBefore you begin with route optimization, you\u2019ll need to collect some fundamental data:\n\nDepot Locations:\u00a0Where your journey begins.\nCustomer Drop-off Locations:\u00a0Including details like opening hours and dwell time.\nVehicle Specifications:\u00a0Capacity, starting, and ending locations.\nDriver Details:\u00a0Working hours, breaks, vehicle assignments, and costs.\n\n\u00a0\nStep One: Constructing a Cost and Travel Time Matrix\nUsing\u00a0Azure Maps Matrix APIs, you can calculate a comprehensive matrix that outlines the \u2018cost\u2019 in meters and travel time in seconds between every depot and drop-off location. For instance, with two depots and eight drop-off points, you\u2019d create a 10x10 matrix. Each location serves as both an origin and a destination, resulting in a matrix where the distance and time to the same location are zero\u2014since they are, naturally, identical.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nmatrix\nDepot 1\nDepot 2\nStop 1\nStop 2\nStop 3\n\u2026\n\n\n\n\nDepot 1\n0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nDepot 2\n\u00a0\n0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nStop 1\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nStop 2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nStop 3\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2026\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWe have developed a\u00a0Multi-Itinerary Optimization Sample\u00a0to get you started quickly, the core of this sample is this function:\n\n\n\u00a0\n// Itinerary Optimization function\nasync function itineraryOptimizationClicked() {\n\n    // Show loading icon\n    showLoadingIcon(true);\n\n    // Clear the route data source\n    routeDataSource.clear();\n\n    // We need all coordinates together depots + stops\n    const allCoordinates = [...depots, ...stops];\n\n    // Get the Azure Maps Matrix results for all coordinates\n    const matrix = await getMatrixAsync(allCoordinates);\n\n    // We use the NVIDIA cuOpt optimizer service to calculate the Multi-Itinerary Optimization\n    const solver = await getOptimizedRouteAsync(matrix);\n\n    // Render the route on the map for each vehicle using Azure Maps Route API\n    renderRoutes(allCoordinates, solver);\n\n    // Hide loading icon\n    showLoadingIcon(false);\n}\n\u00a0\nThe complete Multi-Itinerary Optimization Sample\u00a0source code\u00a0can be found on the\u00a0Azure Maps Code Samples GitHub\u00a0page.\n\n\n\u00a0\nStep Two: Determining the Optimal Delivery Sequence\nWith the matrix data in hand, it\u2019s time to decide the delivery sequence. This is where\u00a0NVIDIA cuOpt\u00a0shines, optimizing the order of delivery for each vehicle based on capacity, demand, and operational hours\u2014without needing any sensitive location or customer data, thus addressing privacy concerns.\n\u00a0\n\nSee our\u00a0how-to guide\u00a0how to set up and create a solution with NVIDIA cuOpt and Azure Maps.\n\n\u00a0\nStep Three: Real-World Route Mapping\nOnce NVIDIA cuOpt has determined the optimal delivery order, the final step is to map the actual routes using Azure Maps Routing APIs. This process translates the optimized sequence into actionable routes for each vehicle.\nIn a hypothetical scenario with four vehicles serving two depots and eight drop-off locations, the outcome might look like this:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\nDepot 1: Vehicle A -> Stop 1 -> Stop 3 -> Stop 5 -> Depot 1\nDepot 1: Vehicle B -> Stop 2 -> Stop 4 -> Stop 6 -> Depot 1\nDepot 2: Vehicle C -> Stop 7 -> Stop 8 -> Depot 2\nDepot 2: Vehicle D -> Stop 9 -> Stop 10 -> Depot 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nAre you ready to deliver?\u00a0Get started with the Azure Maps and NVIDIA cuOpt to optimize your delivery needs.

The European Union's AI Act is more comprehensive than the United States' light-touch voluntary compliance approach while China's approach aims to maintain social stability and state control.

It restricts governments' use of real-time biometric surveillance in public spaces to cases of certain crimes, prevention of terrorist attacks and searches for people suspected of the most serious crimes. The new legislation will have an impact beyond the 27-country bloc, said Patrick van Eecke at law firm Cooley. \"The Act will have global reach. Companies outside the EU who use EU customer data in their AI platforms will need to comply. Other countries and regions are likely to use the AI Act as a blueprint, just as they did with the GDPR,\" he said, referring to EU privacy rules.\nWhile the new legislation will apply in 2026, bans on the use of artificial intelligence in social scoring, predictive policing and untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage will kick in in six months once the new regulation enters into force. Obligations for general purpose AI models will apply after 12 months and rules for AI systems embedded into regulated products in 36 months. Fines for violations range from $8.2 million or 1.5% of turnover to 35 million euros or 7% of global turnover depending on the type of violations.\nThe AI Act imposes strict transparency obligations on high-risk AI systems while such requirements for general-purpose AI models will be lighter.

The agency basically wants techies to get together and build a suite of software tools that can scan for vulnerabilities and weaknesses in hospital computer systems, and then automatically deploy patches for identified threats, developing and testing fixes and mitigations as needed.\nAs such, the agency this week invited teams to apply for funding totaling tens of millions of dollars to create UPGRADE and see it through to completion.\nModern medical facilities typically use a lot of internet or network-connected devices, and taking these offline to patch or protect them can disrupt patient services. Not patching them, however, leaves clinics vulnerable to compromise. To accommodate these hospital-specific concerns, the UPGRADE platform will test software fixes in a model environment before deploying them \"with minimum interruption\" to the devices that need them, if the plans come to fruition.\nThe project thus seeks participants focused on four specific areas: Creating a vulnerability mitigation software platform; developing digital twins of hospital equipment; auto-detecting flaws; and auto-developing custom defenses.\nARPA-H is a US government funding agency that President Joe Biden created two years ago. It's tasked with making \"pivotal investments in breakthrough technologies\" that advantage medicine and healthcare \u2014 specifically technologies that \"cannot readily be accomplished through traditional research or commercial activity.\" And its director reports to the US Dept of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary.\n\"We continue to see how interconnected our nation's health care ecosystem is and how critical it is for our patients and clinical operations to be protected from cyberattacks,\" HHS Deputy Secretary Andrea Palm said in a statement. \"ARPA-H's UPGRADE will help build on HHS' Healthcare Sector Cybersecurity Strategy to ensure that all hospital systems, large and small, are able to operate more securely and adapt to the evolving landscape.\"\nHHS, incidentally, sets hospitals voluntary healthcare-specific cybersecurity performance goals that look likely to become mandatory.\nRansomware can mean life or death at hospitals. DEF CON hackers to the rescue?\n-\nIgnore Uncle Sam's 'voluntary' cybersecurity goals for hospitals at your peril\n-\nUncle Sam urges action after Black Basta ransomware infects Ascension\n-\nUnitedHealth's 'egregious negligence' led to Change Healthcare ransomware infection\n-\nUPGRADE, and what it hopes to accomplish, is a big task. It's also potentially a life-saving one, as ransomware and other criminal gangs increasingly target medical facilities with the intent of locking IT and medical staff out of critical systems needed to deploy ambulances, provide medications and services, and access patients' vital information.\n\"Healthcare is both acutely being targeted, and it has been more and more targeted over the last few years,\" ARPA-H program manager Andrew Carney told The Register in an earlier interview. \"It's also uniquely sensitive to disruptions compared to many other critical infrastructure sectors.\"\nCarney, at the time, was discussing another recent ARPA-H partnership, this one with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for the Artificial Intelligence Cyber Challenge (AIxCC).\nAIxCC is the two-year competition that DARPA announced last summer at the annual Black Hat conference in Las Vegas. It focuses on building AI-based tools that automatically secure code used in critical infrastructure. Participants in this challenge are now competing in trials to see which teams will advance to the semifinals at DEF CON in August.\nDuring the semi-finals, seven teams will each be awarded $2 million before advancing to the final competition at the DEF CON conference in 2025. \u00ae", "hash": "aa1c2e33d12e690a41f86a56299b5244999a032f0ea02870703075d3b5913e56", "id": "039bdc37-e58b-4c36-976e-790be22ec2dd", "link": "https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2024/05/22/50m_investment_hospital_security/", "osint_source_id": "a94d3f15-5689-470c-9d1f-670b8c63491d", "published": "2024-05-22T00:46:12", "source": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/headlines.atom", "story_id": "c4eefd67-5e92-4cc0-893c-3de069d36d69", "title": "Uncle Sam to inject $50M into auto-patcher for hospital IT"}], "tags": {"AI-based": {"name": "AI-based", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "AIxCC": {"name": "AIxCC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "ARPA-H": {"name": "ARPA-H", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Andrea Palm": {"name": "Andrea Palm", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Andrew Carney": {"name": "Andrew Carney", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Carney": {"name": "Carney", "tag_type": "PER"}, "DARPA": {"name": "DARPA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency": {"name": "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "HHS": {"name": "HHS", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Joe Biden": {"name": "Joe Biden", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Las Vegas": {"name": "Las Vegas", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Sam": {"name": "Sam", "tag_type": "PER"}, "UnitedHealth": {"name": "UnitedHealth", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "ransomware": {"name": "ransomware", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Uncle Sam to inject $50M into auto-patcher for hospital IT"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-22T01:16:52.434286", "id": "dafe2a6b-7dcc-4783-be22-a671aa65930e", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "5"}], "created": "2024-05-22T00:45:00", "id": "a62fb11a-a340-4679-833b-2ec2be3cd87d", "news_items": [{"author": "BeauHD", "content": "Windows Now Has AI-Powered Copy and Paste 2\nUmar Shakir reports via The Verge: Microsoft is adding a new Advanced Paste feature to PowerToys for Windows 11 that can convert your clipboard content on the fly with the power of AI.

Azure Site Recovery now offers an improved alerting solution for Azure Site Recovery on Azure Monitor. This includes default alerts via Azure Monitor, which will enable you to have consistent experience for alert management across different Azure services.  \n \nWith Azure Monitor based alerts, you can route alerts to any notification channel supported by Azure Monitor, such as email, Webhook, Logic app, and more. You can also use other alert management capabilities offered by Azure Monitor, for example, suppressing notifications during a planned maintenance window, correlate alerts, etc.\u202f \n\u202f \nBenefits of Azure Monitor \n \n\nAbility to configure notifications to a wide range of notification channels -\u202fAzure Monitor supports a wide range of notification channels such as email, ITSM, webhooks, logic apps, and so on. You can configure notifications for backup alerts to any of these channels without needing to spend too much time creating custom integrations. \nAbility to select which scenarios to get notified about -\u202fWith Azure Monitor alerts, you can choose which scenarios to get notified about. You also have the flexibility to choose whether to enable notifications for test subscriptions or not. \nAbility to manage alerts and notifications programmatically\u202f-\u202fYou can leverage\u202fAzure Monitor\u2019s REST APIs\u202fto manage alerts and notifications via non-portal clients as well. \nAbility to have a consistent alerts management experience for multiple Azure services including backup -\u202fAzure Monitor is the established paradigm for monitoring resources across Azure. With the integration of Azure Backup with Azure Monitor, backup alerts can be managed in the same way as alerts for other Azure services without requiring a separate paradigm. \n\n\n\u2003\n \n \nAlerts scenarios\u202f \n\u202f \nAzure Site Recovery sends a default alert (surfaced via Azure Monitor) whenever any of the following critical events occur:\u202f \n\nEnable disaster recovery failure alerts for Azure VM, Hyper-V, and VMware replication.\u202f\u00a0\nReplication health critical alerts for Azure VM, Hyper-V, and VMware replication.\u202f\u00a0\nAzure Site Recovery agent version expiry alerts for Azure VM and Hyper-V replication.\u202f\u00a0\nAzure Site Recovery agent not reachable alerts for Hyper-V replication.\u202f\u00a0\nFailover failure alerts for Azure VM, Hyper-V, and VMware replication.\u202f\u00a0\nAuto certification expiry alerts for Azure VM replication.\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u202f\u00a0\nTo test the working of the alerts for a test VM using Azure Site Recovery, you can disable public network access for the cache storage account so that a Replication Health turned to critical alert is generated.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u202f\u00a0\nNotifications\u00a0\n\u202f\u00a0\nThe built-in alerts can be consumed via the Azure portal or other clients such as Azure PowerShell, CLI and REST API.\u00a0\nIn many cases, you might also want to configure notifications for these alerts - for example, email. To configure notifications, you can leverage Azure Monitor\u2019s\u202fAction Groups\u202fand\u202fAction Rules.\u00a0\n\nAn\u202fAction Group\u202fis a collection of notification preferences defined by the owner of an Azure subscription. Azure Monitor alerts use action groups to notify you that an alert has been triggered. Various alerts may use the same action group or different action groups depending on your requirements. As highlighted earlier, Azure Monitor supports a wide range of action groups, including email, ITSM, webhooks, logic apps, and so on.\u202f\u00a0\nAn\u202fAction Rule\u202flets you associate alerts to action groups. Action rules provide rich flexibility in allowing you to specify the scope of resources to which an action group should be attached, and the alert scenarios for which notifications should be generated.\u00a0\n\n\u202f\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nFor configuring notifications to other channels, you can refer to the Azure Monitor\u202fdocumentation pages.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nManage Azure Site Recovery Alerts\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn addition to enabling management of alerts on Azure Monitor, Azure Site Recovery also provides an alert management experience on Recovery Services Vault, Business Continuity Center and Backup Center.

These alerts are generated by default, without any need for rule configuration. However, to enable notifications (for example, email notifications) for these generated alerts, you must create an alert processing rule.\u202f\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQ. What will happen to the classic alerts for azure site recovery?\u00a0\nA. For a period of time, the earlier classic alerts solution will co-exist with the newer Azure Monitor-based solution. This is meant to provide you sufficient time to familiarize yourself with the new experience. It is recommended to switch to using Action Groups for notifications as Azure Monitor integration is the forward-looking alerting and notification solution for Azure Backup. Note that the alerts visible in Backup center are all based on the Azure Monitor-based solution. Alerts generated by the earlier solution cannot be viewed in Backup center.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQ. Do I pay for the built-in alerts for site recovery on Azure Monitor?\u00a0\nA. The alerts are fired by default and come at no additional cost. If you choose to configure notifications (action rules) for these alerts, notifications are free up to the limits specified in the free tier. If the volume of notifications falls beyond the free tier, there is a minor cost involved for the additional notifications generated. Refer to\u202fthis page\u202fto learn more about the free tier for notifications and the cost of notifications beyond the free tier.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nQ. What if I want to create alerts based on custom rules, in addition to the built-in alerts?\u00a0\nA. The Azure BCDR team is actively working on enhancements in custom alerting.

Malte Elson, writing at Nature: Just as many industries devote hefty funding to incentivizing people to find and report bugs and glitches, so the science community should reward the detection and correction of errors in the scientific literature. In our industry, too, the costs of undetected errors are staggering. That's why I have joined with meta-scientist Ian Hussey at the University of Bern and psychologist Ruben Arslan at Leipzig University in Germany to pilot a bug-bounty programme for science, funded by the University of Bern. Our project, Estimating the Reliability and Robustness of Research (ERROR), pays specialists to check highly cited published papers, starting with the social and behavioural sciences (see go.nature.com/4bmlvkj). Our reviewers are paid a base rate of up to 1,000 Swiss francs (around US$1,100) for each paper they check, and a bonus for any errors they find. The bigger the error, the greater the reward -- up to a maximum of 2,500 francs.\nAuthors who let us scrutinize their papers are compensated, too: 250 francs to cover the work needed to prepare files or answer reviewer queries, and a bonus 250 francs if no errors (or only minor ones) are found in their work. ERROR launched in February and will run for at least four years. So far, we have sent out almost 60 invitations, and 13 sets of authors have agreed to have their papers assessed. One review has been completed, revealing minor errors. I hope that the project will demonstrate the value of systematic processes to detect errors in published research. I am convinced that such systems are needed, because current checks are insufficient. Unpaid peer reviewers are overburdened, and have little incentive to painstakingly examine survey responses, comb through lists of DNA sequences or cell lines, or go through computer code line by line. Mistakes frequently slip through. And researchers have little to gain personally from sifting through published papers looking for errors. There is no financial compensation for highlighting errors, and doing so can see people marked out as troublemakers.\nAuthors who let us scrutinize their papers are compensated, too: 250 francs to cover the work needed to prepare files or answer reviewer queries, and a bonus 250 francs if no errors (or only minor ones) are found in their work.

The core point of research is to find out what is true, and the person who spots a mistake in a scientific paper should be praised, not rejected.\nPerhaps a solution lies in penalising the institution of the authors of a paper that proves seriously flawed.

Dragos, an industrial cybersecurity firm, specializes in providing software, cyber threat intelligence, and professional services to protect critical infrastructure. SANS, in partnership with Dragos, present a new blog series that delves into the critical aspects of OT cybersecurity. This series aims to educate both practitioners and executives on the intricacies of securing operational environments. This is Part 2. If you\u00e2re new to this blog series, read Part 1 here.\nIn an era where technology increasingly governs the industrial landscape, the integration of Operational Technology (OT) into our daily lives has never been more apparent. With critical infrastructure spanning sectors like manufacturing, utilities, and transportation relying heavily on these systems, securing OT has become paramount. This blog explores the complex world of OT to unpack key components, systems, and critical security implications of modern industrial operations.\nJoin us for the SANS ICS Security Summit from June 16-24 in Orlando, Florida, for hands-on learning and networking with top ICS experts. Register now!\nDecoding OT Architecture\nIt is essential that professionals transitioning from IT to OT have a firm understanding of OT architecture. Using the Purdue Model of Industrial Control Systems, for instance, provides a layered architecture for IT and OT integration, from enterprise-level IT operations to real-time OT processing. This structure is important in grasping how data flows and is secured across different levels of industrial operations.\nExploring Key OT Devices and Systems\nOT encompasses a variety of devices and systems crucial for the safe operation of critical infrastructure. These include:\nProgrammable Logic Controllers (PLCs): These are the brains behind the automation of industrial processes, ensuring high reliability and ease of programming.\n-\nRemote Terminal Units (RTUs): These devices facilitate remote monitoring and control, transmitting data between site locations and central control systems.\n-\nIndustrial Control Systems (ICS) and Distributed Control Systems (DCS): These systems manage, command, and regulate industrial processes, ensuring operational continuity and safety.\n-\nHuman-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems: These interfaces and systems provide crucial data visualization and process control capabilities across extensive industrial operations.\n-\nAddressing OT Security Challenges\nWith the convergence of IT and OT, and the ever-increasing number of cyber threats, the need for robust security measures tailored to the unique challenges of OT environments cannot be understated. Continuous monitoring, specific incident response strategies, and a defensible architecture to protect against potential cyber threats are of the upmost importance.\nAs OT becomes increasingly integrated with IT and subjected to sophisticated cyber threats, the importance of specialized education and proactive security measures cannot be overstated. By understanding the foundational elements of OT and prioritizing comprehensive security protocols, professionals can ensure the resilience and efficiency of essential industrial operations, safeguarding the backbone of our modern society.\nUpcoming Learning and Engagement Opportunities\nAre you looking to further your understanding of the complexities of OT systems?
