It's understood Kramer wanted Biden supporters to stay home, giving House Rep Dean Phillips (D-MN) a better chance at being selected to challenge Joe Biden for the New Hampshire Democratic nomination.\n\"This is a way for me to make a difference, and I have,\" an unapologetic Kramer told NBC News. \"For $500, I got about $5 million worth of action, whether that be media attention or regulatory action.\"\nThat 500 bucks will be for the whole caper, we understand; the magic man was given $150 to do the deepfake part.\nMan admits to paying magician $150 to create anti-Biden robocall\n-\nRobocaller spoofing Joe Biden is telling people not to vote in New Hampshire\n-\nEx-White House election threat hunter weighs in on what to expect in November\n-\nGraph database shows Biden outspends Trump in social media ad war\n-\nIn late January, both the New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella and the FCC opened investigations into reports of voters receiving spoofed robocalls.\nOn Thursday, the AG announced Kramer has been charged with 13 felony counts of voter suppression and 13 misdemeanor counts of impersonation of a candidate, spread across four counties based on the residence of 13 New Hampshire residents who received the Biden robocalls.\n\"I hope that our respective enforcement actions send a strong deterrent signal to anyone who might consider interfering with elections, whether through the use of artificial intelligence or otherwise,\" Formella said in a statement.\nAlso on Thursday, the FCC proposed fining Kramer $6 million for election misinformation and unlawful call spoofing.\nTo spread the fake messages, Kramer hired Voice Broadcasting, which used the services of Life Corporation to transmit calls through voice service provider Lingo Telecom, the US watchdog said.\n\"Lingo Telecom transmitted these calls, incorrectly labeling them with the highest level of caller ID attestation, making it less likely that other providers could detect the calls as potentially spoofed,\" according to the FCC, which also proposed a $2 million penalty against Lingo.\nIf finalized, this will be the first-ever enforcement action related to spoofed, deepfake robocalls in the US. \u00ae", "hash": "9605e1974210b97008c3e59123740467c3134dc8a9a268ee88a7815ca2115fe1", "id": "47657b4a-817e-4223-ac5b-b11b2d9bf4be", "link": "https://go.theregister.com/feed/www.theregister.com/2024/05/24/biden_robocall_charges/", "osint_source_id": "a94d3f15-5689-470c-9d1f-670b8c63491d", "published": "2024-05-24T23:21:14", "source": "http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/headlines.atom", "story_id": "c77cd1fb-5a5a-4dc8-879b-7d2455e03481", "title": "Man behind deepfake Biden robocall indicted on felony charges, faces $6M fine"}], "tags": {"AI-generated": {"name": "AI-generated", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Biden": {"name": "Biden", "tag_type": "PER"}, "D-MN": {"name": "D-MN", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Democratic": {"name": "Democratic", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "FCC": {"name": "FCC", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Formella": {"name": "Formella", "tag_type": "PER"}, "House": {"name": "House", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Joe Biden": {"name": "Joe Biden", "tag_type": "PER"}, "John Formella": {"name": "John Formella", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Kramer": {"name": "Kramer", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Life Corporation": {"name": "Life Corporation", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Lingo Telecom": {"name": "Lingo Telecom", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "New Hampshire": {"name": "New Hampshire", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "New Orleans": {"name": "New Orleans", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Steven Kramer": {"name": "Steven Kramer", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Trump": {"name": "Trump", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Voice Broadcasting": {"name": "Voice Broadcasting", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "anti-Biden": {"name": "anti-Biden", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Man behind deepfake Biden robocall indicted on felony charges, faces $6M fine"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-25T01:19:14.006105", "id": "47ccc6ad-3d79-4cb3-810f-6646b5964a3b", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "6"}], "created": "2024-05-24T23:20:00", "id": "2e6ebd04-2325-42a4-9baf-94d0f308bf20", "news_items": [{"author": "BeauHD", "content": "UK Law Will Let Regulators Fine Big Tech Without Court Approval (theverge.com) 3\nEmma Roth reports via The Verge: The UK could subject big tech companies to hefty fines if they don't comply with new rules meant to promote competition in digital markets.

The DMCC also addresses consumer protection issues by banning fake reviews, forcing companies to be more transparent about their subscription contracts, regulating secondary ticket sales, and getting rid of hidden fees. It will also force certain companies to report mergers to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The European Union enacted a similar law, called the Digital Markets Act (DMA).\nOnly the companies the CMA designates as having Strategic Market Status (SMS) have to comply.

The law will also give the CMA the authority to determine whether a company has broken a law, require compliance, and issue a fine -- all without going through the court system. The CMA can fine companies up to 10 percent of the total value of a business's global revenue for violating the new rules.\nOnly the companies the CMA designates as having Strategic Market Status (SMS) have to comply.

Users employ it to encrypt entire hard drives to prevent people from reading or modifying data in the event they get physical access to the disk. Starting with the rollout of Windows 10, BitLocker by default has used the 128-bit and 256-bit XTS-AES encryption algorithm, giving the feature extra protection from attacks that rely on manipulating cipher text to cause predictable changes in plain text.\nRecently, researchers from security firm Kaspersky found a threat actor using BitLocker to encrypt data on systems located in Mexico, Indonesia, and Jordan. The researchers named the new ransomware ShrinkLocker, both for its use of BitLocker and because it shrinks the size of each non-boot partition by 100 MB and splits the newly unallocated space into new primary partitions of the same size.\n\u201cOur incident response and malware analysis are evidence that attackers are constantly refining their tactics to evade detection,\u201d the researchers wrote Friday. \u201cIn this incident, we observed the abuse of the native BitLocker feature for unauthorized data encryption.\u201d\nShrinkLocker isn\u2019t the first malware to leverage BitLocker. In 2022, Microsoft reported that ransomware attackers with a nexus to Iran also used the tool to encrypt files. That same year, the Russian agricultural business Miratorg was attacked by ransomware that used BitLocker to encrypt files residing in the system storage of infected devices.\nOnce installed on a device, ShrinkLocker runs a VisualBasic script that first invokes the Windows Management Instrumentation and Win32_OperatingSystem class to obtain information about the operating system.\n\u201cFor each object within the query results, the script checks if the current domain is different from the target,\u201d the Kaspersky researchers wrote. \u201cIf it is, the script finishes automatically. After that, it checks if the name of the operating system contains 'xp,' '2000,' '2003,' or 'vista,' and if the Windows version matches any one of these, the script finishes automatically and deletes itself.\u201d\nThe script then continues to use the WMI for querying information about the OS. It goes on to perform the disk resizing operations, which can vary depending on the OS version detected. The ransomware performs these operations only on local, fixed drives. The decision to leave network drives alone is likely motivated by the desire not to trigger network detection protections.\nEventually, ShrinkLocker disables protections designed to secure the BitLocker encryption key and goes on to delete them. It then enables the use of a numerical password, both as a protector against anyone else taking back control of BitLocker and as an encryptor for system data. The reason for deleting the default protectors is to disable key recovery features by the device owner. ShrinkLocker then goes on to generate a 64-character encryption key using random multiplication and replacement of:\nA variable with the numbers 0\u20139;\n-\nThe famous pangram, \u201cThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,\u201d in lowercase and uppercase, which contains every letter of the English alphabet;\n-\nSpecial characters.\n-\nAfter several additional steps, data is encrypted. The next time the device reboots, the display looks like this:\nDecrypting drives without the attacker-supplied key is difficult and likely impossible in many cases. While it is possible to recover some of the passphrases and fixed values used to generate the keys, the script uses variable values that are different on each infected device. These variable values aren\u2019t easy to recover.\nThere are no protections specific to ShrinkLocker for preventing successful attacks.

Google has been telling people its AI box at the top of search results is the future, and you can't turn it off, but that ignores how Google search works: A lot of options are powered by URL parameters. That means you can turn off AI search with this one simple trick! (Sorry.) Our method for killing AI search is defaulting to the new \"web\" search filter, which Google recently launched as a way to search the web without Google's alpha-quality AI junk. It's actually pretty nice, showing only the traditional 10 blue links, giving you a clean (well, other than the ads), uncluttered results page that looks like it's from 2011. Sadly, Google's UI doesn't have a way to make \"web\" search the default, and switching to it means digging through the \"more\" options drop-down after you do a search, so it's a few clicks deep.\nCheck out the URL after you do a search, and you'll see a mile-long URL full of esoteric tracking information and mode information. We'll put each search result URL parameter on a new line so the URL is somewhat readable [...]. Most of these only mean something to Google's internal tracking system, but that \"&udm=14\" line is the one that will put you in a web search. Tack it on to the end of a normal search, and you'll be booted into the clean 10 blue links interface. While Google might not let you set this as a default, if you have a way to automatically edit the Google search URL, you can create your own defaults. One way to edit the search URL is a proxy site like udm14.com, which is probably the biggest site out there popularizing this technique. A proxy site could, if it wanted to, read all your search result queries, though (your query is also in the URL), so whether you trust this site is up to you.\nCheck out the URL after you do a search, and you'll see a mile-long URL full of esoteric tracking information and mode information.

The company promotes its products through various platforms\nand incentivizes customer loyalty with their app, which allows users to collect\npoints for rewards. The company's headquarters is located in Germany, and their\nproducts are widely available both online and in retail stores.\"\nSource: https://www.4bro.de\nBusiness recommendation:\n------------------------\nThe vendor has fixed the security issues in the API server as of 2024-04-17.\nSEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of the product\nconducted by security professionals to identify and resolve potential further\nsecurity issues.\nVulnerability overview/description:\n-----------------------------------\n1) Broken access control via IDOR in 4BRO app API\nAn IDOR vulnerability (Insecure Direct Object Reference) allows an attacker\nto change the username in the Bearer token used for authentication in the 4BRO app.\nThis leads to account takeover as a result of broken access control (poor Bearer\ntoken verification). Attackers are able to access all data or Bro points (\"broins\")\nfrom other users.\n2) API Information Exposure\nWhen opening the app as an unauthenticated user, the 4BRO app loads JSON data\nfrom a publicly available API endpoint containing sensitive data like e-mail\naddresses of employees, internal invoices, a CV including personal information,\na gift card etc.\nProof of concept:\n-----------------\n1) Broken access control via IDOR in 4BRO app API\nWhen logging in into the 4BRO app, the server returns a JWT (JSON Web Token).\nThe \"login\" HTTP request looks like this:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPOST /api/user/signin HTTP/2\nHost: adminpanel.4bro.de\nContent-Type: application/json\n[...]\n{\"email\":\"\",\"password\":\"\"}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe server responds with a JWT used for authentication and additional\naccount-related data:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHTTP/2 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\n[...]\n{\n\"token\": \"\",\n\"userData\": {\n\"isBlocked\": false,\n\"_id\": \"[...]\",\n\"userType\": \"USER\",\n\"email\": \"\",\n\"broins\": 0,\n\"deviceId\": null,\n\"userCreationDate\": \"2023-XX-XXTXX:XX:XX.XXXZ\",\n\"address\": [{\n\"_id\": \"[...]\",\n\"streetName\": \"[...]\",\n\"streetNumber\": \"[...]\",\n\"postalcode\": \"[...]\",\n\"city\": \"[...]\",\n\"firstName\": \"[...]\",\n\"lastName\": \"[...]\",\n\"country\": \"at\"\n}\n],\n\"ratings\": [],\n\"__v\": 0,\n\"pushToken\": \"[...]\",\n\"telekomUUID\": \"[...]\"\n}\n}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBecause the JWT is only base64-encoded, it is easy to decode the JWT's\nheader and payload as clear text using JWT decoders like https://token.dev/:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHeader:\n{\n\"kid\": \"[...]\",\n\"alg\": \"RS256\"\n}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPayload:\n{\n\"sub\": \"[...]\",\n\"event_id\": \"[...]\",\n\"token_use\": \"access\",\n\"scope\": \"aws.cognito.signin.user.admin\",\n\"auth_time\": 1683565567,\n\"iss\": \"https://cognito-idp.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/[...]\",\n\"exp\": 1683569167,\n\"iat\": 1683565567,\n\"jti\": \"[...]\",\n\"client_id\": \"[...]\",\n\"username\": \"\"\n}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe payload of the JWT contains multiple values indicating that AWS Cognito is in use.\nBy changing the \"username\" value of the JWT payload to a victim email, it is possible\nto use the modified JWT for authenticating as the victim. The victim should already\nhave a normally registered account in the 4BRO app. By trial and error, it turns out\nthat even the following modified JWT payload gets accepted by the server:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n{\n\"sub\": \"0\",\n\"event_id\": \"0\",\n\"token_use\": \"access\",\n\"scope\": \"aws.cognito.signin.user.admin\",\n\"auth_time\": 0,\n\"iss\": \"\",\n\"exp\": 0,\n\"iat\": 0,\n\"jti\": \"0\",\n\"client_id\": \"0\",\n\"username\": \"\"\n}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMeanwhile, the \"kid\" property in the JWT header must be a valid value, but can belong\nto any other already existing 4BRO app account. The JWT signature can be the same\nand does not get verified at all.\nUsing the modified JWT, all API methods supported by the 4BRO app can be executed.\nBecause the server only checks the \"username\" property in the JWT payload and does\nslim to none JWT verification, the server thinks that the request came from the\naccount associated with the login email contained in the \"username\" property.\nThis way, sensitive data such as the current \"broin\" balance, full user data as seen\nin the login response, previous transactions, redeemed vouchers and goodies etc.\ncan be accessed without restrictions, using the 4BRO API. Also, the \"sending broins\"\naction can be performed so that earned \"broins\" could be transferred to an attacker's\naccount balance.\n2) API Information Exposure\nBy monitoring the 4BRO app's requests over a proxy, it can be observed that\nthe following HTTP request is made when opening the \"Goodies\" section of the app:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGET /api/goodies?pageSize=1000 HTTP/2\nHost: adminpanel.4bro.de\n[...]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe response is a JSON object containing all goodies that are or were at some point\navailable in the 4BRO app:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHTTP/2 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nContent-Length: 327138\n[...]\n{\n\"goodiesList\": [{\n\"_id\": \"61950603005c650530b63aac\",\n\"name\": \"1x 4BRO Getr\u00e4nk Imbiss\",\n\"longDescription\": \"[...]\",\n\"shortDescription\": \"Auf unseren Nacken!\",\n\"imagePath\":\n\"https://broappasset-prod.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/goodies/app_kachel_food_256x256.jpg\",\n\"category\": \"Food\",\n\"quantity\": 999999999999808,\n\"costOfGoodie\": 250,\n\"supplier\": \"\",\n\"totalGoodies\": 999999999999861,\n\"goodieAvailableTime\": \"Unlimited\",\n\"deliveryMethod\": \"partnerCoupon\",\n\"isNewGoodie\": false,\n\"inhouseAppVoucherUrl\":\n\"https://broappasset-prod.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/inhouseAppVouchers/undefined\",\n\"__v\": 1,\n\"rating\": {\n\"value\": 3.991869918699184,\n\"total\": 123\n},\n\"forceGoodie\": \"true\",\n\"goodieAvailableEndTime\": null,\n\"goodieAvailableStartTime\": null,\n\"restriction\": [],\n\"hidden\": false,\n\"slashedCostOfGoodie\": null\n},{\n[...]\n},\n[...]\n}\n],\n\"goodieCount\": 371\n}\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis JSON object contains already sensitive data such as the goodie supplier's email\naddresses. Out of the 371 goodies, 36 of those have a URL to a PDF file contained\nwithin the \"inhouseAppVoucherUrl\" property. Because these files are hosted on an\nAWS S3 bucket, everyone can access these documents without authentication.\nThese documents seem to contain various sensitive company internal and personal\ninformation.\nWhile discovering vulnerability 1), we found that old gift codes were also stored as\nPDF files on the AWS S3 bucket. The names of the gift code PDF files indicate that\nthere may be more similarly named documents (IDOR) which could be detected in an\nautomated way. This could be leveraged to find additional gift code PDF files stored\non the AWS S3 bucket.\nVulnerable / tested versions:\n-----------------------------\nThe following app version has been tested and downloaded through Google Play store,\nwhich was the most recent version available at the time of the test:\n* 3.14.7\nBecause the vulnerability is actually server-side within the API, the iOS app was\nalso affected at the time the vulnerabilities were discovered.\nVendor contact timeline:\n------------------------\n2023-06-12: Contacting vendor through broservice@4bro.de (owner) and info@dev5310.com\n(developers according to Google Play store)\n2023-06-15: Vendor asks about the risks of the identified vulnerabilities and which\nparts of the application are affected and whether any costs would arise\nbefore they provide us with a security contact.\n2023-06-16: Detailed answer regarding risk estimation, responsible disclosure and\nthat no costs are involved.\n2023-06-19: Vendor requests a phone conference, scheduled for 21st June.\n2023-06-21: Clarifying responsible disclosure, explaining vulnerabilities and next\nsteps in phone call.

They will have to call the Division of Finance. To our knowledge, we are not aware of any data exfiltration.\u201d\nThe county did not respond to several followup questions about when the incident started, whether it is a ransomware attack or whether federal law enforcement agencies will be called on for assistance.\nThe cyberattack, first reported by the Times Union newspaper, affects a county with more than 310,000 residents. The Times Union noted that from 2019 to 2021, the county dealt with ransomware attacks on the local airport, a 911 dispatch center and the city of Albany itself.\nLast month the statehouse was also attacked by a ransomware gang that targeted the systems used by New York\u2019s legislature to draft and print bills.\nSince a devastating attack on one of the state\u2019s most affluent counties in 2021, the governor has made cybersecurity a pillar of her work, recently announcing changes to state cybersecurity rules that force regulated entities to report ransomware payments and take other measures to secure customer data.\nGov. Kathy Hochul tapped former company commander at the U.S. Army Cyber Brigade, Colin Ahern, to be the state\u2019s first-ever chief cyber officer in June 2022 and added an extra $35 million to the state\u2019s $61.9 million cybersecurity budget last year.\nRansomware attackers have continued to target U.S. county and city governments.

One of its installers is believed to have been poisoned by an unknown attacker and anyone running JAVS Viewer v8.3.7 should probably spring into action right away.\nMitigating the threat, tracked as CVE-2024-4978 (8.7), is a little more technical than simply upgrading to a secured version. Given that the backdoor allowed attackers full access to infected systems, and as a result could have established persistence, Rapid7 analysts say a full re-imaging job is required.\n\"Reimage any endpoints where JAVS Viewer 8.3.7 was installed,\" the ten-strong analyst crew blogged. \"Simply uninstalling the software is insufficient, as attackers may have implanted additional backdoors or malware. Re-imaging provides a clean slate.\n\"Reset credentials for any accounts that were logged into affected endpoints. This includes local accounts on the endpoint itself as well as any remote accounts accessed during the period when JAVS Viewer 8.3.7 was installed. Attackers may have stolen credentials from compromised systems.\"\nCredentials used in web browsers should also be reset since sessions could be hijacked to steal cookies, passwords, and other secrets. Only after these steps are taken should users install the latest safe version of the software (8.3.9 or later).\nExamining the installer, Ipek Solak, the detection and response analyst at Rapid7 who discovered the issue, spotted a binary called fffmpeg.exe that was quickly outed as one that provided remote access via a command and control (C2) server.\nQuick note: any sightings of ffmpeg.exe in the installer are fine \u2013 it's supposed to be there. Three f's mean you're in trouble. Two is fine.\nfffmpeg.exe has previously been linked with the known GateDoor/Rustdoor malware family first discovered by S2W earlier this year, and running its SHA1 hash through VirusTotal reveals multiple vendors flagging it as a malicious dropper. It was, we're told, also signed using a certificate registered to \"Vanguard Tech Limited\", rather than \"Justice AV Solutions Inc\" like all the other legitimate files in the installer.\nIn practice, the binary collected system details and sent them back to the attacker via the C2 channel. It allowed attackers to run obfuscated PowerShell scripts, which were revealed to bypass anti-malware protections, disable Event Tracing for Windows, and download an additional payload.\nAttackers would then use additional binaries to scrape browser credentials, hence the need for potential victims to reset theirs before upgrading to a safe version.\nDisclosure timeline and JAVS' response\nThe first eyes on JAVS came in early April after a threat intelligence researcher at S2W Xeeted about malware being hosted on the vendor's downloads page, but it didn't get much attention at the time.\nIt was over a month later, on May 10, when a Rapid7 customer's MDR picked up an iffy-looking file, prompting the company's analysts to investigate. By the time Rapid7 traced the source to JAVS' downloads page, it reckons the malware was no longer hosted there.\nWe're still none the wiser as to why this is the case, or who removed it from the site. We got in touch with JAVS but didn't receive an immediate response.\nDays later, a separate malicious installer was found on the JAVS downloads page, different from the iffy file that thrust Rapid7 into action.\n\"This confirms that the vendor site was the source of the initial infection,\" Rapid7 claimed.\nWe couldn't get a hold of JAVS for its side of the story, but it did provide a statement to the researchers, saying it worked with authorities to understand what was happening, and now believes its downloads page is safe and free from malware.\n70% of CISOs worry their org is at risk of a material cyber attack\n-\nUS government excoriates Microsoft for 'avoidable errors' but keeps paying for its products\n-\nMalicious xz backdoor reveals fragility of open source\n-\nMalware loader lowdown: The big 3 responsible for 80% of attacks so far this year\n-\n\"The file in question did not originate from JAVS or any 3rd party associated with JAVS,\" said the vendor. \"We highly encourage all users to verify that JAVS has digitally signed any JAVS software they install.\n\"Any files found signed by other parties should be considered suspect. We are revisiting our release process to strengthen file certification. We strongly suggest that customers keep updated with all software releases and security patches and use robust security measures, such as firewalls and malware protection.\"\nJAVS added that its own technicians usually install the software that was backdoored and they always validate their installations.\n\"We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a secure environment for all our users.

From a report: The state-imposed restrictions were repealed in an omnibus commerce policy bill signed on Tuesday by Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat. Minnesota was previously one of about 20 states that imposed significant restrictions on municipal broadband. The number can differ depending on who's counting because of disagreements over what counts as a significant restriction. But the list has gotten smaller in recent years because states including Arkansas, Colorado, and Washington repealed laws that hindered municipal broadband. The Minnesota bill enacted this week struck down a requirement that municipal telecommunications networks be approved in an election with 65 percent of the vote.

Allerdings erschwert die un\u00fcbersichtliche Modellvielfalt die Auswahl. Ein Gaming-Monitor macht zus\u00e4tzlich durch auff\u00e4llige Design-Elemente und RGB-Beleuchtung auf sich aufmerksam, was ihn von klassischen B\u00fcro-Bildschirmen unterscheidet.\nRaffinierte Standf\u00fc\u00dfe, farbige Geh\u00e4useteile und LEDs auf der Monitorr\u00fcckseite unterstreichen den Spielecharakter. Vielfach sind auch die Gaming-Schirme rahmenlos konstruiert, damit sich m\u00f6glichst \u00fcbergangslos mehrere Displays zu einem Multi-Monitor-Setup nebeneinander gruppieren lassen. Im Hinblick auf Ergonomie im Homeoffice (Ratgeber) bieten Gaming-Monitore h\u00e4ufig mehr Einstellm\u00f6glichkeiten, was zus\u00e4tzlich einen Kaufanreiz schafft.\nUnd auch wenn sich der Spiele-Bildschirm in erster Linie das Gaming auf die Fahnen schreibt, meistert er nat\u00fcrlich auch alle anderen Aufgaben m\u00fchelos. Das gilt f\u00fcrs Arbeiten genauso wie f\u00fcrs Anschauen von Filmen und Serien oder kreative T\u00e4tigkeiten \u2013 etwa das Bearbeiten von Fotos oder Videos. Da jedoch nicht alle g\u00fcnstigen Spiele-Displays automatisch alle Anforderungen ans sorgenfreie Gaming erf\u00fcllen, helfen diese Tipps bei der Kaufentscheidung.\nEinfache Bildschirme zum Arbeiten zu Hause zeigt unser Artikel Displays: G\u00fcnstige Monitore unter 180 Euro f\u00fcr Arbeit, Surfen, Gaming. Eine praktische Erg\u00e4nzung zum Monitor sind spezielle Lampen, die besten Modelle zeigt unsere Top 10 Screenbars: Die besten Monitorlampen f\u00fcr Display & Schreibtisch im Test.\nWas ist wichtig bei Gaming-Monitoren?\nDer Hauptunterschied zwischen einem Gaming-Monitor und einem Standard-Bildschirm f\u00fcrs B\u00fcro und Homeoffice liegt in der Bildwiederholrate und Reaktionszeit. Gew\u00f6hnliche Bildschirme flimmern mit 60 bis 75 Hertz, Gaming-Monitore schaffen mindestens 120 Hertz, in Extremf\u00e4llen sind bis zu 360 Hertz m\u00f6glich. Durch die h\u00f6here Frequenz wirken Animationen bei Spielgrafik viel fl\u00fcssiger und damit lebendiger. Allerdings muss hier die Grafikkarte auch mitspielen. Bildschirme f\u00fcr Spiele bietet zudem schnelle Reaktionszeiten.\nOft sind bereits Gaming-Monitore f\u00fcr Einsteiger mit vielf\u00e4ltigen Ergonomie-Funktionen ausgestattet. Sie dienen zum Anpassen an den Aufstellort und lohnen sich, um eine m\u00f6glichst optimale Spielposition zu erreichen. Der Monitor sollte sich neigen und in der H\u00f6he verstellen lassen. Mehr M\u00f6glichkeiten wie ein drehbarer Standfu\u00df oder das Hochkantstellen (Pivot) des Schirms k\u00f6nnen zudem nicht schaden.\nDen Gaming-Charakter unterstreichen neben hohen Bildraten und dem Einsatz von Synchronisationstechniken auch zus\u00e4tzliche elektronische Hilfsmittel im Onscreen-Men\u00fc. Sie dienen dazu, die Gaming-Performance weiter zu steigern. Verbreitet sind Einstellungen, die dunkle Bildbereiche aufhellen, um Details besser und schneller erkennen zu k\u00f6nnen.\nZu den spielespezifischen Features geh\u00f6ren etwa Fadenkreuz-Overlays, die in Shootern das schnellere Erfassen von Gegnern erm\u00f6glichen, oder Spielemodi f\u00fcr Rennen oder FPS (First-Person Shooter). Eher auf Ausdauer ausgelegt sind Features zum Schonen der Augen oder Blaulichtfilter, wie sie auch von Monitoren f\u00fcr B\u00fcro, Multimedia oder Grafik bekannt sind.\nWelche Gr\u00f6\u00dfe und Aufl\u00f6sung ben\u00f6tigt ein Gaming-Monitor?\nWie bei jedem Monitorkauf setzt der geplante Aufstellort die Grenze, wenn es um die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe des Gaming-Monitors geht. Dazu kommt das subjektive Empfinden sowie der verf\u00fcgbare Platz auf dem Schreibtisch. F\u00fcr den Einstieg in den Spielgenuss eignen sich zwei Diagonalen: 24 und 27 Zoll. Mittlerweile sind die gr\u00f6\u00dferen Ausf\u00fchrungen nur noch minimal teurerer.\nDie gew\u00e4hlte Gr\u00f6\u00dfe hat direkte Auswirkung auf die H\u00f6he der Aufl\u00f6sung. Bei einem 24-Zoll-Monitor ist Full-HD (1920 \u00d7 1080 Bildpunkte) ausreichend. Weniger Pixel d\u00fcrfen es auf keinen Fall sein. Bei einem 27 Z\u00f6ller ist schon eher WQHD (2560 \u00d7 1440 Bildpunkte) ratsam. Spieler, die einen sehr geringen Sitzabstand bevorzugen, k\u00f6nnen bei Full-HD noch einzelne Pixel erkennen.\nF\u00fcr Fans von Strategiespielen sind Diagonalen ab 31,5 Zoll eine interessante Option. Bildschirme in dieser Gr\u00f6\u00dfe sind mittlerweile bezahlbar und immer mehr im Kommen. Ab knapp unter 500 Euro findet man zudem Gaming-Monitore mit 4K-Aufl\u00f6sungen. Allerdings frisst die hohe Aufl\u00f6sung Performance. Es braucht dann jedoch eine enorm starke Grafikkarte, um Spiele hohen Details fl\u00fcssig darzustellen.\nWie viel kostet ein Gaming Monitor?\nEin preiswerter Gaming-Monitor mit 24 Zoll kostet derzeit zwischen 150 und 180 Euro. Diese bieten bereits eine hohe Bildwiederholfrequenz von bis zu 144 Hertz und schnelle Reaktionszeit von 1 ms. Gaming-Monitore mit 27 Zoll bekommt man ab 180 Euro. G\u00fcnstige 32-Zoll-Monitore f\u00fcr Gamer gibt es schon ab unter 300 Euro. Nach oben hin ist die Preisspanne nahezu offen. Gaming-Monitore mit 32 bis 34 Zoll k\u00f6nnen bis weit \u00fcber 2000 Euro kosten \u2013 es sei denn, man macht Abstriche bei Panel, Aufl\u00f6sung und Bildwiederholfrequenz.\nWelche Bildwiederholrate muss ein Gaming-Monitor haben?\nF\u00fcr Gaming-Monitore ist eine hohe Bildwiederholrate mit das wichtigste Kriterium. Das gilt auch f\u00fcr den Budget-Spielemonitor. Inzwischen sind 120 Hertz oder besser noch 144 Hertz auch f\u00fcr den Gaming-Einstieg ratsam und zum vertretbaren Preis m\u00f6glich. Selbst Bildschirme mit 165 Hertz sind mittlerweile bezahlbar. Der Kompromiss mit einem 60- oder 75-Hertz-Display muss daher nicht mehr sein.\nJe fl\u00fcssiger der Monitor das Spiel anzeigen kann, desto besser f\u00e4llt auch die Spielleistung aus. Dazu steigt das Spielgef\u00fchl, da sich jede Handlung verz\u00f6gerungsfrei und ohne Bildfehler durchf\u00fchren l\u00e4sst. Mit einem Gaming-Monitor ab 120 Hertz Bildwiederholrate lassen sich alle Spielearten realisieren \u2013 vom Strategie- oder Abenteuerspiel bis zum Shooter oder Rennspiel.\nDie Schirme beherrschen auch im g\u00fcnstigen Bereich Synchronisationstechnologien wie Adaptive Sync, Nvidias G-Sync oder AMDs Freesync. Hier stimmt sich die Grafikkarte mit dem Display ab, um immer die passende Bildwiederholrate auszuliefern. Damit wird Screen Tearing verhindert \u2013 ein unerw\u00fcnschter Effekt, der auch als Einzelbild-Zerrei\u00dfen bekannt ist und bei schnellen Bildwechseln auftritt. Welche Sync-Technik relevant ist, h\u00e4ngt von der Grafikkarte des Rechners ab: Freesync setzt eine AMD-Karte voraus, f\u00fcr G-Sync ist eine Grafikeinheit von Nvidia n\u00f6tig.\nDie schnellen Bildwiederholraten ben\u00f6tigen eine entsprechend potente Grafikkarte. In jedem Fall ist eine separate Grafikeinheit (Graphics Processing Unit: kurz GPU) Bedingung f\u00fcr richtigen Spa\u00df. F\u00fcrs Gaming in 1080p reicht eine Mittelklasse-Grafikkarte aus. Wer preisbewusst handelt, w\u00e4hlt anstelle einer Nvidia Geforce RTX 3060 oder AMD Radeon RX 6600 ein Vorg\u00e4ngerexemplar, um die hohe Performance von 144 Bildern pro Sekunde preisbewusst zu realisieren.\nWelche Reaktionszeit ben\u00f6tigt ein Gaming-Monitor?\nUnter der Reaktionszeit (Response Time) ist die Dauer, die ein Pixel ben\u00f6tigt, um von einer Farbe zu einer anderen zu wechseln. Gemessen wird das in Millisekunden (ms), je k\u00fcrzer, desto schneller reagiert das Display. Es gibt mehrere Methoden zur Messung der Reaktionszeit.\nEin wichtiges Kriterium ist GtG, das steht f\u00fcr gray-to-gray (Grau-zu-Grau) und misst die Geschwindigkeit beim Wechsel von Grauwerten. Daneben gibt es noch MPRT (Moving Picture Response Time), dieser Wert gibt nur die Leuchtdauer eines Pixels an. Relevanter ist hier GtG. Viele Hersteller geben eine Reaktionszeit von einer Millisekunde (ms) an \u2013 meinen damit aber den MPRT-Wert. Der GtG liegt dann oft bei 4 ms oder dar\u00fcber. Vor dem Kauf sollte man pr\u00fcfen, welche Methode die Hersteller angeben.\nEine zus\u00e4tzliche Orientierung gibt der Display-Typ. In puncto Blickwinkel und Farbstabilit\u00e4t kann das IPS-Panel (Inplane-Switching) seine St\u00e4rken ausspielen. Mit 178 Grad sind die Betrachtungswinkel sehr weit. Die bisherigen Nachteile der im Vergleich zu TN h\u00f6heren Panel-Preise und langsameren Reaktionszeiten haben sich inzwischen relativiert. Das verdankt die Panel-Technik Weiterentwicklungen wie Fast-IPS.\nF\u00fcrs schnelle Gameplay eignen sich VA-Panel im Vergleich zu den Mitbewerbern weniger. Dazu sind die Schaltzeiten mit ungef\u00e4hr 5 ms zu tr\u00e4ge. Wenn es im Spiel nicht ganz so flott zugeht, profitiert der Gamer von hoher Blickwinkelstabilit\u00e4t, guten Kontrasten und nat\u00fcrlicher Farbdarstellung. Zudem sind VA-Panels im Vergleich zum IPS-Panel g\u00fcnstiger. Unser Arbeitsplatz-Monitor mit 4K, 34 Zoll und 144 Hertz kostet so nur 314 Euro, w\u00e4hrend vergleichbare IPS-Modelle \u00fcber 470 Euro liegen.\nFr\u00fcher basierten noch viele, gerade eher g\u00fcnstige Monitore auf dem sogenannten TN-Panel (Twisted Nematic). Es ist vergleichsweise einfach im Aufbau und daher besonders g\u00fcnstig in der Herstellung. Der Vorteil von TN liegt eindeutig in der flotten Reaktionszeit. Zu den eklatanten Schw\u00e4chen z\u00e4hlen die schlechte Blickwinkelstabilit\u00e4t und Farbdarstellung. Da es mit VA eine \u00e4hnlich g\u00fcnstige Alternative mit weniger Nachteilen gibt und IPS-Panels deutlich im Preis gefallen sind, ist TN mittlerweile kein Thema f\u00fcr Gaming mehr. Entsprechend sollte man sie tunlichst meiden.\nImmer beliebter wird auch das OLED-Panel (Organic Light-emitting Diode). Dieses ist f\u00fcr seine besonders guten Schwarzwerte bekannt, da die Pixel im Panel selbstleuchtend sind und sich einzeln ansteuern lassen. So schaltet man bei dunklen Bildinhalten den entsprechenden Bereich einfach ab \u2013 was nicht nur gutes Schwarz liefert, sondern auch Strom spart. Ein Nachteil ist jedoch, dass OLED-Panels bei intensiver Nutzung einbrennen k\u00f6nnen. Entsprechende Gaming-Monitore sind zudem recht teuer und fangen bei 750 Euro an.\nDen Versuch, aus einem IPS-Panel ein OLED-\u00e4hnliches Erlebnis zu bekommen, unternimmt die sogenannte Mini-LED. Statt einer durchgehenden Hintergrundbeleuchtung im Monitor, gibt es viele kleine Leuchtzonen hinter dem Panel, die man so gezielter ansteuern kann. Bei dunklen Inhalten schaltet man diese Zone folglich einfach ab. Je mehr Zonen und je mehr Mini-LEDs, desto besser ist das Ergebnis.\nMit dem KTC M27P20 Pro (Testbericht) haben wir einen solchen, Gaming-f\u00e4higen 27-Zoll-Monitor mit 4K und 165 Hertz bereits getestet. Er kostet aktuell 600 Euro. Der Vorteil gegen\u00fcber OLED ist, dass das Panel weniger zum Einbrennen neigt. Entsprechende Ger\u00e4te sind aber noch rar und sehr teuer. Mehr zum Thema erkl\u00e4rt der Ratgeber Displays: G\u00fcnstige Monitore unter 180 Euro f\u00fcr Arbeit, Surfen, Gaming.\nWie sieht es mit HDR aus?\nGemeinhin wird der Hochkontrast (HDR \u2013 High Dynamic Range) mit UHD (Ultra High Definition) oder noch h\u00f6heren Aufl\u00f6sungen in Verbindung gebracht. Der Zusammenhang stammt aus dem Fernseher-Bereich. Allerdings sagt die Aufl\u00f6sung eines Monitors nichts \u00fcber die Darstellungsqualit\u00e4t von HDR-Inhalten aus.\nIn erster Linie h\u00e4ngt die HDR-F\u00e4higkeit mit der Helligkeit des Monitors zusammen. Ein Gaming-Schirm muss wie jeder andere Monitor bestimmte Helligkeitsvorgaben erf\u00fcllen, f\u00fcr die die VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) die Richtlinien in der Spezifikation \u201eDisplayHDR\u201c vorgegeben hat. Erf\u00fcllt ein Monitor die Mindeststufe, erreicht er eine Helligkeit von 400 cd/m\u00b2 auf 10 Prozent des Panels und h\u00e4lt sie \u00fcber eine Zeitspanne von einer halben Stunde. Gleichzeitig kann er eine Helligkeit von 320 cd/m\u00b2 auf der gesamten Anzeigefl\u00e4che wiedergeben.\nIn weiteren Stufen von 600 cd/m\u00b2 und 1000 cd/m\u00b2 geht der Standard inzwischen bis 1400 cd/m\u00b2 und wird von weiteren Kriterien wie der Abdeckung von Farbr\u00e4umen wie DCI-P3, der Farbtiefe oder bestimmter Schwarzwert-Vorgaben abgerundet. Erf\u00fcllt ein Monitor den Standard, erh\u00e4lt er gem\u00e4\u00df seiner Helligkeitsstufe das Logo \u201eDisplayHDR400\u201c und aufw\u00e4rts.\nF\u00fcr Einstiegs-Gaming-Monitore mit einer Diagonale von 24 Zoll und Full-HD-Aufl\u00f6sung ist HDR wenig sinnvoll. Der Unterschied zu SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) ist schlicht nicht erkennbar. Deshalb finden sich auch HDR-f\u00e4hige Gaming-Monitore erst ab einer Gr\u00f6\u00dfe von 27 Zoll \u2013 dann aber f\u00fcr beide Aufl\u00f6sungsstufen Full-HD und WQHD. Ein HDR-f\u00e4higer Monitor kostet etwas mehr. Allerdings gibt es auch im Einstiegs-Bereich preiswerte 27-Z\u00f6ller mit HDR.\nWelche Schnittstellen ben\u00f6tigt ein Gaming-Monitor?\nUm in Full-HD oder WQHD hohe Bildraten zu erreichen, braucht es einen entsprechend f\u00e4higen Anschluss. Pr\u00e4destiniert ist hier allen voran der Displayport-Anschluss (DP), da der verbreitete DP-1.4-Standard bereits 4K in 120 Hertz schafft. In der Regel bew\u00e4ltigt nur diese Schnittstelle die Kombination aus Synchronisierungstechnik und maximaler Bildwiederholrate. Trotzdem bieten auch g\u00fcnstige Gaming-Monitore weitere Schnittstellen wie HDMI-Ports. Das verbreitete HDMI 2.0 ist allerdings beschr\u00e4nkt auf maximal 144 Hertz bei WQHD, in 4K gehen nur maximal 60 Hertz. HDMI 2.1 ist der neuere Standard und hier nach M\u00f6glichkeit zu empfehlen. Damit ist dann 4K bei 120 Hertz, WQHD mit 240 Hertz und sogar 8K (60 Hertz) drin.\nSelbst bei g\u00fcnstigen Gaming-Monitoren finden sich oft USB-Ausg\u00e4nge am Bildschirm. Zun\u00e4chst erscheint das seltsam, ist im Monitor doch gar kein PC integriert. \u00dcber einen weiteren USB-Port, h\u00e4ufig USB-B, verbinden sie sich mit dem Computer. So sind diese f\u00fcrs Anschlie\u00dfen von Peripherieger\u00e4ten wie Tastaturen oder M\u00e4usen praktisch, lassen sich aber auch gut f\u00fcr externe Festplatten einsetzen. Das eingehende USB-Signal wird dazu einfach weitergegeben.\nEine vollumf\u00e4ngliche USB-C-Schnittstelle ist nur in Ausnahmef\u00e4llen vorhanden. Wer auf sie Wert legt, muss sich im h\u00f6herpreisigen Segment umsehen. Sie erleichtert insbesondere den Anschluss von modernen Laptops, die zumeist auf USB-C mit Videoausgang (per Displayport-Protokoll) setzen. Kann der Monitor dann noch Power-Delivery per USB-C, \u00fcbertragt der Laptop nicht nur Bild, sondern erh\u00e4lt auch direkt Strom. So gen\u00fcgt ein einziges Kabel, um alle relevanten Funktionen auf einmal zu verbinden. Alles Weitere dazu erkl\u00e4ren wir im Ratgeber Monitore ab 95 Euro: Darum sollte jeder Bildschirm USB-C haben.\nBesonders praktisch ist es auch, wenn Monitore eine integrierten KVM-Switch haben. So lassen sich angeschlossene Peripherieger\u00e4te ohne Umstecken mit mehreren Computern verbinden. Die Details erkl\u00e4rt unsere Bestenliste KVM-Switches. An einen solchen Monitor schlie\u00dft man also Tastatur, Maus & Co. sowie beide Rechner an. Per Knopfdruck im Bedienmen\u00fc des Bildschirms schaltet man entweder den einen oder den anderen Computer zu, der dann nicht nur sein Bild weitergibt, sondern auch Zugriff auf die angebundenen USB-Ger\u00e4te erh\u00e4lt.\nWir nutzen seit vielen Jahren den Gigabyte M27Q zum Zocken und Arbeiten und sind ausgesprochen zufrieden. F\u00fcr inzwischen nur noch 249 Euro (im Dezember 2023 noch \u00fcber 320 Euro) bekommt man einen 27-Zoll-Bildschirm mit WQHD und 170 Hertz \u2013 und eben einem KVM-Switch. Zudem gibt es einen USB-C-Port, allerdings ohne Power Delivery.\nWeitere Monitore mit HDMI 2.1, Displayport 2.0, USB-C oder KVM-Switch zeigen wir nachfolgend \u00fcber unseren Preisvergleich.\nWelche Vorteile hat ein Curved Display als Gaming-Monitor?\nGerade bei einem Spiele-Monitor ist ein gekr\u00fcmmtes Panel eine sinnvolle Idee. Durch die Biegung hat der Spieler die gesamte Fl\u00e4che besser im Blick und kann auch schneller reagieren, wenn sich etwas in den Ecken oder an den R\u00e4ndern abspielt. Das gilt insbesondere f\u00fcr Fans von Rennspielen oder Shootern. Viele Spieler bevorzugen die h\u00f6here Immersion. Dank der Kr\u00fcmmung steigt das Gef\u00fchl, tiefer im Spiel einzutauchen. Ob es im Einzelfall den kleinen Unterschied macht, ist eine sehr individuelle Empfindung.\nDie meisten Gaming-Monitore f\u00fcr den Einstieg nutzen als Seitenverh\u00e4ltnis 16:9. Das gilt auch dann, wenn das Panel gekr\u00fcmmt ist. Lohnenswert ist ein Curved-Bildschirm erst ab 27 Zoll. Denn bei einem kleineren 24-Z\u00f6ller l\u00e4sst sich Spielgeschehen \u00fcberwiegend noch \u00fcber die gesamte Bildfl\u00e4che hinweg genau im Auge behalten. Ultrabreite Monitor mit 21:9-Seitenverh\u00e4ltnis starten bei etwa 30 Zoll.\nWas sind die besten Gaming-Monitore?\nWas der beste Gaming-Monitor ist, h\u00e4ngt nat\u00fcrlich von den eigenen Vorlieben und dem Budget ab. Wer gerne 3D-Shooter spielt, dem reichen meistens 24 Zoll, mit 27 Zoll ist man auf der sicheren Seite. Hardcore-Strategiespieler k\u00f6nnen auch zu 32 Zoll greifen.\nBei den Bildwiederholraten sind 144 Hertz empfehlenswert. Die Reaktionszeit betr\u00e4gt mindestens 4 ms nach GtG. Als Panel ist IPS eine gute Wahl, da es eine sehr hohe Blickwinkelstabilit\u00e4t, die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Farbechtheit und mittlerweile trotzdem schnelle Reaktionszeiten zul\u00e4sst. VA-Panels sind daf\u00fcr etwas g\u00fcnstiger. Als Aufl\u00f6sung reicht in unseren Augen WQHD.\nUnter den Gaming-Monitoren mit starkem Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis \u00fcberzeugten uns im Test der Samsung Odyssey G5 (Testbericht), der AOC Gaming CQ27G3SU (Testbericht) und AOC Agon AG275QX (Testbericht) sowie KTC H27T22 (Testbericht) mit 165 Hertz.\nGibt es auch mobile Monitore zum Zocken?\nF\u00fcr die Zock-Sessions bei den Kumpels ist der eigene Gaming-Monitor zu schwer und unhandlich f\u00fcr den Transport. Hier bieten sich mobile oder auch portable Monitore an. Sie sehen aus wie ein Tablet und sind inzwischen mit \u00fcber 18 Zoll erh\u00e4ltlich. Bereits f\u00fcr rund 200 Euro bekommt man hier Modelle mit WQHD, kurzer Reaktionszeit von 1 ms und Bildwiederholfrequenzen von \u00fcber 144 Hertz.

This is now possible with Copilot extensions. And today I\u2019ll demonstrate the experience with Copilot extensions and how to build them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-First, let me unpack how Copilot for Microsoft 365 works in relation to Copilot extensions. Copilot for Microsoft 365 comprises large language models, information in the Microsoft Graph to find or reference files and data in places like SharePoint, OneDrive, email, your calendar, and Teams, along with information found on the internet to personalize the Copilot experience inside the Microsoft 365 apps you use.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-For example, when you submit a prompt in Word, Copilot determines what you are trying to do, finds additional information to ground your prompt, and then returns a fully formatted, highly personalized response to you. This is what sets Copilot for Microsoft 365 apart from free generative AI experiences.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-Copilot extensions enrich and focus this already great baseline experience further. There are a few main types. The first lets you plug into information sources relevant to you that are sitting outside of Microsoft 365 in near real time, and you can interact with them, like confirming a task was completed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-This is made possible by available plugins. You can also use connectors to extend what the Microsoft Graph indexes to sites or services also outside of Microsoft 365. The next lets you build your own Copilot, focused on a specific task requiring a specific set of files or data to guide it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-You can also add additional instructions and workflow to scope what it generates and even automate specific actions. This specialized Copilot is then made available as a Copilot extension for others to use. Let me make this real by walking through how Copilot extensions customize your experience with Copilot for Microsoft 365.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-In this example, I\u2019m a support technician. And one of the things I regularly have to do is write a weekly report detailing the support cases that I\u2019ve worked on. I\u2019m in Copilot for Microsoft Teams, and I\u2019ll first start with my baseline Copilot experience without extensions. I\u2019ll write a prompt to find all the emails I sent today and group them by topic.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-And that finds me all of the emails I was looking for and groups them like I asked. I now want to go beyond Microsoft 365 data and include information and knowledge base articles outside of it that are on our support site. I\u2019ll show you the enriched experience with my Copilot extension first, and then explain what\u2019s going on under the covers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-I\u2019ll use a different session, and paste in, \u201cSummarize all the emails I sent today, group them by high level topic. For each topic, find the support wiki article that is most related.\u201d And KB articles will come from the connected site. Once the entire response is generated, I can see the matching KB articles for each topic. And if I look at the citations, these ones are the sources using my Graph connected site.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-Here, my Copilot extension is using a Microsoft Graph connector to find information from the external sources that are connected to the Microsoft Graph. Next, I\u2019ll use a different Copilot extension that can also perform actions with an external system on my behalf. My IT team has enabled a plugin called Doc Improvement.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-In this prompt from yesterday, I\u2019ll paste create a doc improvement task to improve that first KB article based on the related emails I sent. This doesn\u2019t need all of the detail from the previous prompt because Copilot gets that information from the chat history in this session. And this extension actually writes back to another system and creates a task for a content writer to update one of our KB support articles.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-After I confirm, I see a confirmation that it has created the doc improvement work item. So far I\u2019ve shown how by using Copilot extensions, my experience as a technician was tailored with content specific to me, while enabling dynamic connections to external data and creating a ticket in my knowledge base system. Now let\u2019s look at how I can go further by focusing in on a specific task with a specialized Copilot available as a Copilot extension.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-This is our support content author Copilot, which my team has built to help us keep our knowledge base articles up to date. You can see that it has a few suggested prompts for skills or frequent tasks. I\u2019ll paste in update the Wiki article about remote help to add a first step of making sure that the user has logged in. This will first find the correct KB article, get its contents, understand where to insert the text, and then ask me to confirm.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-I can also suggest a modification, but let me type, go ahead, and let Copilot make the update. And one more thing I\u2019ll show you is how you can have multiple custom Copilots work together in the same conversation. I\u2019ll go back to the session I had with Copilot earlier. This time, I will at mention the support content author Copilot with a similar prompt.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-This performs the same job, but keeps me in this same session. Now, I\u2019ll at mention another custom Copilot that my team has written called Support Report Writer. Because it is being used in the same session, it has Microsoft Copilot\u2019s analysis of my email, as well as information about the KB article I just updated.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-Then after it\u2019s finished, you\u2019ll see that I now have a fully written draft report that I can copy into an email or a document, and make any additional changes. So, that\u2019s how Copilot extensions work. To build them, you can choose a low-code approach with Microsoft Copilot Studio, or an IDE like Visual Studio. Let\u2019s start with the low-code approach to build your own Copilot. You can get to Copilot Studio by going to copilotstudio.microsoft.com.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-From the Copilots tab, I just need to add a Copilot. And I can either use a prompt to describe the Copilot I want to build, or I can skip right to the configuration, which I\u2019ll do in this case. First, I need to give it a name, so I\u2019ll type in \u201cSupport Report Writer.\u201d For description, I\u2019ve enabled clipboard history here, so I\u2019ll paste in the text to describe my Copilot. Next, instructions, give your Copilot more context about its purpose and how to respond. You can get very specific with these instructions using natural language.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-Here I\u2019ve pasted in about 600 characters, but these can be up to 8,000 characters. Starter prompts like we saw before in our custom Copilot can also be added for frequent tasks and to help new users quickly get started. These are optional, and I\u2019ll skip this step to save a little time. From there, I just need to hit create.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-Once complete, I can make it available to the right users and groups by publishing it. Next, you can plug into other data, which can be external to, or inside of Microsoft 365. In the Copilot from Microsoft 365 page, you can see that I already have a few actions, including a few that point to a specific SharePoint locations for content. I\u2019ll add an action.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-Here, I can choose between a connector to link to the data I want, conversation to link to an existing solution, a prompt to link to a standard reusable prompt, and a flow containing workflow automation. I\u2019ll choose a conversation in my case. Now, I\u2019ll give it a name, \u201cSupport KB Docs Improvement.\u201d I\u2019ll leave the default solution, and you\u2019ll see that the schema name updates itself automatically.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-Then I\u2019ll hit create. And if you prefer to use an IDE like Visual Studio Code, let me show you the experience with the Microsoft Teams toolkit installed. I\u2019ll start with the plugin this time. You\u2019ll see that I have three basic JSON files open in my tabs. Swagger that JSON to connect to my API using specified operations and responses to send back when it succeeds or fails. Supportplugin.JSON describes the actions to take for users and gives more information for the model to use. Below that, the functions are defined to perform tasks.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-Then in runtimes, it points back to the swagger file and what functions are defined there. Finally, the manifest.JSON, which includes a bit more metadata including the ID, naming, developer, description, and branding details. Importantly, you\u2019ll see that in the manifest, I\u2019ve also defined declarative Copilots. In my case, the content Copilot I showed you earlier. So let\u2019s jump into that JSON file to show you how to build a Copilot.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-You\u2019ll see that this file contains essentially the same elements that we saw in Copilot Studio. Things like the name, ID, and description. The instructions, again, to provide more context for your custom Copilot. We\u2019ve also defined capabilities, which point to our Graph connector data. Actions for a plugin that points to our open API specification, and there are also conversation starters as suggested prompts with details about what those should do.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n-And with that, you can get started building Copilot extensions for more tailored experiences, capable of specialized tasks with the data you specify, even if it sits outside of Microsoft 365. These capabilities will be rolling out in the coming weeks. To learn more and get started, check out copilotstudio.microsoft.com.

Here\u2019s a seamless loop illustrating CBC-mode encryption:\nHere\u2019s a clip showing a code block being rewritten to avoid leaking padding information in error messages:\nHere\u2019s an illustration of a block cipher operating in CTS mode:\nYou may be surprised to learn that each of these illustrations was generated from \u226430 lines of code (30, 9, and 23 lines, respectively), without any golfing. The exact code used can be seen in the Cranim example gallery, along with many other examples of what this toolkit can do.\nBut let\u2019s take a step back. You may be familiar with the Cryptopals Guided Tour. These longform videos discuss various topics from cryptography, loosely following the path laid out by the cyptopals challenges, and starting with set 2 I began to bring in custom-made visual aids to support discussion as the concepts involved grew more abstract.\nTo create these visuals, the tool I reached for was Manim, a math visualization library best known for its use in 3Blue1Brown\u2018s videos (in fact, he is also Manim\u2019s original author). But while this library is very powerful (seriously, check out their example gallery), it is biased towards math, not computer science. It lacks support for such basic tasks as visualizing (or rewriting) a buffer; drawing a wire diagram; modifying a code snippet; and so on. To adapt this library to my use case, I had to write an extensive plugin adding all this functionality and more. Today I am releasing this plugin, cranim, in the hope that it will be useful to other computer science educators. You can find installation and usage guidelines in the GitHub repo: https://github.com/nccgroup/manim-cranim\nThe default color scheme is optimized for accessibility; contrast between colors should be clear even to colorblind viewers. This color palette was originally published for use by data scientists in multicolor figures. The default background color, a warm and pleasant off-white, is similarly meant to promote legibility: studies have shown that dark text on light backgrounds scans faster and more accurately than the inverse. The precise tone of the background is intended to evoke a poorly-cleaned whiteboard, a familiar sight to any computer science student.\nWhile the toolkit is oriented towards animations, Manim is equally capable of producing static images such as the illustration of CTS mode above; in cases where vector graphics are preferred, Manim can both consume and produce SVG files. The subset of Manim used by Cranim exclusively uses vector representations internally, making it a good fit for this use case.\nCranim is still under active development (as is the Guided Tour), so I have not yet written API docs; they will come as the API stabilizes. However, I keep the Example Gallery up to date, so you can turn to it for simple examples of idiomatic usage. If you\u2019re interested in a less trivial example, the full source code for the animations used in the 17th Guided Tour video can be found in this gist (though note that parts of it are hacky, as it was written quickly and has not been reviewed or edited; in this sense it closely models the sort of code the average Cranim user might write).\nIf you make something with Cranim, please feel free to send it my way! I\u2019m curious to see what uses people find for this tool, and I\u2019m happy to take feature requests (or bug reports) on GitHub as well.", "hash": "c5ea646f3852602a8f3f9357cf11baefe026c01dc1703370f87b70efa0edeb50", "id": "14b0838d-40f1-4998-947b-3afd68ecb2a7", "link": "https://research.nccgroup.com/2024/05/24/cranim-a-toolkit-for-cryptographic-visualization/", "osint_source_id": "9333b758-ed3b-42b5-b1a0-829be3fcd4bd", "published": "2024-05-24T19:30:00", "source": "https://research.nccgroup.com/feed/", "story_id": "6090d974-5210-4dd0-bd7c-a7d5983d6bc3", "title": "Cranim: A Toolkit for Cryptographic Visualization"}], "tags": {"3Blue1Brown": {"name": "3Blue1Brown", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "CBC-mode": {"name": "CBC-mode", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "CTS": {"name": "CTS", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Cranim": {"name": "Cranim", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Guided Tour": {"name": "Guided Tour", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Manim": {"name": "Manim", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "Cranim: A Toolkit for Cryptographic Visualization"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-25T17:15:29.014725", "id": "63141ca6-25b7-4171-b557-e0ff78e27d8a", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "12"}, {"created": "2024-05-25T17:11:23.411715", "id": "fceeda02-dad8-4753-8ce5-bdedeab253f9", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "4"}], "created": "2024-05-24T19:21:20", "id": "c15f589c-4856-4334-8de5-25469736519e", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Ascension slowly restoring network as nurses, doctors cite real-world dangers of attack\nCatholic hospital network Ascension said it expects to make progress in recovering from a ransomware attack by the end of the Memorial Day weekend.\nThe nonprofit\u2019s more than 140 hospitals and senior care centers have struggled to distribute medication, handle test results and intake emergency cases for more than two weeks following a devastating cyberattack by the Black Basta ransomware gang.\nOn Friday, an Ascension spokesperson said in a statement that they are \u201chopeful that after the weekend, our patients and clinicians will see progress across our points of care.\u201d\n\u201cMany of our vendors and partners have also started the process of reconnecting to our network and resuming services with Ascension, which should help to accelerate our overall recovery,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cUntil that time, please know that our hospitals and facilities remain open and are providing care.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the hospital network said it held the first of several regular meetings with partners and vendors as they slowly restore connections that were severed by the attack \u2014 which took electronic record systems offline and forced doctors and nurses to handle most taks through other means.\nAscension said it continues to work with Mandiant and other cybersecurity experts in the private sector and government to \u201crebuild and restore\u201d systems.\nThey provided specific webpages for hospitals in each state, allowing residents to see what the current status of most facilities currently is.\n'We are just waiting'\nLocal news outlets in dozens of states have spoken to nurses and doctors exasperated by the sudden loss of technology.\nOne nurse at a Michigan hospital called the situation \u201cso dangerous\u201d and told the Detroit Free Press that they have to use fax machines to order prescriptions, lab work and imaging.\n\"We are waiting four hours for head CT (scan) results on somebody having a stroke or a brain bleed,\" one nurse at Detroit\u2019s Ascension St. John Hospital told the newspaper. \"We are just waiting.

Today we are taking on Challenge 17, the famous padding oracle attack.\nFor those who don\u2019t know, Cryptopals is a series of eight sets of challenges covering common cryptographic constructs and common attacks on them. You can read more about Cryptopals at https://cryptopals.com/.\nThere\u2019s a lot of practical knowledge wrapped up in these challenges, and working through them is an excellent way for programmers to learn more about cryptography \u2013 or for cryptographers to learn more about programming. We strongly encourage you to give them a try and to see how far you can get on your own.\nThe Guided Tour is here for you to check your work after completing a challenge, or to see how else you might\u2019ve solved it \u2013 or for when you get stuck, can\u2019t get yourself unstuck, and are looking for a nudge in the right direction. We strongly encourage you to try \u201clearning by doing\u201d before watching the videos. You\u2019ll get more out of them that way!\nThese problems are complex, and if you take the shortest path to the solution, you\u2019re sure to miss a lot of the sights along the way. It can be hard to know what you\u2019re missing or where to look for it; that\u2019s where these videos come in. From the start, we\u2019ve prioritized detailed discussion; for set 2, we augmented these discussions with detailed animations showing exactly what\u2019s going on under the hood for each attack; for set 3, we\u2019re maintaining these high production values, integrating more research, and open-sourcing the tool used to generate these animations: cranim, a powerful toolkit for cryptographic (and generic computer science) animations with an emphasis on visualizing buffers and data flows. Cranim was developed to support the Guided Tour but is built with flexibility in mind; I hope that other educators will find it useful.\nWe\u2019re also accelerating the release schedule, favoring individual video releases over dropping an entire set at once. When videos take this long to make, it only makes sense to release them as soon as they\u2019re ready.\nIf you\u2019re just joining the Guided Tour, here\u2019s a playlist of the full series so far. Each video comes with a timestamped index of content so you can skip around as desired. Check the video descriptions, too; most of them also contain lists of links for further reading.\nAnd now, at long last, here is the next installment of the Cryptopals Guided Tour. We hope you find this helpful and educational, and we look forward to bringing the next videos to you as soon as they\u2019re ready.\nSet 3, Challenge 17: The CBC padding oracle\nDirect video link: https://youtu.be/6yHM19rQjDo\nChallenge link: https://cryptopals.com/sets/3/challenges/17\n00:00 \u2013 Intro\n00:53 \u2013 Big-picture view\n01:47 \u2013 Padding oracles in the wild\n02:33 \u2013 What happens if we provide an invalid token?\n03:33 \u2013 Ruining a developer\u2019s night\n05:53 \u2013 Let\u2019s take a look at the attack\n06:48 \u2013 Single block case\n09:02 \u2013 Confirming padding has length 1\n09:28 \u2013 XOR algebra, and the full search\n10:57 \u2013 Multi-block case\n11:53 \u2013 How can you prevent this attack?\n13:20 \u2013 Timing side-channels\n16:57 \u2013 Bolting a MAC onto it\n17:45 \u2013 Note on deniability\n18:10 \u2013 MACing ciphertext vs MACing plaintext\n19:55 \u2013 Recapping layers of defense\n20:13 \u2013 Breaking each layer of defense\n21:03 \u2013 As our side channel gets less reliable, how does the attack change?\n22:28 \u2013 Tracking confidences\n24:00 \u2013 False negatives and false positives\n25:12 \u2013 Bayes\u2019 Theorem\n26:42 \u2013 Entropy\n27:25 \u2013 Adding chart for expected informtion gained\n28:14 \u2013 Heuristics\n31:15 \u2013 Getting into trouble with MACs\n33:00 \u2013 Time to write some code!\n35:44 \u2013 Obligatory CSPRNG disclaimer\n36:50 \u2013 Sketching out the script\u2019s functions\n39:30 \u2013 Implementing the multi-block case\n40:43 \u2013 Implementing the easy functions\n42:18 \u2013 Implementing the single-block case\n49:10 \u2013 Testing the solution\n49:49 \u2013 \u201cI could just call it done here, but\u2026\u201d\n51:40 \u2013 Reading the plaintext\n52:27 \u2013 Implementing the noisy oracle case and signing off\nFurther reading:\nhttps://redis.io/blog/json-web-tokens-jwt-are-dangerous-for-user-sessions/\nhttps://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt\nhttps://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/algorithm-confusion\nhttps://fly.io/blog/api-tokens-a-tedious-survey/\nhttps://securitycryptographywhatever.buzzsprout.com/1822302/9020991-what-do-we-do-about-jwt-feat-jonathan-rudenberg\n(all of the above are just on JWTs, per the note at 02:33)\nhttps://youtu.be/sthXs4zJ5XU?t=5498\nhttps://iacr.org/submit/files/slides/2023/rwc/rwc2023/72/slides.pdf\nhttps://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/202/should-we-mac-then-encrypt-or-encrypt-then-mac\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC-MAC\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-record_messaging\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_cryptanalysis\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_analysis\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking\nhttps://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/75371/how-are-side-channel-attacks-executed-what-does-an-attacker-need-to-execute-a-s\nhttps://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/van-goethem\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1441 (\u201cWe were able to detect side channels of single-digit CPU cycles over regular gigabit Ethernet.\u201d)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGCoVF3YvM\nhttps://research.nccgroup.com/2021/02/17/cryptopals-exploiting-cbc-padding-oracles/\nhttps://research.nccgroup.com/2023/06/23/exploiting-noisy-oracles-with-bayesian-inference/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory#Entropy_of_an_information_source\nThank you!\nBefore wrapping up this post, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank Gerald Doussot and Javed Samuel for their continued patience, encouragement, and support with this very large undertaking.

In 2010, ICQ was purchased by Mail.ru (now VK), who has since owned the products as it declined in use.\nToday, ICQ announced that they are shutting down on June 26th, recommending that users switch to VK Messenger and Workspace.\nICQ has not shared why they are shutting down, and BleepingComputer emailed VK to learn more, but a response was not immediately available.\nHowever, this marks the end of a software that many have not used for years, but brings back a lot good memories.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

It is distinct from the IDOR previously discovered by Jo Coscia, and makes it trivial to actually obtain captures from other devices,\" Daigle said.\n\"Unfortunately, PCTattletale have ignored Zack and I's attempts at contacting them to fix the issue, so I can't give any more details here to avoid encouraging abuse of the vulnerability. Hopefully the stalkerware author(s) can be bothered to fix the issue soon, at which point I can give a full writeup.\"\nIn a YouTube video from seven years ago, pcTattletale's developer Bryan Fleming describes it as \"Spy Software\" while introducing its first Android test version.\n\"Download a free trial and put it on your Windows Home PC and watch how it works. It's pretty amazing how it does a recording of keystrokes and you can see anything your kids are doing on the computer or your employees,\" Fleming says in the video.\nWhile he describes it as spy software, Microsoft tracks pcTattletale as a threat and says it \"watches what you do on your PC, usually by recording your keystrokes or screen images\" and it \"tries to steal your sensitive and confidential information.\"\nDaigle's attempts to contact the developers to fix the security flaw failed, and the vulnerability still allows access to sensitive information belonging to users stalked using the pcTattletale spyware.\nWhile the security researcher only shared a limited amount of info regarding this severe flaw, someone took it as a challenge, defacing the spyware's website and leaking 20 archives containing source code and data dumped from pcTattletale's databases.\nHowever, as the hacker says on the now-defaced website, he didn't exploit the vulnerability Daigle found. Instead, he claims he used a Python exploit to extract pcTattletale's AWS credentials via its SOAP-based API, which provided access to the spyware's source code and databases.\nBleepingComputer reached out to Fleming with further questions, but a response was not immediately available.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

Weil: Gleich werde ich mit meinem Fahrrad gegen ein Auto antreten. Also ganz ehrlich, kein Witz, das wird gleich passieren. Ich wei\u00df noch nicht, wie es ausgeht. Ich habe auf jeden Fall hier schon meine Rad-Lycra-Hosentr\u00e4ger-Radhose an. Ja, und das Ganze findet in Hannover statt, vom Heise Hauptquartier in der Karl-Wiechert-Allee 10.\nJa, ach so, ach so, das hat jetzt gar nichts mit unseren normalen Technik-Themen, die wir hier auf dem Channel machen, zu tun?

Ich hatte zuerst die Idee, zum Lister Platz zu fahren, weil das a), nur etwas mehr als 5 Kilometer sind und b) weil es da wirklich schwierig ist, einen Parkplatz zu finden, vor allem zur Rush-Hour. Ich muss n\u00e4mlich zugeben, dass ich das schon ein bisschen fies f\u00fcr meine Schwester gestalten wollte.

Weil das sind halt acht Kilometer, was echt viel ist. Und es inzwischen fast 18 Uhr war, was wenig Verkehr bedeutet. Und wenig Verkehr ist schlecht f\u00fcr mich, weil ich halt wei\u00df, dass meine Schwester unnormal schnell f\u00e4hrt. Ja, okay, wir lassen das einfach mal drauf ankommen:\nAuf die Pl\u00e4tze.

Aber Navi-Apps schicken mich da gerne auf so schreckliche Bundesstra\u00dfen, wo man dann stundenlang wenige Zentimeter entfernt von Autos \u00fcberholt wird.

Die Verwaltung der Institution informierte bis zu 9000 aktuelle und vormalige Mitarbeiter von Abgeordneten am 6. Mai, dass es bereits Anfang des Jahres ein Leck im Einstellungs- und Personalmanagementsystem \"People\" gegeben habe. Anfangs war in der E-Mail, die der zust\u00e4ndige Generaldirektor Kristian Knudsen versandte, nur von pers\u00f6nlichen Informationen die Rede, die betroffen sein k\u00f6nnten. Jetzt ist bekannt geworden, dass zu den kompromittierten Daten etwa Strafregisterausz\u00fcge, Krankenakten, Arbeitsnachweise der vergangenen zehn Jahre, Anspr\u00fcche auf soziale Leistungen und zu Versicherungen geh\u00f6rten. Die betroffenen Dokumente beziehen sich auch auf Personenstand, Wohnsitz und weitere Daten aus Ausweisen und Reisep\u00e4ssen, milit\u00e4rische Verpflichtungen, Geburtsurkunden sowie Schulabschl\u00fcsse.\nNach einer ersten Analyse seien allen aktiven und inaktiven \"People\"-Nutzer am 22. Mai detaillierte Informationen gem\u00e4\u00df einer Empfehlung des EU-Datenschutzbeauftragten Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt worden, erkl\u00e4rte ein Parlamentssprecher gegen\u00fcber dem Portal Euractiv. Dem Bericht zufolge waren fast alle hochgeladenen Dokumente betroffen. Es ist nach wie vor unklar, ob der Datenschutzversto\u00df auf einen Cyberangriff oder eine andere Sicherheitsl\u00fccke zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren ist. Wie viele Personen zu den Opfern z\u00e4hlen, ist \u00f6ffentlich nicht bekannt. Wiewi\u00f3rowski und die Polizei ermitteln in dem Fall noch und versuchen, die genauen Umst\u00e4nde zu kl\u00e4ren.\nGro\u00dfer Unmut \u00fcber unzureichende Informationspolitik\nDie betroffene Anwendung wurde nach der Datenpanne deaktiviert. Die Verwaltung riet den Mitarbeitern, Passw\u00f6rter zur\u00fcckzusetzen und bei verd\u00e4chtigen Nachrichten vorsichtig zu sein. Das System werde gesichert und im Anschluss bald wieder online gehen, hie\u00df es laut Euractiv in der j\u00fcngsten Mail. Doch der Unmut der Betroffenen w\u00e4chst. Nach Informationen des Online-Dienstes Politico Playbook hat der Ausschuss f\u00fcr akkreditierte parlamentarische Assistenten (APA), der rund 2000 Angestellte vertritt, Parlamentspr\u00e4sidentin Roberta Metsola und hochrangige Beamte um Aufkl\u00e4rung gebeten. Das Gremium wolle etwa wissen, welche Schritte das Management unternommen habe, um die Datenschutz- und Cybersicherheitsrisiken zu entsch\u00e4rfen, die sich aus dem Versto\u00df ergeben.\n\"Die Leute sind extrem ver\u00e4rgert, w\u00e4hrend von der anderen Seite nur zwei E-Mails von einer gesichtslosen Generaldirektion kommen\", beklagte Stefan De Koning, Mitarbeiter der niederl\u00e4ndischen liberalen Abgeordneten Sophie in \u2019t Veld, gegen\u00fcber Playbook. \"Keine Anweisungen, Entschuldigungen, Hinweise jeglicher Art.\" D\u00e1vid Kardos, Assistent der Parlamentarierinnen Anna Don\u00e1th und Katalin Cseh, monierte laut Euractiv gegen\u00fcber dem APA: \"Unsere Identit\u00e4ten k\u00f6nnen prinzipiell gestohlen und unsere Daten missbraucht werden.\"\nKardos stellt demnach auch die versp\u00e4tete Benachrichtigung \u00fcber das im Januar aufgetretene Leck in Frage und fragte nach laufenden Ermittlungen und potenziellen Verd\u00e4chtigen. Die aktuelle Legislaturperiode sei ja bereits vorbei. Es m\u00fcsse auch gekl\u00e4rt werden, ob die M\u00f6glichkeit einer Beteiligung von Drittstaaten an dem Vorfall bestehe. Der APA zeigte sich ebenfalls entt\u00e4uscht \u00fcber den Informationsfluss nach dem Datenabfluss. Es gebe nicht mal eine Empfehlung, ob Betroffene Ausweisdokumente erneuern oder wie sie mit unver\u00e4nderbaren pers\u00f6nlichen Merkmalen umgehen sollten. Im Februar war bereits bekannt geworden, dass Mitglieder des Verteidigungsausschusses des Parlaments Opfer von Cyberattacken auf ihre Mobiltelefone geworden waren.\n(mki)", "hash": "9aba8dbdd785e8b8786ecb21e9093b7d7ee40fcb9a6a6f8cfb60772ca9b5d79a", "id": "deace9a8-9dcd-4018-87a2-2670f9498b65", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Datenschutzpanne-im-EU-Parlament-Leck-umfasst-Strafregister-und-Reisepaesse-9731688.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-24T17:47:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "65a1d3d6-1c78-4ebe-8ad2-eeba542b50c6", "title": "Datenschutzpanne im EU-Parlament: Leck umfasst Strafregister und Reisep\u00e4sse\u200b"}], "tags": {"APA": {"name": "APA", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Anna Don\u00e1th": {"name": "Anna Don\u00e1th", "tag_type": "PER"}, "D\u00e1vid Kardos": {"name": "D\u00e1vid Kardos", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Euractiv": {"name": "Euractiv", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Kardos": {"name": "Kardos", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Katalin Cseh": {"name": "Katalin Cseh", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Kristian Knudsen": {"name": "Kristian Knudsen", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Roberta Metsola": {"name": "Roberta Metsola", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Sophie": {"name": "Sophie", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Stefan De Koning": {"name": "Stefan De Koning", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Wiewi\u00f3rowski": {"name": "Wiewi\u00f3rowski", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski": {"name": "Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Datenschutzpanne im EU-Parlament: Leck umfasst Strafregister und Reisep\u00e4sse\u200b"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-25T01:27:53.990654", "id": "adb59dda-c2b3-4065-b666-348642375cca", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "5"}, {"created": "2024-05-25T01:12:15.352582", "id": "cdd4d622-dcd2-49ca-89d0-d4e308a1cf53", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "0"}], "created": "2024-05-24T17:20:00", "id": "055d6c12-97c2-42fe-84cd-cf8277b07e48", "news_items": [{"author": "msmash", "content": "Messaging Service ICQ To Shut Down Next Month After Nearly 30 Years (icq.com) 58\nICQ, a once-popular IM, is shutting down on June 26, it says on its website.

Die Firma torpediere Versuche, Ger\u00e4te reparaturfreundlicher zu machen.\nSamsung hat offenbar kaum Interesse, die Reparaturfreundlichkeit seiner Smartphones, Tablets und Notebooks zu verbessern, um Nutzern Reparaturen zu erleichtern. iFixit hat nach zwei Jahren eine Kooperation mit Samsung beendet, weil die Firma zu stur sein soll.\n\"Als wir versuchten, dieses \u00d6kosystem aufzubauen, stie\u00dfen wir immer wieder auf Hindernisse, die uns an Samsungs Engagement f\u00fcr eine bessere Zug\u00e4nglichkeit von Reparaturen zweifeln lie\u00dfen\", schreibt iFixit in der Bekanntgabe. \"Wir haben versucht, das Ganze zum Laufen zu bringen. Meine G\u00fcte, wir haben es versucht. Aber bei so unterschiedlichen Priorit\u00e4ten sind wir nicht mehr in der Lage weiterzumachen.\"\nSamsung gegen Reparaturen\nZum einen soll Samsung von iFixit keine Verbesserungsvorschl\u00e4ge f\u00fcr seine Smartphones angenommen haben, etwa den Einsatz von Kleber zu verringern. Zum anderen soll Samsung die Versorgung von offiziellen Ersatzteilen torpediert haben.\nDemnach hat Samsung zum Beispiel keine einzelnen Akkus f\u00fcr Galaxy-Smartphones an iFixit verkaufen wollen, sondern nur zusammengeklebte Einheiten aus Display und Akku. Wer nur einen schlappen Akku austauschen wollte, musste bei iFixit unn\u00f6tig viel Geld f\u00fcr ein zus\u00e4tzliches Display ausgeben. F\u00fcr die letzten beiden Galaxy-Generation S23 und S24 hat iFixit gar keine Ersatzteile mehr von Samsung bekommen.\nZudem soll Samsung den Verkauf von Ersatzteilen massiv eingeschr\u00e4nkt haben, auf nur sieben St\u00fcck alle drei Monate pro Kunde. F\u00fcr Endnutzer, die direkt bei iFixit bestellen, ist das kaum ein Problem. Allerdings versorgt iFixit auch Reparaturshops mit Ersatzteilen, was bei Samsung-Ger\u00e4ten nicht im ausreichenden Umfang m\u00f6glich war.\nKnebelvertr\u00e4ge\n404 Media erhebt noch schwerere Vorw\u00fcrfe gegen Samsung. Demnach m\u00fcssen Reparaturshops einen fragw\u00fcrdigen Vertrag unterschreiben, um offizielle Ersatzteile zu erhalten. Der Vertrag soll die Shops verpflichten, umfangreiche Daten zu allen Reparaturen an Samsung zu schicken, darunter den Vollnamen, die Adressen, E-Mail-Adressen und Telefonnummern aller Kunden, zuz\u00fcglich Details zur vorgenommenen Reparatur und im Falle von Smartphones der einzigartigen IMEI-Nummer (International Mobile Equipment Identity).\nGeht das noch nicht weit genug, soll Samsung die Shops verpflichtet haben, Ger\u00e4te komplett zu zerlegen, anstatt zu reparieren, wenn sie darin nachgebaute Ersatzteile dritter Hersteller vorfinden, und Samsung dar\u00fcber zu informieren. Unklar ist, ob das nur den US-Markt oder auch Europa betreffen soll und ob iFixit diesen Vertrag ebenfalls unterschreiben musste.\niFixit bietet jetzt wieder Ersatzteile von Drittherstellern f\u00fcr Samsung-Ger\u00e4te an. Damit wird auch die Versorgungslage von Reparaturshops verbessert. Samsung arbeitet derweil mit dem Reparaturspezialisten Encompass weiter \u2013 zumindest in Nordamerika.

Als Internet-Meme ging das Konterfei des Shiba-Hundes jedenfalls um die Welt, sp\u00e4ter wurde der Hund sogar das Symbol f\u00fcr die Spa\u00df-Kryptow\u00e4hrung \u201eDogecoin\u201c.\nAm Freitag ist der Hund im Alter von 18 Jahren verstorben, wie ihre Besitzerin auf Instagram mitteilte \u2013 und mit ihr trauert das gesamte Internet. Denn wohl kaum ein Hund steht so stark f\u00fcr die Internetkultur der 2010er Jahre, wie der \u201eDoge\u201c.\nBesitzerin postete merkw\u00fcrdiges Foto ihrer H\u00fcndin\nDie H\u00fcndin Kabosu wurde am 1. November 2005 geboren und 2008 von einer japanischen Kinderg\u00e4rtnerin namens Atsuko Sato adoptiert. Die Ursache f\u00fcr den Tod des ber\u00fchmten Internet-Hundes war eine Leuk\u00e4mie-Erkrankung, an der das Tier seit 2 Jahren litt.\nDamals hatte die Frau ein eigenes Blog, auf dem sie regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Bilder von ihren Haustieren ver\u00f6ffentlichte. Irgendwann war darauf eine Aufnahme von Kabosu, die das Tier mit leicht zur Seite geneitgtem Kopf zeigt. Der Blick des Hundes ist fragend, ein bisschen so als wollte er zum Betrachter mit hochgezogenen Augenbrauen sagen: \"Was willst du eigentlich von mir?\"\nDieses Foto fand jedenfalls irgendwie den Weg in andere Kan\u00e4le. Im Laufe der Zeit wurde es zu einem viralen Internet-Meme, dass unz\u00e4hlige Male abgewandelt und geteilt wurde.\nDoge-Meme wurde 2013 popul\u00e4r\nDie ersten Memes mit dem Shiba tauchten um das Jahr 2013 auf Plattformen wie Tumblr und Reddit auf, es zeigt ein Bild des Tieres, das seinen Blick vom Foto etwas erschreckt abwendet. Oft wurden dar\u00fcber Texte mit der Schriftart Comic Sans platziert. Das Meme hatte stets eine \u00e4hnliche Strukur \u2013 das Bild des Hundes, dar\u00fcber Wortkombinationen, die \u201eso\u201c, \u201esuch\u201c, \u201emany\u201c, \u201emuch\u201c und \u201every\u201c enthielten.\nOft waren die Memes absichtlich ironisch und grammatisch falsch gestaltet. Die Bezeichnung \u201eDoge\u201c ist indessen noch \u00e4lter, wie Know Your Meme erkl\u00e4rt und stammt aus einer 2005 ver\u00f6ffentlichte Folge einer Puppenshow namens \u201eHomestar Runner\u201c. Das Meme-Format wurde dann zwar vor allem f\u00fcr Bilder von Kabosu verwendet, aber auch andere Hunde waren gelegentlich als Charaktere in den Memes zu sehen. Generell wurde \u201eDoge\u201c zu einem Synonym f\u00fcr seltsam dreinschauende Hunde im Internet.\nVon Kryptow\u00e4hrung bis Satellit\nIm Dezember 2013 wurde das Hundekonterfei sogar zum Vorbild f\u00fcr die Kryptow\u00e4hrung Dogecoin, die bis heute zahlreichen Fans hat. Die W\u00e4hrung wurde von 2 IBM-Software-Ingenieuren urspr\u00fcnglich als Gag geschaffen. Im Laufe der Zeit wurde sie dann immer wieder zum Gegenstand von Kontroversen. 2014 \u00fcberstieg das gehandelte Volumen der W\u00e4hrung kurzfristig sogar das aller anderen Kryptow\u00e4hrungen zusammen.\nElon Musk machte etwa regelm\u00e4\u00dfig Werbung f\u00fcr Dogecoin und wurde sogar von Investor*innen der Kryptow\u00e4hrung verklagt, die ihm vorwarfen, den Kurs der W\u00e4hrung durch Tweets absichtlich abst\u00fcrzen zu lassen. Bei Tesla kann man bis heute mit Dogecoin bezahlen. Sogar ein Satellit wurde nach dem Hunde-Meme benannt \u2013 der Start von Doge-1 wurde allerdings schon mehrmals verschoben, zuletzt im Februar 2024.\nFest steht: Die Shiba-H\u00fcndin Kabosu ist ein Teil Internetgeschichte und kann nicht so leicht vergessen werden. Ob das Tier selbst jemals von seiner Ber\u00fchmtheit mitbekommen hat, ist fraglich. Laut ihrem Instagram-Profil war sie bis ins hohe Alter ein freundlich schauender Hund, der wie die meisten ihrer Artgenossen gerne Zeit im Freien verbrachte und Streicheleinheiten genoss. Kabosu wird ihren 535.000 Follower*innen auf Instagram bestimmt fehlen.\nKommentare", "hash": "0c9239fc33fc9b4b6ee8e8d216cbea954b9dd87f8b27e9f3e36047a33b02e4a4", "id": "fd4aaba1-497d-4a73-abc3-f890678de75e", "link": "https://futurezone.at/digital-life/hund-dogecoin-gestorben-krypto-cryptowaehrung-shiba-inu-kabosu/402904406", "osint_source_id": "eec2ad26-2f4c-4dd8-a3e5-08c0eb3765ca", "published": "2024-05-24T16:24:30", "source": "https://futurezone.at/xml/rss", "story_id": "ef985e59-fca9-4aaa-a06d-408f9f6074e1", "title": "\"Much sad\": Der \"Doge\"-Hund ist gestorben"}], "tags": {"Atsuko Sato": {"name": "Atsuko Sato", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Dogecoin": {"name": "Dogecoin", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Kabosu": {"name": "Kabosu", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Meme-Format": {"name": "Meme-Format", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Shiba-Hundes": {"name": "Shiba-Hundes", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Tesla": {"name": "Tesla", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "\"Much sad\": Der \"Doge\"-Hund ist gestorben"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T17:26:47.446041", "id": "48ec8cf3-8702-4b77-b17d-f52554a3dfd9", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "7"}], "created": "2024-05-24T16:15:00", "id": "f78466e2-d7df-4fcf-b567-894884c7c5bd", "news_items": [{"author": "Lukasz Konieczny", "content": "Smartwatches sind l\u00e4ngst angekommen im mobilen Markt und erweitern und erg\u00e4nzen Handys um zus\u00e4tzliche Funktionen. Varianten mit eSIM und Mobilfunk sowie GPS sind sogar in der Lage, autark ohne Smartphone zu funktionieren. Das bietet sich an, wenn man die Uhr im Urlaub zum Bezahlen mitnehmen m\u00f6chte oder beim Joggen f\u00fcrs Tracking und zur Wiedergabe von Musik.\nUhren wie die aktuellen Modelle der Apple Watch (Testbericht) oder Samsung Galaxy Watch (Testbericht) sind zudem eng verzahnt mit dem Betriebssystem des Handys und erlauben auch das Beantworten von Nachrichten. Daneben halten sie eine Reihe von Vitalfunktionen fest. Eine Schwachstelle haben diese Wearables aber: Die Akkulaufzeit ist kaum l\u00e4nger als bei einem Smartphone, sodass die Ger\u00e4te in der Regel abends an die Steckdose m\u00fcssen.\nEine Alternative f\u00fcr alle, die die Uhr als Erg\u00e4nzung zum Smartphone nutzen m\u00f6chten, sind Smartwatches mit propriet\u00e4ren Betriebssystemen. Diese bieten eine Akkulaufzeit von fast zwei Wochen, messen den Puls, \u00fcberwachen den Schlaf, z\u00e4hlen Schritte und geben Benachrichtigen vom Smartphone weiter. Zu dieser Kategorie geh\u00f6rt die Huawei Watch Fit 3. Die dritte Generation der Smartwatch zeichnet sich durch ein schlankes und leichtes Geh\u00e4use aus. Die smarten Funktionen sind hingegen weniger ausgepr\u00e4gt, sodass es sich eher um einen luxuri\u00f6sen Fitness-Tracker handelt. Was die Smartwatch alles bietet, zeigt unser Testbericht.\nWeitere Uhren f\u00fcrs Training zeigen wir in der Top 10: Die besten Fitness-Tracker \u2013 Testsieger ist Xiaomi Smart Band 8 Pro sowie Top 10: Die besten Sportuhren \u2013 Smartwatches von Garmin, Polar, Amazfit & Co. Noch schlauere Wearables finden sich in der Top 10: Die besten Smartwatches \u2013 Apple Watch & Galaxy Watch sind Testsieger.\nWas sind die Highlights?\nIm Test \u00fcberzeugte die preiswerte, bequeme und dennoch schicke Uhr mit einem fairen Preis ab 159 Euro. Diese St\u00e4rken bietet die Watch Fit 3:\nhoher Tragekomfort im Alltag, beim Sport oder im Schlaf\n-\ngut ablesbares Display bei jedem Wetter\n-\nbeste Smartwatch in dieser Preisklasse\n-\nAkkulaufzeit von bis zu zehn Tagen macht die Uhr zur guten Erg\u00e4nzung zum Smartphone\n-\npr\u00e4zise Messung des Pulses\n-\nWas wiegt die Huawei Wacht Fit 3 und wie ist der Tragekomfort?\nDesign und Verarbeitung sind hervorragend, die Uhr \u00fcberzeugt vor allem mit einem schlanken und sehr leichten Geh\u00e4use, das nur 26 Gramm wiegt. Optisch erinnert die Watch Fit 3 etwas an die Apple Watch, was dem rechteckigen Geh\u00e4use geschuldet ist. Sie f\u00e4llt minimal kleiner und schlanker aus als die Uhr von Apple. Getestet haben wir das Modell mit grauem Nylonarmband.\nDie Bedingung erfolgt \u00fcber den Touchscreen sowie die Krone auf der rechten Seite. Eine programmierbare Taste ist ebenfalls vorhanden, die im Auslieferungszustand das Training startet. Sehr praktisch ist das flexible Nylonarmband mit Klettverschluss. Das An- und Abziehen der Uhr ist so sehr komfortabel. Dank des niedrigen Gewichts sp\u00fcrt man die Uhr kaum beim Tragen. Ebenfalls gut sitzen die Modelle mit Silikon- oder Lederarmband.\nWie hell ist das Display der Watch Fit 3?\nAbsolut \u00fcberzeugend ist der 1,82-Zoll-Bildschirm mit OLED-Panel. Huawei gibt eine sehr hohe Helligkeit von bis zu 1500 Nits an. In der Praxis f\u00fchrt das dazu, dass die Anzeige immer gut ablesbar ist \u2013 auch bei starkem Sonnenschein. Die Aufl\u00f6sung von 480 \u00d7 408 Pixel bietet ein ausreichend scharfes Bild, bei dem Pixel mit dem Auge so gut wie gar nicht zu erkennen sind. Bildqualit\u00e4t, Farben und Kontraste \u00fcberzeugen ebenfalls.\nWas bietet die App?\nWie \u00fcblich kommt die Health App von Huawei zum Einsatz. Hier stolpern Nutzer gleich \u00fcber die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Schw\u00e4che der Uhr: Aufgrund der Sanktionen ist die Anwendung zum Beispiel nicht im Google Play Store vorhanden. Eine Ausnahme sind die Smartphones von Samsung und Honor sowie das iPhone, bei der die App in den jeweiligen App-Stores der Hersteller zur Verf\u00fcgung steht.\nBei anderen Android-Ger\u00e4ten muss man die App per QR-Code mit dem Android-Smartphone aus einer externen Quelle installieren \u2013 wozu man dem Smartphone bei der Installation die Berechtigung erteilen muss. Das erfordert einiges Fachwissen. Nach der Installation sollte man diese Berechtigung sicherheitshalber wieder entfernen. Zur Einrichtung muss man die Uhr mit der App per Bluetooth koppeln und ein Konto bei Huawei erstellen oder sich mit einem schon bestehenden Zugang anmelden.\nDer Aufbau der App ist \u00fcbersichtlich. Oben im Health-Reiter finden sich wie gewohnt drei Kreise f\u00fcr Aktivit\u00e4ten (Bewegung, Trainieren, Stehen), die zeigen, wie weit man seine Tagesziele schon erreicht hat. Darunter folgen weitere Fenster mit Daten zu vergangenen Trainingseinheiten, Gesundheitsdaten wie Herzschlag oder Blutsauerstoff, Schlaf oder Stresslevel. Ferner gibt es einige Trainingspl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr etwa Laufen oder Krafttraining, einen Store mit Ziffernbl\u00e4ttern (teils kostenlos, teils geb\u00fchrenpflichtig) und diverse Einstellungsm\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr Benachrichtigungen der Uhr.\nDie App beinhaltet jetzt auch einen Kalorienz\u00e4hler, mit dem man die zu sich genommen Mahlzeiten festh\u00e4lt. Es gibt zudem die M\u00f6glichkeit, mithilfe der Uhr Intervallfasten zu betreiben. F\u00fcr weitere Auswertungen und eine erweiterte Schlafanalyse sowie zus\u00e4tzliche Trainings- und Ern\u00e4hrungs-Pl\u00e4ne k\u00f6nnen Nutzer ein Abonnement f\u00fcr Huawei Health Plus abschlie\u00dfen. Dieses kostet 8 Euro im Monat oder 60 Euro im Jahr. Mit dem Snack Assistant kann man den Barcode einer Verpackung fotografieren und bekommt dann die N\u00e4hrstoffwerte und Kalorien des Produkts geliefert. Der Stay Fit Plan gibt dem Nutzer dann Tipps, wie mit Sport und Ern\u00e4hrung per Wochenplan ein Kaloriendefizit erzeugt wird, um abzunehmen. Achtung: Dieses Verfahren eignet sich weniger, um etwa Muskeln aufzubauen.\nHuawei Watch Fit 3 - Health-App\nHuawei Watch Fit 3 - Health-App\nWas kann ich alles mit der Huawei Watch Fit 3 machen?\nDie Huawei Watch Fit 3 bietet optische Sensoren zur Pulsmessung. Der Blutsauerstoffwert kann von der Uhr nur gesch\u00e4tzt werden \u2013 entspricht also keiner medizinischen Untersuchung. Im Alltag z\u00e4hlt die Watch Fit 3 die t\u00e4glichen Schritte und berechnet den groben Kalorienverbrauch anhand der Aktivit\u00e4ten. Beim Sport erkennt sie zudem die maximale Sauerstoffaufnahme. Mangels H\u00f6henmessung kann die Watch Fit 3 jedoch keine Stockwerke z\u00e4hlen.\nAuf Wunsch \u00fcberwacht die Uhr zudem den Schlaf. Die App gibt dann die Dauer der einzelnen Schlafphasen an sowie die Qualit\u00e4t und Frequenz der Atmung. Leider erkennt sie im Test nicht alle Wachphasen zuverl\u00e4ssig, ein Problem, das wir von vielen anderen Smartwatches her kennen. Frauen k\u00f6nnen zudem auf eine Zyklus\u00fcberwachung zur\u00fcckgreifen. Die Huawei Watch Fit 3 ist zudem wasserdicht und kann beim Schwimmen getragen werden. Sitzt man f\u00fcr l\u00e4ngere Zeit, erinnert die Watch Fit 3 den Tr\u00e4ger automatisch daran, sich mal zu bewegen.\nWirklich smarte Funktionen und Anwendungen gibt es nur wenige. Dazu geh\u00f6ren lediglich ein Wetter-Widget, eine Stoppuhr- und Timer-Funktion sowie Musiksteuerung f\u00fcr die Ausgabe auf dem Smartphone. Die Installation von weiteren Apps ist nicht vorgesehen. Immerhin kann \u00fcber die App Musik auf die Uhr \u00fcbertragen werden, allerdings gibt es keinen Support f\u00fcr Dienste wie Spotify. Nachrichten k\u00f6nnen nur per Standardantworten oder Emojis beantwortet werden. Zum Telefonieren oder Bezahlen ist die Smartwatch ebenfalls nicht geeignet. Einen NFC-Sensor gibt es nur bei der Variante mit Nylon- und Lederarmband.\nWie ist das Training mit der Watch Fit 3?\nBeim Training entfaltet die Huawei Watch Fit 3 ihre wahren St\u00e4rken. Es stehen \u00fcber 100 verschiedene Profile zur Verf\u00fcgung. So kann die Uhr auch Schwimmz\u00fcge mit dem entsprechenden Trainingsprofil erkennen. Die Pulsmessung ist pr\u00e4zise f\u00fcr eine Uhr dieser Preisklasse, selbst bei starkem Wechsel der Belastung kommt die Uhr gut hinterher \u2013 auch wenn sie nicht ganz mit einem Pulsgurt mithalten kann. F\u00fcr Hobby-Sportler bietet sie aber gen\u00fcgend Pr\u00e4zision.\nDas Einzige, was uns wirklich genervt hat: Die Uhr ist beim Start des Trainings per Default auf laut gestellt und br\u00fcllt einen regelrecht an. Es ist zudem etwas umst\u00e4ndlich, die Ansagen dann leise zu stellen. Die automatische Trainingserkennung reagiert auch nicht immer oder wenn, recht tr\u00e4ge. Daf\u00fcr gef\u00e4llt die \u00dcbersucht der Daten beim Training mit der Darstellung des Herzschlags, der verbrauchten Kalorien, Dauer des Trainings und ob man sich im aeroben oder anaeroben Bereich befindet.\nHuawei Watch Fit 3 - Bilderstrecke\nHuawei Watch Fit 3\nWie lange h\u00e4lt der Akku?\nEine der gr\u00f6\u00dften St\u00e4rken ist die Akkulaufzeit \u2013 ein Vorteil, wenn die Uhr weniger smart ausf\u00e4llt. Huawei gibt hier bis zu 10 Tage an, was sich mit unseren Erfahrungen deckt. Wer h\u00e4ufiger das GPS nutzt, muss mit eher einer Woche rechnen.\nWas kostet die Huawei Watch Fit 3?\nDie UVP f\u00fcr die Variante mit Armband aus Fluorelastomer betr\u00e4gt 159 Euro. Erh\u00e4ltlich ist dieses Modell in den Farben Schwarz, Rosa, Gr\u00fcn und Wei\u00df. Mit dem Code AHWFIT3S gibt es direkt bei Huawei einen Rabatt von 19 Euro bis zum 07.06.2024. Die Kopfh\u00f6rer Huawei Freebuds SE 2 gibt es dann als Geschenk oben darauf.\nDas von uns getestete Modell mit grauem Nylonarmband und roter Krone ist ab dem 28.05.2024 f\u00fcr 159 Euro lieferbar. Die Variante mit goldenem Geh\u00e4use und wei\u00dfem Lederarmband hat eine Preisempfehlung von 179 Euro, ist derzeit aber schon f\u00fcr nur 156 Euro bei Gomibo vorbestellbar.\nAls Alternativen f\u00fcr sportliche Tr\u00e4ger bietet sich die ebenfalls preiswerte und \u00e4hnlich ausgestattete Amazfit Active (Testbericht) f\u00fcr 120 Euro an. Wer einen Fitness-Tracker mit EKG sucht, sollte sich die Fitbit Charge 6 (Testbericht) f\u00fcr 119 Euro ansehen. F\u00fcr Fans klassischer Uhren-Designs bietet sich zudem die Huawei Watch GT 4 (Testbericht) ab 198 Euro an.\nFazit\nDie Huawei Watch Fit 3 begeistert mit gutem Design, dem hohen Tragekomfort und niedrigem Gewicht.

Um eine neue Generation von KI-Anwendungen aber auch f\u00fcr jedermann \u00fcberall verf\u00fcgbar machen zu k\u00f6nnen, brauche es nicht nur neue Plattformen wie die angek\u00fcndigten KI-PCs, sondern Entwicklerinnen und Entwicklern m\u00fcssten auch geeignete Werkzeuge und Hilfsmittel zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen, um solche Applikationen zu bauen. Die Voraussetzungen daf\u00fcr will Microsoft nun auf Basis der Windows Copilot Runtime unter anderem mit der Windows Copilot Library sowie neuen Small Language Models (SLMs) aus der Phi-Serie schaffen \u2013 darunter Phi Silica.\nWindows Copilot Runtime als Plattform f\u00fcr offene KI-Entwicklung\nDie neue Windows Copilot Runtime soll das Fundament bilden, auf dem sich Windows als die \"offenste Plattform f\u00fcr KI-Entwicklung\" etabliert, wie Microsoft in seinem Developer-Blog ganz unbescheiden ank\u00fcndigt. Dazu setzt die Copilot Runtime einerseits auf neuer Hardware f\u00fcr die Copilot+-PCs mit Neural Processing Units (NPUs) auf, darunter beispielsweise Qualcomms Snapdragon-X-Serie mit ARM-Architektur. Passend dazu gibt es etwa das Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows. \u00dcber die integrierte Windows Copilot Library stehen Entwicklerinnen und Entwicklern eine Reihe von APIs offen. Sie sollen den Zugriff auf die mit Windows ausgelieferten KI-Modelle \u2013 Microsoft spricht von mehr als 40 Modellen \u2013 erm\u00f6glichen, die sich unmittelbar lokal auf dem Rechner nutzen lassen.\nDie \u00fcber das Windows App SDK zug\u00e4nglichen APIs decken derzeit Funktionsbereiche wie die neuen Studio Effects, Live-\u00dcbersetzungen, Texterkennung sowie die Suchfunktion Recall ab. Weitere APIs f\u00fcr Vector Embeddings, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) und Textzusammenfassungen sollen zu einem sp\u00e4teren Zeitpunkt folgen. Ab Juni soll aber das neue SLM Phi Silica bereitstehen, wenn voraussichtlich die ersten Copilot+-PCs damit in den Verkauf gehen. Das 3,3-Milliarden-Parameter-SLM aus der Phi-3-Serie ist speziell auf die NPUs in den KI-PCs ausgelegt. Phi Silica soll die Ausf\u00fchrung des KI-Algorithmus komplett lokal auf die NPU verlagern und sowohl CPU als auch GPU der neuen Systeme entlasten. Microsoft spricht von einer anf\u00e4nglichen Token-Latenz von 650 Token pro Sekunde \u2013 bei einem Leistungsbedarf von nur rund 1,5 Watt.\nDirectML f\u00fcr mehr KI-Vielfalt unter Windows\n\u00dcber die genannten KI-Modelle von Microsoft hinaus, erhalten Entwicklerinnen und Entwickler aber auch neue M\u00f6glichkeiten, auf Basis der einheitlichen Windows-API DirectML bestehende sowie eigene Modelle in KI-Applikationen einzubringen. Als Abstraktionsschicht erlaubt DirectML den Einsatz von KI-Modellen auf unterschiedlichen GPUs und NPUs (CPUs sollen folgen) und l\u00e4sst sich mit g\u00e4ngigen ML-Frameworks wie PyTorch, ONNX Runtime und WebNN nutzen. F\u00fcr PyTorch hat Microsoft nun sogar nativen Support unter Windows bekannt gegeben \u2013 zumindest auf GPUs. F\u00fcr NPUs will das Unternehmen ihn baldm\u00f6glichst nachliefern. Die zahlreichen auf Hugging Face zug\u00e4nglichen KI-Modelle lassen sich damit aber schon heute auch unter Windows verwenden.\nIm Hinblick auf den KI-Einsatz in Web-Applikationen k\u00f6nnen Entwicklerinnen und Entwickler ab sofort auf eine Developer-Preview von WebNN zur\u00fcckgreifen. Das World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) k\u00fcmmert sich derzeit um die Spezifizierung der Web Neural Network API (WebNN). In Verbindung mit DirectML und der ONNX Runtime Web soll sie das Ausf\u00fchren von ML-Modellen im Browser beschleunigen. Daf\u00fcr lassen sich derzeit bereits GPUs nutzen, Support f\u00fcr NPUs will Microsoft aber nachreichen.\n(map)", "hash": "809101952e5239b4e03a852d4f557084b5a881fbe1e3a23e45825446af8d2289", "id": "e8a82c1d-93b0-43cb-ba20-1e84ad9b5db4", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Windows-Copilot-Runtime-Fundament-fuer-offene-KI-Entwicklung-mit-APIs-und-SLMs-9731468.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-24T15:57:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "c58da740-1644-4529-85a5-675bd85b7678", "title": "Microsoft stellt mit Windows Copilot Runtime die Weichen f\u00fcr KI-PCs und -Apps\u200b"}], "tags": {"DirectML": {"name": "DirectML", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "NPU": {"name": "NPU", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "NPUs": {"name": "NPUs", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "RAG": {"name": "RAG", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Recall": {"name": "Recall", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Satya Nadella": {"name": "Satya Nadella", "tag_type": "PER"}, "W3C": {"name": "W3C", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "WebNN": {"name": "WebNN", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Microsoft stellt mit Windows Copilot Runtime die Weichen f\u00fcr KI-PCs und -Apps\u200b"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T17:21:38.068177", "id": "76ef820f-c648-4d8e-a3b6-b3986a0111e6", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "5"}, {"created": "2024-05-24T17:15:34.017047", "id": "98526ed1-81d0-4903-a60d-bf76273c0c70", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-24T15:55:39", "id": "4f00e1c0-ab49-4324-9ed1-80da6e6b352f", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "\u00dcber 1000 Kommentare sammelte die Meldung Anfang M\u00e4rz vom 9000-Euro-Auto aus China.

Sogar die Polizei musste anr\u00fccken \u2013 allerdings nicht, um den Adler zu verhaften, sondern um den ordnungsgem\u00e4\u00dfen Abriss des Horstes zu protokollieren. In der Vergangenheit habe es wegen einer Nestabnahme bereits starke Kritik von einem Naturschutzverein gegeben, denn der Fischadler geh\u00f6rt zu den bedrohten Tierarten.\nDer hartn\u00e4ckige Vogel scheint den Strommast zu seinem pers\u00f6nlichen Penthouse erkl\u00e4rt zu haben, schlie\u00dflich versuche er sich seit einigen Jahren an der gleichen Stelle einen Horst zu bauen, hei\u00dft es in einer Pressemitteilung.

Dem Fischadler sei aber nichts passiert, stellt ein Polizeisprecher gegen\u00fcber heise online klar. Bei dem von der Polizei beobachteten Diebstahl sei er nicht zugegen gewesen.

Daf\u00fcr kann er jetzt aber monatelang aktiviert bleiben.\nDie Asteroidensonde Psyche der NASA hat sieben Monate nach ihrem Start ihren futuristischen Solarantrieb aktiviert, der sie in den kommenden anderthalb Jahren von etwa 135.000 km/h \u2013 relativ zur Erde \u2013 auf etwa 200.000 km/h beschleunigen soll. Das teilte die US-Weltraumagentur jetzt mit und erg\u00e4nzte, dass vorher alle \u00dcberpr\u00fcfungen der Sonde positive Ergebnisse erbracht h\u00e4tten. Deshalb habe man jetzt den \"vollen Cruise-Modus\" beginnen k\u00f6nnen, mit dem die Sonde erst Kurs auf den Mars nimmt, wo sie auf dem Weg zum Asteroideng\u00fcrtel noch einmal Schwung holen wird. Zwar sei der Schub durch den neuartigen Antrieb dadurch nur leicht \u2013 er ist demnach so schwach wie der Druck dreier kleiner Geldm\u00fcnzen auf der Hand \u2013 kann aber fast durchgehend erfolgen.\nViel weniger Treibstoff n\u00f6tig\nW\u00e4hrend herk\u00f6mmliche Weltraumsonden bislang durch chemische Reaktionen zwischen fl\u00fcssigen Brennstoffen angetrieben werden, wandelt Psyche mithilfe zweier riesiger Solaranlagen Sonnenenergie in Strom um, der in Tanks gelagertes Xenon-Gas-ionisiert. Mit den 922 kg gelagertes Gas, das auch in manchen Autoscheinwerfern zum Einsatz kommt, werden dann vier Ionentriebwerke angetrieben, die das Raumfahrzeug sanft in Richtung des Asteroiden schieben. W\u00fcrde die Sonde auf einen klassischen chemischen Antrieb setzen, w\u00e4re f\u00fcr die gleiche Route 15-mal so viel Treibstoff notwendig, hat die NASA erkl\u00e4rt. Stauraum, der nicht f\u00fcr Treibstoff ben\u00f6tigt wird, steht beispielsweise wissenschaftlicher Nutzlast zur Verf\u00fcgung. Antriebe wie der von Psyche k\u00f6nnten die Raumfahrt deshalb revolutionieren.\nPsyche ist am 13. Oktober in Richtung des metallreichen Asteroiden gestartet, nach dem sie benannt wurde.

Are there certain scenarios that uncover problems the planners hadn\u2019t anticipated?\nSchneider\u2019s area of specialty is studying how humans interact with technology, and she found that certain types of disruptions created interesting and unexpected reactions.\nCyberattacks \u2014 like a hack of the electrical grid or a wiper malware infection in military communications systems \u2014 elicit a completely different response from wargame participants than traditional physical ones, she said.\n\u201cThis has been one of the most interesting scholarly puzzles that I have ever worked with,\u201d Schneider told the Click Here podcast.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nCLICK HERE: When I think of wargames, I think of tabletop exercises like you see in the movies with miniature tanks and destroyers moving around on a map. Are wargames like that anymore?\nJACQUELYN SCHNEIDER: Those games still exist, and there's a whole community that deals with miniatures and wargames. But a lot of what I do is look at decision making and how individuals make decisions in uncertain conditions. So it\u2019s more like a National Security Council sitting around a table and having those difficult conversations about what to do in a crisis.\nCH: How is the gaming scenario set up?\nJS: Generally, I organize people in groups of four to six, and I tell them to take a role. They're relatively small groups, so you get that really rich discussion about the crisis and the uncertainty.\nOften I'll have a Head of State, a Minister of Finance, a Minister of War, or other similar roles. If we're doing a U.S.-specific war game, we\u2019ll assign a Deputy Secretary of Defense, a Deputy Secretary of State, or a National Security Council advisor. Then, I\u2019ll have them play those roles in the context of the game.\nCH: When you look at the players\u2019 decision making process, what kind of information are you drawing from these conversations?\nJS: We actually don't get a lot of the good data about the conversations that they're having at the table. We rely on a few different data mechanisms. We give them response plans to fill out. The prompts are along the lines of: What are you doing? Why are you doing it? What are the means that you want to take? What are the risks about the plan that you're coming up with? That represents a kind of a group consensus.\nThen we use surveys and rely on asking questions like: Why did you do that? How did you feel about the other players? Did you feel like somebody was very dominant? If we had told you that you had a different type of capability, how would that have affected the way you played the game?\nThese questions and subsequent answers provide us with an individual level of behavioral understanding behind decisions made in the game. So both of those data sets are used to understand not only the games\u2019 outcomes, but why and how we got to those outcomes.\nCH: And when you conduct these wargames now, is there a role representing the cyber world, like someone from Cybercom or the National Cyber Mission Force or NSA?\nJS: In some games I\u2019ve run, we had former foreign ministers or former heads of state. And in other games, we had people from Silicon Valley who were leading AI companies or cyber companies. Sometimes we had military cyber officers. Sometimes they were American or from other parts of the world like Latin America or Europe. We had a wide range of expertise which allowed us to go back and ask, \u201cIf somebody's a cyber expert, do they play games differently than people who are nuclear experts?\u201d\nCH: What was the answer to that question?\nJS: They play the crises very similarly. The difference is in the nuance.\nWhat we found is those who had expertise in cyber operations were more likely to be more nuanced about how they used the cyber capability. So, for example, they'd say, \u201cHey, I'm going to activate the Reserves or the National Guard in order to augment homeland defense.\u201d\nThat's something that somebody who's not working the cyber mission set all the time doesn't understand. So that's where we saw big changes in the details. But on a larger level about how we as humans respond to cyber technologies, or how we as humans respond to crisis situations, we actually see very generalizable patterns that extend beyond individuals\u2019 expertise.\nCH: What have we learned since we realized that cyber is actually more in the adversarial mix than it was, say, just when there was Stuxnet?\nJS: This has been one of the most interesting scholarly puzzles that I have ever worked with. When I first started working with cyber operations and thinking about the impact of cyber operations on crises, it was in the early 2010s. People were really concerned that all the characteristics of the technology, the uncertainty about attribution, the timeliness of the ability to execute an offensive cyber operation, and the relative ease would all be an incendiary that would lead to conflict where there wouldn't otherwise be conflict.\nBut then I started running wargames. And I realized people react in very unusual ways to cyber operations. I would run experiments and wargames, and I would find that individuals don't respond to cyber operations like they would when faced with a physical threat.\nInstead, they treat cyber operations in this kind of anxiety-inducing way, where the uncertainty about cyber operations actually creates this kind of buffer area where they don't feel an impetus to respond violently to cyber.\nMy hunch here is that it's because of the way in which cyber operations create effects. It's virtual. It's hard for us to grasp when it has a significant effect. You don't drop a cyberattack and then something explodes. Even in the worst case scenario, somebody needs to piece back, how did this happen? Was it an accident? Did someone mean to do this, or did something just fail? That act of tracing things back and processing through why something occurs actually creates the emotional distance from the attack.\nAnd that allows us to have this emotional space to make more rational choices.\nI think as we see cyber operations there, we know that cyber operations are proliferating, but this is occurring all the time. But one of the most fundamentally interesting things is how they have stayed below this kind of threshold of violent conflict, and how they fall behind a violent conflict in the world instead of leading to violent conflict.\nCH: Can you talk a little bit about the authorities that are needed to launch cyberattacks? There seems to be a misconception that, to deploy an attack, all you need to do is push a button.\nJS: Talking about it from an American perspective, there are authorities that we have created that we believe are important in order to make sure that the use of cyber operations are appropriate and effective. So, any use of force within what the US president uses is tied to some level of authority.\nThe president created executive agencies and he had to approve them in order to use offensive cyber. This happened in the Obama administration. During the Trump administration, these authorities were delegated down to the combatant command level \u2014 in this case, Cyber Command.\nCyber Command had more direct authorities to execute offensive cyber. They still have internal requirements in order to conduct those operations; just because you say that Cyber Command might have an authority, that does not mean that the airman or the lieutenant that's on the keyboard can now conduct an operation.\nThey still have to go through a tasking process within the Department of Defense and within Cyber Command that includes lawyers to make sure that what is occurring is appropriate. So, these are all part of the bureaucratic process of making cyber decisions.\nCH: Could you make a lot of decisions in advance and decide not push the button until the appropriate time?\nJS: That has been the constant tension about cyber operations. Let's say I develop a GPS guided bomb. I can shelf a series of different targets\u2019 tiering plans. I can say, based on my bomb and based on a target that I've already identified, exactly how I think we could destroy that target with my assessment about what the potential risks and collateral damage could be.\nNow, when you go into war, you then apply context to that targeting solution. That should give you more information about who might be near the facility, what the stakes are in the conflict, right? And then you make the choice.\nBut you can have a target on the shelf, and you still have to make a decision the day of \u2014 whether the context dictates that that targeteering will be effective and appropriate. We thought we could apply those same analogies to cyber operations. At the beginning of cyber operations in the U.S., we thought about building cyberattacks like we would build those kinds of bombing plans. The problem is the network changes all the time.\nAnd that's the big difference between a bomb and a cyberattack. Because with deploying a bomb targeting a building, for example, it's going to take a bit of time for the parameters of that building to change. That's not true in cyber operations. Something that worked two hours ago might not work when you go to execute it.\nSo you can't actually put a cyberattack on the shelf. You can try to find vulnerabilities or exploits that are more pervasive or that are more longer lasting, but then the actual decision to execute, you're still going to need that final sign off about context.\nCH: You wrote an article for Foreign Affairs magazine about why the military can't trust AI. What was the message you were trying to send?\nJS: The hope was that we\u2019d give them more nuance. My co-author Max Lampart is a computer scientist who works closely with artificial intelligence, and we've been working together to use artificial intelligence in the context of board games. What we found in our research and what Max finds in his broader research with artificial intelligence is that there's a limit to the technology where the technology may mimic our conversations in our language, but is unable to internalize the way we make decisions and because of their lack of internalization.\nYou can't ever be sure what the AI is going to do. And when that comes to war, what that means is that even if you have a majority of responses that emulate or mimic the way humans would respond, you have the chance to win. That it's going to go nuclear early in a conflict, which we actually find in some of this work.\nSo the concern is if you are relying on AI and more specifically large language models to make strategic decisions, that you may find that they are going to escalate in a way that might be dangerous or that humans wouldn't do.\nThis is actually something we've seen in board gaming for a long time \u2014 the use of computer models. The computer model wants to win the game. As a human during wartime, winning the war is very complicated. But for the computer model, especially in the early 1960s when we started doing this in war gaming, that just meant we'll go violent and use nuclear weapons early because you win. And the computer didn't understand the moral and ethical, the human implications.\nThese new models are better about emulating our human understandings or concerns about the use of violence, but they still don't internalize that that is.\nCH: Do you get the sense that this may be one of the places where the U.S. and China agree \u2014 that AI needs to stay out of weapons launch decisions?\nJS: This is where the military is a really varied group of people. It's organizations and people. I think if you look at what's coming out of the Office of Secretary of Defense policy, they are really in tune with the dangers of broad use of artificial intelligence without thinking about the risks and the dangers.\nSo you can see policies about tests and evaluation and thinking about safety, and I think we\u2019re really responsible and a great model going forward. But some of this technology is already in how we use what we consider smart weapons.\nAs we increase the automation and the artificial intelligence resident within these weapons, then you need to get to the operator level. Does the operator understand the limitations of the artificial intelligence that's enabling the weapon system? And I think we're not quite there yet.\nHaving the operators,war fighters and commanders understand the limits of the technology to the same extent that those policies do, I think that's kind of where we need to be concerned.\nDina Temple-Raston\nis the Host and Managing Editor of the Click Here podcast as well as a senior correspondent at Recorded Future News.

We test out connections through different countries, and run speed tests using speedtest.net to measure and compare results. We also test whether the VPN has any DNS leaks while connecting, which would potentially provide information to your ISP or other services about what sites you visit or your originating location or IP address. We evaluate how easy each service is to navigate via website and app, how well it works for streaming content, and its customer service offerings. All of these factors give us a view into how well the VPN works, and how secure it is.\nWhat to Consider\nPerformance\nSimultaneous connections\nSecurity\nKill switch\nGeoblocks and streaming\nPlatforms\nCountries and servers\nTrial length and price\nWhile iPhones tend to have excellent connectivity, using your mobile data as a hotspot while traveling can get expensive. You might turn to local hotels, airports, or coffee shops with Wi-Fi to get online -- but this is a major security risk, especially if you're traveling in a foreign country since there's no telling who or what is monitoring your traffic.\nWe recommend using a virtual private network (VPN) service that works with your iPhone and iPad to keep your data and browsing safe while on the go. And if you're looking to stream content that isn't available in your area, a VPN can potentially unlock access (in some cases, with dubious legality). We've analyzed and ranked the top VPN services we've tested and researched over the years that offer solid iPhone and iPad clients, good performance, strong security, and are suitable for the Apple ecosystem.\nAlso: The best travel VPNs\nWhat is the best VPN for iPhone and iPad right now?\nBased on extensive testing, our pick for the best VPN for iPhone and iPad overall is NordVPN. Recent updates have increased the VPN's server and country availability, and while it is not the cheapest service available, NordVPN is known for its rapid speeds and solid connectivity.\nCheck out our picks for the top VPNs for iPhones and iPads below.\nBest VPN services for iPhones and iPads in 2024\nNordVPN\nBest VPN overall\nNordVPN is one of the more popular VPN offerings on the iPhone App Store. Installing NordVPN on the iPhone is a simple, painless way to secure predictable performance across regions, and the service is compatible with iOS 13.0 or later.\nNordVPN's interface is user-friendly, and during testing, we found the service offered consistent, reliable speeds that do not impact streaming services or make a noticeable difference to internet surfing.\nIt has many tools in addition to a standard VPN service. NordVPN's Onion over VPN is a special category of NordVPN servers that enables Tor capabilities, supports peer-to-peer file sharing, and allows you to connect through a second server for an added layer of protection. You can also set up a dedicated IP address for an additional fee.\nDue to recent updates, we now consider this VPN to be one of the best available -- combining speed, server availability, reliability, and a high number of simultaneous connections. NordVPN has increased the number of simultaneous connections you can have from six to ten devices. New server locations have also increased from 60 to 111, which now includes Greenland, the Isle of Man, Trinidad and Tobago, and Bermuda.\nI've used NordVPN for years and have always been impressed with its stable connectivity and rapid speeds. Customers generally report fast speeds and minimal buffering with easy setup, although some caution that you should turn off auto-renewal.\nReview: NordVPN\nIn addition to iOS, NordVPN runs on all the most popular platforms. Prices start from $3.69 per month on a two-year standard plan, with a bonus of three months of free access. Yearly plans begin at $4.59/month. If you only want to try out NordVPN for a month, prices begin at $12.99/month.\nNordVPN has also recently begun offering additional cybersecurity options, such as identity theft and cyber extortion coverage, under Ultimate plans, which begin at $6.69/month.\nNordVPN features: Apple App Store rating: 4.7 | Simultaneous connections: 10 | Kill switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Android TV | Logging: None, except billing data | Countries: 111 | Servers: 6,000+ | Money-back guarantee: 30 days\nSurfshark VPN\nBest budget VPN\nSurfshark VPN is an affordable and reliable service. When we reviewed Surfshark, we found no information leaks, and it had fast connection times. Luckily, the company doesn't skimp on security. It offers AES-256-GCM, RSA-2048, and Perfect Forward Secrecy encryption. Surfshark supports devices running iOS 10.3 or higher. If you want protection for a macOS machine, you will need macOS 10.15 or later and an active subscription.\nSurfshark has many features, including ad and tracker blocking, a data breach scanner, and multi-hop connections (connecting through two servers). This VPN is excellent for iPhone and iPad users because of its user-friendliness, uncomplicated and quick connection process, and reasonable price point.\nThat said, specific tools aren't available for iOS devices, which is the case across the board. If you want to use the Bypasser tool (Surfshark's split tunneling feature), you must use the Windows or Android app.\nI enjoy using Surfshark as a 'one size fits all' VPN solution. Sometimes, the speeds aren't the best while streaming, but it is extremely quick to connect. I also enjoy the 'pause' function available, which allows you to resume your normal connection for five minutes, 30 minutes, or a few hours. Customers say that speeds are relatively fast and streaming works the majority of the time, although some have experienced issues with Netflix and other popular content services.\nReview: Surfshark VPN\nSurfshark often offers promotions to lure new consumers to its plans. Promotions of around 80 - 85% off appear frequently, so consider the discount the VPN provider's typical price range.\nCurrently, you can pay $15.45 for a month of access, $2.79 per month on a one-year plan, or only $2.19 if you are happy to remain a subscriber for at least two years. The VPN provider has also thrown in three months of free access on 24-month plans.\nSurfshark VPN features: Apple App Store rating: 4.8 | Simultaneous Connections: Unlimited | Kill switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, FireTV | Logging: None, except billing data | Countries: 100+, 3,200 servers | Money-back guarantee: 30 days\nExpressVPN\nBest VPN for server range and usability\nThe ExpressVPN app supports iOS back to iOS 12. So, as long as your iPhone or iPad runs on iOS 12 or higher, you can use ExpressVPN. In addition to iOS, it supports all major platforms, including macOS X 10.11 and above. There are browser extensions for Edge, Chrome, and Firefox, and a VPN service for gaming is also available.\nIf you want the most options for countries to connect to, ExpressVPN has servers located in 94 countries. ExpressVPN ranks among the fastest VPNs, so it shouldn't reduce your connection speeds as much as the average VPN.\nReview: ExpressVPN\nExpressVPN doesn't maintain browsing history logs, but it does keep track of some information, such as the dates you connect and the location of the VPN server you connect to. The details of what is and isn't logged are stated in ExpressVPN's privacy policy.\nI've used ExpressVPN for years and I've found it to be a speedy, reliable service with a great server network. Concerning customer reviews, many are positive overall, but some note that servers can often be blocked when users attempt to use streaming services or access specific websites. Price hikes on renewal aren't popular, either.\nOverall, if you're looking for a set-and-forget VPN with decent speeds and user-friendliness, ExpressVPN is a top pick. The monthly plan is limited to eight simultaneous devices, whereas six-month or annual plans offer up to eight connected devices.\nOther subscription offers are $9.99 monthly for six months or $12.95 for one month of access. Alternatively, signing up for a 12-month plan is only $6.67/month, with three months of access for free and a year of Backblaze cloud backup. The iPhone app comes with a 7-day free trial.\nExpressVPN features: Apple App Store rating: 4.7 | Simultaneous connections: 8 | Kill switch: Yes | Platforms: Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Chromebook, and more | Logging: No browsing logs, some connection logs | Countries: 105 | Money-back guarantee: 30 days\nIPVanish VPN\nBest configurable VPN for iPhone and iPad\nIPVanish has depth and plenty of configuration settings for those who want to control almost every aspect of their VPN connection.\nWhile it's not the most stylish VPN with the best interface, IPVanish VPN has many protocols, so you'll always know what to expect regardless of what you're connecting to. The app has an abundance of configuration options, and there's an extensive range of server selection options. The service is also independently security-audited.\nReview: IPVanish VPN\nIPVanish supports devices back to iOS 14, and clients for macOS are available from 10.11/10.12 and later.\nWe found IPVanish to be impressively fast and quick to connect. However, it couldn't hide that we connected through a VPN, which could be an issue in countries where internet connectivity and activities are monitored at the state or ISP level. That said, IPVanish's data transfers were secure and provided a good user experience. Customers report they are happy with IPVanish's customer service and the overall speed and reliability of the VPN.\nIPVanish is an excellent option for iOS and Mac devices. You can sign up for a two-year plan for $2.19 per month or a yearly subscription for $2.79/month. Alternatively, if you don't want to sign up for the long haul, you can pay $10.99 for a month of access.\nIPVanish VPN features: Apple App Store rating: 4.5 | Simultaneous connections: Unlimited | Kill switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Android TV, FireTV, and Kodi | Logging: None, except billing data | Servers: 2,200+ | Locations: 75 | Money-back guarantee: 30 days\nProton VPN\nBest free VPN for iPhone and iPad\nProton VPN has an excellent paid service that ranks as one of the fastest VPNs and best VPNs overall. In general, we recommend you avoid free VPNs. A free VPN service could even make money selling your data, which defeats the purpose of using a VPN to protect your identity, activities, and other information.\nReview: Proton VPN\nThe only situation where using a free VPN wouldn't necessarily come with security concerns is when it's a free version of a reputable paid service, as with Proton VPN. While limited to servers in five countries, you know that the plan is supported by paid subscribers and your data is safe. You won't be bombarded with adverts, either.\nDespite poor Trustpilot reviews, many users report a positive experience with this VPN provider, noting its ease of use, low CAPTCHA block rates on websites, and stable connectivity.\nIf, however, you are interested in adopting the paid version of Proton VPN, you can sign up for a 24-month VPN plan at $4.49/month, a 12-month subscription at $4.99, or a one-month agreement at $9.99. Note that Proton VPN requires iOS 14.0 or later.\nThough ProtonVPN is a Swiss company, you can make payments in US dollars.\nProton VPN iOS features: Apple App Store rating: 4.6 | Simultaneous connections: 1 (free) Up to 10 (paid) | Kill switch: Yes | Logging: No-logs policy | Customer service: FAQ, email | Data limit: None | Free countries: 5 | Free servers: 100+ | Paid plans: 4,000+ servers in 91 countries\nWhat is the best VPN for iPhone and iPad?\nWe consider NordVPN the best VPN for the iPhone and iPad. It's one of the most popular VPNs for Apple devices overall, with good customer ratings. Due to recent updates, we consider this VPN to be the best available -- combining speed, server availability, reliability, and a high number of simultaneous connections. However, if you don't think this VPN is right for you, we have included the price point and key features of our top recommended VPNs below.\nBest VPN for iPhone and iPad\nStarting price\nKill switch\nApple App Store rating\nSimultaneous connections\nNordVPN\n$3.69+ per month\nYes\n4.7\nUp to 10\nSurfshark VPN\n$2.19+ per month\nYes\n4.8\nUnlimited\nExpressVPN\n$6.67+ per month\nYes\n4.7\nUp to 8\nIPVanish VPN\n$2.19+ per month\nYes\n4.5\nUnlimited\nProton VPN\nFree with limited services or $4.99 per month\nYes\n4.6\n1 or up to 10\n*Lowest price at the time of writing. Please note that prices may vary based on retailer and available promotions, sales, or discounts.\nWhich is the right iPhone and iPad VPN for you?\nAlthough we have our own opinions on the best VPN for iPhone and iPad, and ZDNET considers NordVPN as the best choice currently, your personal preferences will also factor into the decision. If you need a VPN for more than five or six devices, you'll want to prioritize VPN services with unlimited connections, such as IPVanish or Surfshark. But if speed is most important, you'll want to look at NordVPN or ExpressVPN.\nA great thing about the selections for the best VPN for iPhone and iPad list is they all have a 30-day -- or more -- money-back guarantee. A month should give you enough time to test any of these VPNs, see which features you love, and decide.\nChoose this VPN for iPhone and iPad...\nIf you want...\nNordVPN\nThe best iPhone and iPad VPN overall. NordVPN is a solid, feature-rich VPN. NordVPN's speeds are impressive, but the price point for this reliable, secure VPN on shorter plans might be offputting for some.\nSurfshark VPN\nA top VPN that can just about do it all, and for an affordable price. Surfshark performs well in speed tests, earned solid customer reviews, and has an easy-to-use mobile interface.\nExpressVPN\nA stable choice for iOS. We've found that ExpressVPN connections are usually reliable and speedy. The mobile VPN is simple, user-friendly, and comes packed with different server options. You can also take advantage of a 7-day free trial.\nIPVanish VPN\nA highly flexible VPN. IPVanish offers a range of security and connectivity settings for you to choose from, although if you want to take full advantage of different protocols, you will want some technical knowledge.\nProton VPN\nA free VPN. This Swiss VPN provider takes security seriously, and while the free version is restricted, it is still an excellent choice -- but the paid option removes all limits.\nFactors to consider when choosing a VPN for iPhone and iPad\nWhen you are selecting your new iPhone or iPad VPN, you need to consider the following factors:\nCost: You need to consider the overall cost of your new Apple-ready VPN. Try to take advantage of promotions, but ignore countdown timers -- they typically are just marketing tools. While top-notch VPNs can cost upwards of $10/month, many are available for only a few dollars. Many VPN providers will also give users a free seven-day iOS trial.\n-\nSimultaneous connections: If you're paying for a VPN suitable for your iPhone or iPad, you might still want to use it across multiple devices, such as a desktop PC or laptop. We recommend you sign up for a plan with support for at least four to six devices.\n-\nContract length: You also need to decide how long you want a VPN for. If you opt for a two-year term you tend to secure the best prices, but there are monthly, six-month, and one-year options available. After you've made a selection, you typically have a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n-\nApps: When selecting an iPhone or iPad VPN, you need to try it out first to ensure you like its accompanying iOS app. Some VPNs, for example, have great desktop software but lack in the mobile app department, which may not be as intuitive or easy to use.\n-\nHow did we choose these iPhone and iPad VPNs?\nMany providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by members of our ZDNET team. We've been talking about other VPNs for years, spoken with their management and their users, and developed a generally favorable impression.\nZDNET does test VPN services from multiple locations, but we can't test from all locations. Every home, every community, every local ISP, and every nation has a different infrastructure. It's essential that once you choose, you test for all your likely usage profiles and only then make the decision to keep the service or request a money-back guaranteed refund, which all these VPNs have.\nIf you experience traffic slowdowns, check your VPN and the Wi-Fi connection between your device and your router or access point. Sometimes, connectivity issues begin at the source, and in other cases, switching your selected VPN server may be enough to resolve speed problems or connectivity drops.\nWe analyzed the best VPNs for iPhone and iPad below using the following criteria that were most important in helping you make an informed decision:\nPerformance: Our top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags, making it intolerable.\n-\nSimultaneous connections: Many VPNs limit how many devices you can connect to a service at the same time. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, and possibly even a smart TV you want to connect to a VPN, you'd need a service that allows at least five simultaneous connections.\n-\nSecurity: There's no point using a VPN unless their security protocols and encryption levels are up to scratch. We also ensured the development team behind each recommended VPN cared about making security improvements over time and patching reported bugs.\n-\nKill switch: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection. It is an important feature for a VPN to have, as it protects by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.\n-\nGeoblocks and streaming: We know VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. We ensured that our top recommendations performed well in these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while you are streaming.\n-\nPlatforms: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? Our iPhone and iPad VPN recommendations, naturally, have to run easy-to-use and intuitive mobile apps.\n-\nCountries & servers: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers and whether or not there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.\n-\nTrial length & price: Each VPN we recommend has a solid money-back guarantee.\n-\nHow do I set up a VPN on my iPhone?\nSetting up a VPN on your iPhone is fairly simple. It requires you to download one of the apps mentioned on our list in the Apple App Store. Once you've created a login and started your subscription, you are ready to securely connect.\nEnsure you do not download any apps from untrusted sources.\nMobile device management (MDM) solutions utilizing VPNs can be configured in iOS settings.\nDo I need a VPN if I just use my carrier's data?\nPerhaps. That depends on how much you trust your carrier. You're better off encrypting your data when it's in motion, whether you use Wi-Fi or a carrier connection. Overall, it's still recommended to use a VPN no matter the type of internet access you have in use.\nIsn't iCloud+ Private Relay a VPN? Why do I need another VPN?\nApple iCloud+ Private Relay is a feature of iCloud+. If you buy any iCloud storage, you'll get the iCloud+ features. But while Private Relay can hide your email address and location, it only does it when you're using Safari. If you're using Chrome (or any applications that use the Internet directly), you're out of luck. The service is also not available in all countries.\nIt also shows up as a proxy server. You also can't change or hide your location, as you can with a full VPN. Private Relay is a feature of iCloud+. A VPN is a full security solution.\nAre there any free iPhone or iPad VPNs?\nThere are many free VPNs available for mobile devices including those in Apple's ecosystem. However, nothing in life is truly free, and you will likely be handing over your data in return for the service. They may also not be trustworthy, may be ad-supported, and may track your online activities.\nThose that are free but from trustworthy companies are few and far between. ProtonVPN's free VPN is an option we support, although it is extremely limited.\nWhat is the best VPN for travel?\nVPNs are important for establishing secure connections when abroad. Whether you're working from another country or simply want to stream your favorite TV show, we compiled a list of the best VPNs for travel.\nWhat is the best VPN overall for different operating systems?\nYou might want a VPN that works best with the iOS ecosystem or another operating system. If you're on the hunt for other trustworthy options, we've also created a guide to the best VPN services of 2024 with an explainer on free VPNs, and whether or not they're worth it.\nAre there alternative iPhone & iPad VPNs worth considering?\nOther than our recommendations for the best VPNs for iPhone and iPad, other services can get the job done. Here are a few alternative options that are secure and reputable:", "hash": "5a886dba2a973281fad8bde80d8c92630f97993a9d3ad1a0f3153f0666ea4d12", "id": "0d83df8c-ae25-4976-ac60-f3bcb70629b3", "link": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone-vpn/%23ftag=RSSbaffb68", "osint_source_id": "ed5d2c82-3035-490c-af95-5844977f7f3d", "published": "2024-05-24T15:00:22", "source": "https://www.zdnet.com/topic/security/rss.xml", "story_id": "67a6319c-01be-4ff7-af03-bd7bce3b9fb0", "title": "The best VPN services for iPhone and iPad in 2024: Expert tested and reviewed"}], "tags": {"Apple": {"name": "Apple", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Bermuda": {"name": "Bermuda", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Chrome": {"name": "Chrome", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Data breach": {"name": "Data breach", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "Greenland": {"name": "Greenland", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Internet": {"name": "Internet", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Isle of Man": {"name": "Isle of Man", "tag_type": "Country"}, "ProtonVPN": {"name": "ProtonVPN", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Safari": {"name": "Safari", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Trinidad and Tobago": {"name": "Trinidad and Tobago", "tag_type": "Country"}, "VPN": {"name": "VPN", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Wi-Fi": {"name": "Wi-Fi", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "ZDNet": {"name": "ZDNet", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "iPad": {"name": "iPad", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "iPhones": {"name": "iPhones", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "The best VPN services for iPhone and iPad in 2024: Expert tested and reviewed"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T17:30:33.061525", "id": "4b807707-0eed-4ad4-bf36-a9a5b4883644", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "5"}], "created": "2024-05-24T15:00:00", "id": "9a067355-9cf2-4915-a043-dbefe71fbcf5", "news_items": [{"author": "Isabel Gr\u00fcnewald", "content": "KI-Update Deep-Dive: KI in der Bildung \u2013 Fluch oder Segen?\nLernen mit oder trotz k\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz.

This law would also affect other businesses such as fireworks, body branding, and even BB guns. Democrat Rebecca Bauer-Kahan and Republican Juan Alanis pushed for passage of the bill, which ended up receiving 65 out of possible 80 yes votes, and zero no votes with 15 assembly members listed as not voting. Before the bill becomes law, it still has to pass the State Senate and then be signed by Governor Gavin Newsom. Louisiana was the first state to pass an age verification law for adult sites in 2022.

ICE told Access Now and Harvard that it does not have any of the sought documentation for a biometric database that it controls.\nThe lawsuit against ICE focuses on its Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) program, which the agency\u2019s website has called a \u201cnotable coordination and partnership\u201d effort focused on the \u201cbiometric and biographic identification of priority undocumented individuals who are incarcerated within federal, state, and local prisons and jails,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\nERO manages the apprehensions, arrests, detentions and removals of noncitizens already in the U.S.\nThrough ERO, ICE has signed cooperation agreements with the Mexican, Guatemalan and other foreign governments going back to 2010, according to its website. Access Now\u2019s FOIA request sought the full text of data sharing agreements forged between ICE and Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\nThe CBP lawsuit similarly focuses on its refusal to turn over documents requested under FOIA law, but homes in on the agency\u2019s controversial CBP One app. The portal is the only way for migrants to make appointments with the agency and obtain other services, but it requires their biometric information.\nCBP One is currently being investigated by both the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General and its Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. According to an internal CBP One privacy impact assessment cited by the lawsuit, the app can collect biographical information, images and geolocation.\nIn February CBP disclosed on the Federal Register that the app also will begin gathering biometric information from nonimmigrants leaving the country. They will be required to provide photos with geolocation data to prove they have left.\nAccess Now alleges that CBP One can use the data it gathers for automated decision making, profiling and \u201cregistering people on the move.\u201d It is seeking a variety of relevant records documenting how the app functions and the number of people in the Mexican, Guatemalan, Honduran and El Salvadoran governments who access CBP One to obtain data about migrants.\nCBP and ICE did not respond to a request for comment.\nLessons from the helpline\nAccess Now is particularly connected to the experience of undocumented immigrants in part because it maintains a Helpline designed to provide them technical assistance.\nThe advocacy group said the experience of real world migrants informed its efforts to collect more information on ICE and CBP\u2019s data sharing arrangements with Latin American governments as well as details about the biometric databases they maintain.\nAccess Now has deeply researched the experience of Salvadorans who have allegedly been wrongly detained and declared to be criminals upon entering the U.S. due to inaccurate data collected by their government. Last June it appealed to the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to investigate. DHS houses CBP and ICE.\nIn March of 2022, El Salvador enacted an emergency measure meant to control gangs, giving its National Police unprecedented authority to arrest people without any accountability, according to Access Now.\nIndividual stories of Salvadorans who have been swept up and criminalized by the American immigration apparatus have been a focus for the advocacy group, which has uncovered several cases where inaccurate data from the Salvadoran government has led noncriminals to be arrested and indefinitely detained by the U.S. government.\nAccess Now\u2019s report on El Salvador notes that the Department of State\u2019s 2022 Human Rights Report found credible allegations of significant rights abuses by the Salvadoran National Police. Those abuses allegedly include forced disappearances and arbitrary arrests often made for personal reasons.\nThe data swapping agreement between the U.S. and Salvadoran governments has led the U.S. to wrongly criminalize Salvadoran migrants, Access Now says.\n\u201cDHS obtains information from a growing number of foreign sources, including through data-sharing agreements with governments that have a history of violence toward their own citizens, such as El Salvador,\u201d Access Now\u2019s synopsis of its call for an investigation said.\nIt added that its complaint filed with DHS targets agreements between the U.S. and El Salvador, \u201chighlighting how they have allowed a steady stream of unsubstantiated information to enter the databases used for U.S. immigration proceedings.\u201d\nSuzanne Smalley\nis a reporter covering privacy, disinformation and cybersecurity policy for The Record.

Doch wer jetzt an Fiesta oder Focus denkt, der irrt. Der Transit ist zusammen mit dem Tourneo eines der erfolgreichsten Nutzfahrzeuge in Europa und kaum ein Modell ist wichtiger f\u00fcr Ford. Das K\u00f6lner Unternehmen will auch mit den batterieelektrischen Versionen seiner Vans und leichten Nutzfahrzeuge vorne mitspielen und bietet sie parallel zu den beliebten Diesel-Motorisierungen an. Die Marke bewirbt sie mit um bis zu 40 Prozent niedrigeren Betriebskosten. Ein Vorserienexemplar stand uns zu einer kurzen Probefahrt zur Verf\u00fcgung. Mit dem Tourneo sollen vor allem Kunden angesprochen werden, die einen gro\u00dfen Pkw suchen. Nutzfahrzeugambiente wird daher peinlich vermieden, so gut es eben geht. Und das tut es. Genauso erfolgreich war Ford bei der Abstimmung des Fahrwerks, das keine Transporter-Gef\u00fchle mehr anklingen l\u00e4sst.\nKomfort wie im Pkw\nDer in der T\u00fcrkei produzierte Tourneo erreicht beim Interieur ein Niveau wie von Mittelklasse-Limousinen oder Kompakt-SUV. Displays hinter dem Steuer und in der Mitte der Armaturentafel (13 Zoll Diagonale) ersetzen herk\u00f6mmliche Instrumente, informieren \u00fcber alle wichtigen Details und dienen als Zentrale f\u00fcr Fords \"Sync4\"-Infotainment, respektive f\u00fcr die serienm\u00e4\u00dfige Android-Auto- und Apple-CarPlay-Konnektivit\u00e4t. Auf Wunsch gibt es elektrisch einstellbare Kunstledersitze, Sitzheizung und getrennte Klimaregelung auch f\u00fcr die Passagiere hinter der ersten Reihe, ein festes Panoramadach und elektrische Schiebet\u00fcren. Die m\u00e4chtige Heckklappe \u00f6ffnet allerdings weiterhin unmotorisiert.\nElektroauto Ford Tourneo (8 Bilder)\n(Bild: Ford)\nNach dem Druck auf den Startknopf kann die Fahrtrichtung per Lenkstockhebel \u2013 leider unbeleuchtet \u2013 gew\u00e4hlt werden. Sehr flott und fast lautlos beschleunigt der Tourneo, sein Elektromotor im Heck leistet 160 kW und bietet 415 Nm maximales Drehmoment. Kurz in eine L\u00fccke gesprungen oder einen langen Anstieg ohne Tempoverlust hinauffahren f\u00fchlt sich bei leerem Fahrzeug geradezu leichtf\u00fc\u00dfig an. Angenehm ist die Option auf Einpedalfahren mit kr\u00e4ftiger Rekuperation beim Loslassen des Fahrpedals. Die Bremse muss man nur noch an Ampeln, starkem Gef\u00e4lle oder bisweilen bei unbedachten Man\u00f6vern anderer Verkehrsteilnehmer bet\u00e4tigen.\nLeichtg\u00e4ngig, aber mit Gef\u00fchl\nDie 82,5 kWh fassende Batterie zwischen den Achsen l\u00e4sst den elektrischen Tourneo satt auf der Stra\u00dfe liegen, wozu auch sp\u00fcrbar seine hintere Einzelradaufh\u00e4ngung beitr\u00e4gt. Der Fahrwerkskomfort ist dank des Zusatzgewichts unbeladen besser als bei den herk\u00f6mmlich motorisierten Versionen. Die Lenkung ist zwar sehr leichtg\u00e4ngig, doch bietet sie ohne Antriebskr\u00e4fte auf der Vorderachse ein besseres Gef\u00fchl f\u00fcr die Stra\u00dfe. So w\u00fcnscht man sich das auch bei einigen Elektro-Pkw, die mit dem Handikap eines Frontantriebs leben m\u00fcssen. Beim Tourneo ist es \u00fcbrigens eine Alleinstellung der Elektroversion, die anderen Motorisierungen haben weiterhin Frontantrieb.\nElektroauto Ford Tourneo (6 Bilder)\n(Bild: Ford)\nPlatz bietet nicht nur die 5,45 m lange XL-Version auf den drei Sitzreihen mehr als genug. Auch die Normvariante mit 5,05 m L\u00e4nge bietet viel Lebensraum und ein Sitzsystem, das sich mit wenigen Handgriffen den W\u00fcnschen der maximal acht Insassen oder der spezifischen Nutzung anpasst. Das Gep\u00e4ckvolumen ist in dem E-Tourneo Bus in jeder Konfiguration gro\u00df, denn zwischen 672 und 5908 Litern ist je nach Sitzbelegung drin. Die vielen Ablagen im Armaturenbrett, in den T\u00fcren und an den Sitzen sind praktisch, aber leider nicht auskleidet und lassen daher kleine Gegenst\u00e4nde klappern. Au\u00dfer zahlreichen USB-Ladeports und induktiver Smartphoneladung bietet der Ford Steckdosen f\u00fcr Heim-Elektroger\u00e4te mit bis zu 2,3 kW.\nZwei Tonnen Anh\u00e4ngelast\nDie maximale Nutzlast ist bei 3400 kg zul\u00e4ssigem Gesamtgewicht durch den gewichtigen Akku auf 700 Kilogramm begrenzt. Von der Anh\u00e4ngelast bleiben immerhin zwei Tonnen. Wer sich zur\u00fcckh\u00e4lt und nicht st\u00e4ndig schwer beladen f\u00e4hrt, hat eine Chance, die versprochene Reichweite von 300 km zu erreichen, die bei einem Normverbrauch zwischen 24,7 und 41,4 kWh/100 km m\u00f6glich ist. Zum Kilometerfressen auf der Langstrecke eignen sich die Diesel, die zudem auch als Allradler verf\u00fcgbar sind, deutlich besser. Einen Kompromiss macht der Tourneo mit Plug-in-Hybridantrieb, der 171 kW Systemleistung bietet und rein elektrisch bis zu 50 km schaffen soll.\nElektroauto Ford Tourneo (4 Bilder)\n(Bild: Ford)\nDer Ford E-Tourneo l\u00e4dt mit maximalen 125 kW an Gleichstrom und soll so bestenfalls von 15(!) auf 80 Prozent gut 41 Minuten ben\u00f6tigen, entsprechend 38 km Reichweite alle f\u00fcnf Minuten. Eine serienm\u00e4\u00dfige W\u00e4rmepumpe steigert die Effizienz der Lade- und Entladevorg\u00e4nge. Beim eingebauten Wechselstromladeger\u00e4t beschr\u00e4nkt Ford sein Angebot auf einen dreiphasigen 11-kW-Lader, was nur durchschnittlich flotte AC-Ladevorg\u00e4nge erm\u00f6glicht. Ford bietet dazu eine Wallbox an und verspricht eine Ladedauer von unter acht Stunden. Die Ladestecker liegen unter dem rechten Scheinwerfer.\nDer Basispreis f\u00fcr den m\u00e4\u00dfig ausgestatteten Ford E-Tourneo Trend liegt bei 66.818 Euro (brutto). Die Edelversion \"Titanium X\" mit LED-Licht, elektrischen Schiebet\u00fcren, 19-Zoll-Alufelgen, Drei-Zonen-Klimaautomatik, Navigation und verschiedenen Fahrerassistenzsystemen kostet mindestens 75.624 Euro, f\u00fcr die Langversion mit 40 cm mehr Radstand verlangt Ford eine Aufzahlung von knapp 1000 Euro.

That\u2019s odd in itself, as these are the 13 servers that keep DNS working for the whole Internet. And yes, that\u2019s a bit of a simplification, it\u2019s not a single server for any of the 13 entities \u2014 the C \u201cserver\u201d is actually 12 different machines. The intent is for all those hundreds of servers around the world to serve the same DNS information, but over several days this week, the \u201cC\u201d servers just stopped pulling updates.\nThe most amusing/worrying part of this story is how long it took for the problem to be discovered and addressed. One researcher cracked a ha-ha-only-serious sort of joke, that he had reported the problem to Cogent, the owners of the \u201cC\u201d servers, but they didn\u2019t \u201cseem to understand that they manage a root server\u201d. The problem first started on Saturday, and wasn\u2019t noticed til Tuesday, when the servers were behind by three days. Updates started trickling late Tuesday or early Wednesday, and by the end of Wednesday, the servers were back in sync.\nCogent gave a statement that an \u201cunrelated routing policy change\u201d both affected the zone updates, and the system that should have alerted them to the problem. It seems there might room for an independent organization, monitoring some of this critical Internet Infrastructure.\nANSI Injection One\nOn to vulnerabilities, there were a pair of interesting ANSI escape sequence injection flaws discovered this week. ANSI escape codes are strings sent to the terminal that don\u2019t get directly written to the screen, but instead instruct the terminal how to write to the screen.\nJust for example, to get green text on the terminal, you can run:\nprintf 'Hello \\033[32mTHIS IS GREEN\\033[0m\\007'\nThe first vulnerability was in WinRAR, in the handling of the comments field of a RAR file. You may already see where this is going, but the problem is that ANSI escape sequences were blindly passed through as part of a comment, when doing something like listing the contents of a directory. This would be particularly useful to overwrite the file name to be extracted, to hide an executable or even path traversal attack. It\u2019s worth noting that the rar\nand unrar\nhad and have patched similar problems.\nANSI Injection Two\nThe second ANSI injection is a bit trickier. On the Mac, terminals like iterm2 can register as the default handler for URIs, like x-man-page://\n. The issue here is that some of those URIs aren\u2019t necessarily safe, like the man\nlink above, which supports the -P\npager option. That flag specifies which paging utility to use to show multiple pages of text, like less\n, more\n, etc. Opening that from a browser will at least show a warning before launch. ANSI codes lets an attack be quite sneaky, hiding the full text inside an in-terminal clickable link. The terminal won\u2019t warn the user about what they\u2019re about to do, so instant execution on click. Clever.\nQNAPping At The Wheel\nQNAP has had its share of problems over the years. The fine folks at Watchtowr decided to pitch in and try to find a few more, and then do a responsible disclosure to try to fix them the right way. And they didn\u2019t disappoint. The unofficial audit found fifteen issues, but this write-up focuses on CVE-2024-27130, an unauthenticated overflow leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).\nGiven the history of vulnerabilities, this shouldn\u2019t be a big surprise, but the source of QNAP OS is a mess. The underpinnings are a Linux system, but the web interface on top of that is a tangle of a custom web server written in C, CGI scripts also written in C, strange leftover code bits in languages like PHP, and at least one code snippet that looks suspiciously like a backdoor.\nAnd that\u2019s all before we get to the real vulnerability. The cgi-bin/filemanager/share.cgi\nendpoint segfaults when providing a valid \u201cssid\u201d and then an overlong file name. Inside the vulnerable code, it\u2019s a simple strcpy()\ncall, that copies an arbitrary, user-provided string into a fixed-length buffer. Write past the end of it, and you overwrite local variables, and then the return address, too. And because of how returns work, you also get to set some registers, like r0, the traditional first argument register. So\u2026 what if you just set the return address to the system()\nfunction, and put a pointer to shellcode in r0? It\u2019s pretty much that easy, except a real exploit would also need to overcome Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Watchtowr researchers opted to leave that step out, to hopefully give QNAP users a few extra days before attacks happen in the wild.\nBoost Got Audited, Too\nAnd in a win for the Open Source way, the Boost C++ library came through an audit with mostly flying colors. The most severe finding was a CRLF injection in HTTP Headers, that\u2019s only ranked medium severity. There are four low severity flaws, and two that only rank as informational. For the breadth of code that Boost covers, that seems pretty impressive. The entire report is available.\nWhere\u2019d that come from?\nThe Justice AV Solution Viewer is an interesting new target for malware. It was discovered that the official javs.com\nwebsite was hosting a backdoored installer for this software. The installer was signed by another valid signing key, and included an fffmpeg.exe\nbinary that gets up to no good on install.\nThe malware then proceeds to steal authentication cookies and passwords. As this software is primarily used in courtrooms, it\u2019s unclear what the exact motivation is. One possibility is that the viewer software is used by lawyers outside the courtroom, and a law office could be a very interesting target. For any computers infected, the recommendation is to re-image, and then also do a mass password rotation, to invalidate any stolen credentials.\nPhishing Fire Drills\n[Matt Linton], a \u201cchaos Specialist\u201d at Google has some thoughts about Phishing, specifically the style of phishing tests that get routinely aimed at users at larger companies. The TL;DR here is that phishing tests are a bad idea, and we should collectively stop it. A powerful argument he makes is that the Federally mandated phishing tests require existing anti-phishing protections to be disabled. A real attack is guaranteed not to look like the tests. And the data bears this out. Phishing tests are measurably counterproductive.\nHis suggestion is to stop doing phishing tests, and start doing phishing drills. Just an email to remind users that phishing is a thing, with links to more information, and instructions on what to do when the real thing comes along. And just for fun, take a look at Google\u2019s slick phishing quiz, and see how you score. Let us know in the comments!\nBits and Bytes\nIt\u2019s time again to update your GitLab installs. There\u2019s a handful of medium severity bugs, as well as one high severity fixed with this round of updates. That last one is a weakness in the GitLab VS code editor, that can enable Cross-Site Scripting attacks. It\u2019s unclear if that results in information exfiltration, or full account compromise, or perhaps the information loss can lead to compromise. Regardless, it\u2019s worth pulling out your console and running the update.\nLastpass has finally fixed one of its longstanding weak-points, now encrypting URLs in your secure vault. When the service first launched, URLs were deemed to computationally expensive to encrypt. In the handful of security breaches at LastPass since then, it\u2019s become very clear that unencrypted URLs was a terrible choice, as it gave that much more information away about users. Good for LastPass for continuing to work to right the ship.\nAnd finally, you should go check out the FLOSS Weekly interview from earlier this week! We interviewed Fran\u00e7ois Proulx, and talked about Poutine, a project from Boost Security, that scans code bases for vulnerable CI pipelines. If you work with GitHub actions or GitLab pipelines, it\u2019s worth checking out!\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Nun wurden drei Galaxien entdeckt, die w\u00e4hrend dieser Epoche entstehen.\nMit dem Weltraumteleskop James Webb ist es erstmals in der Geschichte der Astronomie gelungen, die Entstehung von fr\u00fchen Galaxien vor mehr als 13,3 Milliarden Jahren zu beobachten. Das hat ein Forschungsteam um Kasper Elm Heintz von der Universit\u00e4t Kopenhagen jetzt publik gemacht. Das jetzt analysierte Licht stamme von \"funkelnden Inseln in einem Meer aus ansonsten neutralem, undurchsichtigem Gas\", beschreibt der Astrophysiker. Das Weltraumteleskop sieht ihre Entstehung demnach w\u00e4hrend der Epoche der sogenannten Reionisierung, als die fr\u00fchesten Galaxien das Universum lichtdurchl\u00e4ssig gemacht haben. W\u00e4hrend dort aber Galaxien in einem sp\u00e4teren Entwicklungsstadium gefunden wurden, sehe man bei den dreien die Entstehung gewisserma\u00dfen \"live\".\nEntstehung im weitgehend lichtundurchl\u00e4ssigen Universum\nZwar sieht das Weltraumteleskop die drei Galaxien nur als \"dezente rote Flecken\", erkl\u00e4rt die NASA. Aber Spektraluntersuchungen h\u00e4tten ergeben, dass Teile des Lichts von gro\u00dfen Mengen an neutralem Wasserstoffgas absorbiert wurden. Das m\u00fcsse bei der Galaxie sehr stark verbreitet sein und einen Gro\u00dfteil davon verdecken. Dieser Fund deute darauf hin, dass wir gewisserma\u00dfen dabei zusehen, wie sich dieses neutrale Gas in Galaxien zusammenfindet, wo es abk\u00fchlt, verklumpt und neue Sterne bildet, erkl\u00e4rt Co-Autor Darach Watson. Das Team hat bereits weitere Beobachtungszeit beantragt, um herauszufinden, wo genau sich dieses Gas in den Galaxien befindet und wie urspr\u00fcnglich es genau ist.\nW\u00e4hrend der Reionisierung ist etwa 500 bis 900 Millionen Jahre nach dem Urknall jenes lichtdurchl\u00e4ssige Universum entstanden, das wir heute kennen. W\u00e4hrend dieser \"kosmischen Morgend\u00e4mmerung\" haben die ersten Sterne und Galaxien die Elektronen von den Wasserstoffkernen (den Protonen) getrennt. Die konnten dann keine Photonen (also Licht) mehr absorbieren, das Universum wurde transparent. Das Weltraumteleskop James Webb hat bereits ermittelt, dass der Hauptteil dieser Reionisierung von vergleichsweise kleinen Zwerggalaxien erledigt wurde, die wie kosmische Leuchtt\u00fcrme fungierten. Vorher war unklar, welche Strukturen die daf\u00fcr n\u00f6tige Strahlung geliefert haben und auch supermassereiche Schwarze L\u00f6cher oder gro\u00dfe Galaxien waren infrage gekommen.\nDie drei jetzt entdeckten Galaxien, die w\u00e4hrend dieser Epoche gerade entstehen, sehen wir in einem Zustand, den sie etwa 400 bis 600 Millionen Jahre nach dem Urknall einnehmen, erkl\u00e4rt die NASA.

In this blog post, we will guide you through integrating Azure API Management with Azure Active Directory B2C (AADB2C) for identity management. This integration enhances the security of your APIs by requiring user authentication before access is granted. We will break down the process into three key steps: setting up the Developer Portal to use AADB2C, configuring APIM to use OAuth 2.0 for authorization, and implementing token validation to ensure secure access.\n \nThis blog post consolidates information from three separate Microsoft Learn documents, providing a comprehensive, end-to-end guide for setting up AADB2C authentication in your APIM instance. Whether you're accessing your API via cURL, Postman, the Developer Portal, or other clients, this guide will ensure that your APIM instance is configured to handle authentication from AADB2C.\n \nPart One: Setting up Developer Portal with AADB2C\nIn this section, we will prepare the Developer Portal to use AADB2C for user authentication.\nLearning Document\n \n\nCreate Sign-Up and Sign-In Policy in AADB2C\n\nSet up a \"Sign up and sign in\" policy in AADB2C.\n\nFor this you can use the same policy for both, just create a \"Sign up and sign in\" policy in AADB2C\n \n\n\nEnsure you select all the attributes like Given Name, Surname, and return claims like Email Addresses and User's ObjectID. Here are the minimum requirements:\n\nCollect Attributes:  Given Name, Surname\nReturn claims: Given Name, Surname, Email Addresses, User's ObjectID\n \n\n\n\n\nConfigure Identity in Developer Portal\n\nAdd AADB2C as an identity provider in the Developer Portal.\n\nOpen a new tab and navigate the Azure Portal for APIM and under the Developer Portal, select Identities:\n\n\n\n\nAdd a provider by clicking the \u201cAdd\u201d button. That will prompt you with a choice of Types, you will want to select \u201cAzure Active Directory B2C\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) client library for authentication, do not worry about the rest of the attributes just yet, we will come back to them.\n\n\n\nCopy the redirect URL for the Developer Portal.\n\n     We will need this to create the backend app registration in the next step.\n\n\n\n\nCreate Backend App Registration in AADB2C\n\nRegister an app to represent your API.\n\nNow, go back to your AADB2C tab, select App Registrations from the list on the left and click \u201cNew Registration\u201d.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEnter a name for the app registration, for my example I am calling it `apim-api-backend`\nSelect the Supported account types that best fit your scenario\nSetup the redirect URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) with a Single-page application (SPA) and paste the URI you copied from above.\n\n\n\n\nClick register\n\n\nCreate a client secret for this app registration.\n\nNow that the app registration is created, you will need to create a client secret\n\nOpen the app registration you just created\nOn the overview tab, you will see the Application (client) ID, copy that for later.\n\n\n\n\nThen go to Certificates & secrets and create a new client secret. After you hit the Add button, it will show you the 'Value' of your secret. You will need to save this as it will not be shown again for security reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Identity Provider in APIM\n\nNow head back to APIM tab you left open earlier (or just open a new tab now and navigate to the APIM instance we have been working with), go to Identities, Add Identity Provider page and fill out the client id, and client secret with the values you copied from above\n\nYou will also need to fill out the Signin tenant. This is your AADB2C tenant, and it has the following format: <aadb2c-tenant-name>.onmicrosoft.com. After you fill out that text box, it should fill out the Authority for you, but if not, it is <aadb2c-tenant-name>.b2clogin.com.\nNext fill out the sign-up and sign-in policy (we created this earlier in Step 1, so go copy the name you used above), if you have the profile editing and password reset policies you can add those here as well.\nClick Add\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have created everything, you will need to republish the developer portal for these configurations to take effect.\n\n  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIt will take a few seconds for the portal to publish, but once it is complete you should be able to navigate to the Developer Portal and see a button to login using AADB2C.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTest configuration\n\nConfirm that you can successfully log into the developer portal using an AADB2C login.\n\n\n\nPart Two: Configuring APIM for OAuth 2.0 Authorization\nNow that we have AADB2C integrated as an Identity into the Developer Portal, let us configure APIM for OAuth 2.0 authorization. This will let us ensure we can send the request with an Authorization header from the developer portal.\nLearning Document\n\u00a0\n\nModify Backend App Registration\n\nAdd scopes that represent the APIs you are exposing.\n\nGo back to the AADB2C tenant and navigate to App Registrations\n\n\n\n\nFind the app you created above (this will be our backend app registration; it represents our Api) and open it up\n\n\n\n\nGo to expose an Api, and then click 'Add a scope'\n\nCreate a new scope by giving it a name, and display name and a description\nNow click 'Add Scope'\nIf this is the first scope you are adding it will ask you to create an Application ID URI, you can use the default or put your own in there it will just need to follow URI format\nHere is what the \u2018Add a scope\u2019 blade looks like\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have more than one scope you want to add, repeat these steps. The scopes will represent the things the user will be able to do from the API\n\n\nCreate a new app registration for the client (APIM Developer Portal).\n\nCreate the new app registration and give it a meaningful name, I would suggestion something with 'client' in it\nLeave the Redirect uris empty for now and select 'Register'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that the new app registration is created for the client, you will need to create a client secret like you did for the backend app registration.\n\nMake sure you copy the client id and the secret value so you can use it again when we setup the OAuth server in the next few steps.\n\n\n\n\nAllow Access to Backend App Registration\n\nIn the client app registration, add permissions to request scopes from the backend app registration.\n\nOpen the client app registration, under Api permissions, go to add a Permission\nThis will give you a list of APIs to select from, use the \u2018APIs my organization uses\u2019 filter and find the backend-app you created earlier\n\n\n\n\nSelect Delegated Permissions for all the scopes you want to add and select Add permissions\n\n\n\n\nYou will then need to grant the admin consent for these new permissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd OAuth 2.0 Auth Server in APIM\n\nConfigure OAuth 2.0 settings in APIM, providing details from app registrations.\n\nNavigate back to the APIM tab and go to the 'Oauth 2.0 + OpenID Connect' section and click the '+ Add' button under the Oauth 2.0 tab\n\n\n\n\nThis should open the 'Add OAuth2 service' dialog\n\nName:\u00a0 This will be how APIM identifies the auth server so use names appropriately\nAdd a description\nThe Client registration page URL is the page where users can create and manage their accounts, since AADB2C does not have a direct URL for that (you need to navigate via the azure portal) you can just put `http://localhost`\nNext select the Auth grant type, the default is Auth Code, but you will want to make sure to follow what you have set up in the app registrations. In my case I selected both Authorization code and Authorization code + PKCE because I set up my client app registration as a SPA. PKCE stands for Proof Key for Code Exchange\n\n\n\n\nNow enter the authorization endpoint URL, you can get this from the Endpoints page on the Overview tab of an app registration, make sure to select the v2 endpoint\n\n\n\n\nSelect POST as the auth request method\nNow enter the token endpoint URL, you can also get this from the Endpoints page on the Overview tab of an app registration.\n\n\n\n\nJust use the defaults on the 'Authorization request method\u2019 and \u2018Access token sending method\u2019.\nIn the Default scope, enter the permission that you exposed on the client app registration from the backend app registration just a few steps above this. You must use the fully qualified scope URL as the scope name here\n\nIf you have multiple scopes, you can list them all here\u2026space separated\nIt will have this format <Application ID URI>/<permission name>\n\n\nNext, fill out the clientId and clientSecret from the client app registration that you saved a moment ago\nThis will generate the Redirect URI\n\n**Important Step** You will need to go back to the client app registration and add this Redirect URI that will need to be added back to the client app registration\n\n\n\nHit Create and you are done\n\n\n\n\nNow you should have a new OAuth 2.0 server, you will need to republish the developer portal at this point to make sure the latest configuration is deployed\n\nGo back to the APIM tab and go to Portal overview, click the Revisions tab, and click the Publish button. This will take a few seconds, but you can refresh the table and see status.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\nAdd OAuth 2.0 server to your API\n\nGo to APIM and navigate to APIs -> Setting tab and then scroll down to the Security section. Select User authorization to Oauth 2.0 and then in the dropdown list select the Oauth server that we created above.\n\nIf you need to use different scopes for a given Api you can override it here at this level using the Override scope checkbox\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTest in Developer Portal\n\nLog in using AADB2C credentials in the Developer Portal.\nAccess APIs and see OAuth 2.0 authorization in action.\n\nIn the Try It section you will see something like this:\n\n\nHit the dropdown and select the grant type you setup (in our case it is authorization code)\n\nThat should trigger an auth call which will pull the token from your initial login (or prompt you for a new login) and transform it appropriately and populate the 'Authorization' header in the test request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nPart Three: Adding Token Validation for Security\nThe last step ensures secure API access by adding token validation by adding a validation policy.\nLearning Document\n\u00a0\n\nAdd Validate-JWT Policy\n\nIn APIM, add a validate-jwt policy to the inbound policy.\n\nGo to the Api you want to add the validation to, or you could set it at the global level:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nUse the `validate-jwt` policy. You can find the documentation for it here.\u00a0 This is screenshot of what it might look like, I am using `Named Values` for some variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the <openid-config URL> property with the correct AADB2C endpoint.\n\nAfter you add that policy, you will want to update the <openid-config URL> property. The format looks like this:\n\n\nhttps://<tenant-name>.b2clogin.com/<tenant-name>.onmicrosoft.com/<user-flow-name>/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration\n\n\n\nIf you want to copy and paste it, you can get this endpoint from the Endpoints section on the overview tab of the app registration. It is under the `Azure AD B2C OpenID Connect metadata document`. You will just need to fill out the policy name for you signin policy you created above.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Audience and Issuers\n\nSpecify the audience and issuers for token validation.\n\n\nTesting and Security:\n\nIf the JWT (JSON Web Token) is valid, APIM allows the request to continue to the backend.\nIf the JWT is invalid, APIM blocks the request, enhancing security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nBy following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate Azure API Management with Azure ADB2C, ensuring that your APIs are secure and accessible only to authorized users. This setup offers a robust authentication and authorization mechanism for your APIs, making them more reliable and trustworthy.", "hash": "f2d24e99fc6c318189f2243217b579764ae6e4a944ee99c6b765bd6d4d762584", "id": "3748a32a-05dd-402e-bc2c-126dc728d8c5", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/healthcare-and-life-sciences/seamless-identity-integration-azure-api-management-with-azure-ad/ba-p/4151588", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-24T13:13:33", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "439da3c6-39a5-4a96-9b8d-0a0ffb64fec1", "title": "Seamless Identity Integration: Azure API Management with Azure AD B2C (AADB2C)"}], "tags": {"AADB2C": {"name": "AADB2C", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "APIM": {"name": "APIM", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "APIs": {"name": "APIs", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "JWT": {"name": "JWT", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Microsoft Learn": {"name": "Microsoft Learn", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Password reset": {"name": "Password reset", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}, "Surname": {"name": "Surname", "tag_type": "MISC"}}, "title": "Seamless Identity Integration: Azure API Management with Azure AD B2C (AADB2C)"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-25T09:12:08.305652", "id": "b2902b88-0f63-4111-aedd-3bb132fa65ee", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "6"}, {"created": "2024-05-25T09:11:26.595967", "id": "ebaded79-604e-4c84-8347-44156dd12ba0", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-24T13:11:17", "id": "a186710b-4ee4-4b13-8daf-a4f0255253e9", "news_items": [{"author": "Editor", "content": "UK authorities are reportedly planning to make it mandatory for ransomware victims to report incidents to the government and obtain a license before making ransom payments.

It is effectively a social security number which is used as an identifier when paying taxes, receiving social security and healthcare.\nAs such, it is clearly not the kind of information that you would like to fall into the hands of unauthorised parties - such as identity thieves.\nIf a data breach occurs in the Netherlands, the Dutch data protection authority should be notified within 72 hours, and victims informed as soon as possible. However, in this breach's case it appears that did not happen.\nA spokesperson for the municipality of Eindhoven claimed that \"very quick action\" was taken after the discovery of the breach, and that affected residents were not informed of the breach because the risk of identity theft had been rated as \"unlikely.\"\nUltimately, details of the data breach only became public in recent days - many months after the breach occurred.\nThe municipality has emphasised that the data leak had been internal, and that the sensitive information has not been accessible to outsiders.\nAlthough it's good news if the data leak did not spill out to the outside world, what isn't clear from the report is just how many internal employees at the municipality were able to access the sensitive data without authorisation.\nFurthermore, it is not apparent what investigations might have taken place to explore what internal staff may have done with the breached data to which they had access.\nSince last year, the municipality of Eindhoven has been the subject of stricter supervision by the Dutch data protection authority, concerned that personal data has not been handled with enough care following some 200 other breaches of varying size and severity.\nData breaches can have serious consequences for both municipalities and the individuals whose data is compromised. It is essential that municipalities take care to ensure that personal information is not unwittingly exposed, and that steps are taken to protect systems and data from unauthorised access.\nUnlike with companies, members of the public have no choice but to entrust their personal information with municipalities in order to access essential services. Data breaches of public bodies violate this trust and expose sensitive information that could be used for malicious purposes by criminals.\ntags\nGraham Cluley is an award-winning security blogger, researcher and public speaker.

The relentless pace of technological advancements and the continuous evolution of cyber threats demand that security leaders stay ahead through constant innovation and rigorous training. Among the most promising advancements are artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies, which have shown great potential in enabling Security Operations Center (SOC) teams to outpace adversaries. However, integrating these new technologies effectively, without incurring significant operational overheads or introducing unknown risks, remains a significant challenge.\nThe Race to Reduce Attack Dwell Time\nAttack dwell time, the interval between an initial breach and its detection, is a crucial metric in cybersecurity. The longer attackers go undetected, the more damage they can inflict. Reducing attack dwell time is therefore essential. Despite recent advancements in TDIR capabilities, adversaries are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often achieving their objectives faster than security teams can detect and respond to their activities. This underscores the need for even faster and more effective detection and response mechanisms.\nThe Challenges of SIEM, SOAR, and Data Detection Siloes\nTraditional Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms have been instrumental in advancing TDIR capabilities. However, these systems often operate within isolated data siloes, leading to fragmented visibility and delayed responses. SIEM systems, though powerful in aggregating and analyzing security data, can be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of alerts, leading to alert fatigue among SOC teams. SOAR platforms, while excellent at automating responses, require extensive integration and fine-tuning to function optimally, which can be resource intensive.\nCISO Guide to TDIR Innovation with XDR, AI, and Automation\nTo address these challenges and to harness the full potential of AI and security automation, Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platforms have emerged as a comprehensive solution. XDR consolidates data from across the entire security stack, breaking down siloes and providing a holistic view of threats. This integration enables faster, more accurate detection and response, leveraging the vigor of AI and automation to enhance TDIR processes.\nTo delve deeper into these innovations, CISOs and security leaders are invited to an upcoming webinar titled \u201cCISO Guide to TDIR Innovation with XDR, AI, and Automation,\u201d presented by Eric Parizo, Omdia\u2019s Managing Principal Analyst for Enterprise Cybersecurity Operations (SecOps). Scheduled for Wednesday, May 29th at 9 am PST, this session will provide invaluable insights into the future of TDIR.\nWebinar Highlights\nDuring the online event, attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of how AI and automation can revolutionize security operations. Key takeaways will include:\nEnhancing Security Through AI and Automation: Discover how AI algorithms can rapidly analyze vast amounts of data to identify anomalies and potential threats, significantly reducing the time and effort required for detection and response. Automation can handle routine tasks, allowing human analysts to focus on more complex issues.\n-\nXDR as a Force Multiplier: Learn how XDR platforms, when integrated with AI and automation, can serve as a powerful multiplier for TDIR programs. XDR\u2019s ability to aggregate and correlate data from multiple sources provides a unified view of the threat landscape, enabling more efficient and effective responses.\n-\nCross-Layered Approach Benefits: Understand the advantages of a comprehensive, cross-layered approach that consolidates the entire security stack. This strategy not only enhances visibility and control but also streamlines operations, reducing the complexity and cost associated with managing disparate security tools.\n-\nPractical Insights and Exclusive Resources\nIn addition to these insights, registrants will be the first to receive a new Omdia white paper that delves into the intricacies of TDIR innovation with XDR, AI, and automation. This resource will provide practical guidance on implementing these technologies, highlighting best practices and common pitfalls to avoid.\nConclusion\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, so too must the strategies and technologies used to combat them.

While other animals such as honeybees have shown an ability to understand numbers, this specific manifestation of numeric literacy has not yet been observed in any other non-human species. \"Producing a specific number of vocalizations with purpose requires a sophisticated combination of numerical abilities and vocal control,\" writes the team of researchers led by neuroscientist Diana Liao of the University of Tubingen in Germany. \"Whether this capacity exists in animals other than humans is yet unknown.

Zwei Jugendliche sollen in Deutschland bei diesen Mutproben gestorben sein.\nSucht man bei Tiktok nach den Challenges, f\u00e4llt auf, dass es vor allem Videos gibt, die jeweils davor warnen. Videos von den tats\u00e4chlichen Mutproben findet man auf Anhieb nicht. Allerdings k\u00f6nnen selbst solche Warnungen zum Ausprobieren f\u00fchren, ganze ohne Nachmachen. Videos k\u00f6nnen privat verschickt werden, sodass die eigentliche Challenge auch gar nicht unbedingt auf der Plattform direkt stattfinden muss. Sucht man bei Instagram nach dem Hashtag Blackout-Challenge, findet man nahezu identische Inhalte.\nTiktok betont immer wieder, dass sie solche Challenges nicht auf der Plattform haben wollen. Man reagiere zudem immer wieder mit Warnhinweisen und versuche die Videos auszusortieren. heise online hat bei Tiktok nach einem Statement zu dem j\u00fcngsten Vorfall gefragt.\n(emw)", "hash": "6766e09c1bead606b44b28e4e28af21507b56d87ac39ab71207b6a9d3afd5ca5", "id": "da6a2b25-4d78-4ea9-8fcb-6cbfcaedb292", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Tiktok-Blackout-Challenge-13-Jaehrige-aus-Hessen-gestorben-9731158.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-24T12:49:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "2f4f386e-e017-4cd5-b906-0840187a11ea", "title": "Blackout-Challenge bei Tiktok: 13-J\u00e4hrige aus Hessen stirbt"}], "tags": {"Deutschland": {"name": "Deutschland", "tag_type": "Country"}, "FFH": {"name": "FFH", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Hessen": {"name": "Hessen", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Kassel": {"name": "Kassel", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "TikTok": {"name": "TikTok", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Tiktok-Challenges": {"name": "Tiktok-Challenges", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "USA": {"name": "USA", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "emw": {"name": "emw", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Blackout-Challenge bei Tiktok: 13-J\u00e4hrige aus Hessen stirbt"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T17:08:53.679847", "id": "3da090fc-33fd-4174-95dd-f1c54a29c3be", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}, {"created": "2024-05-24T17:16:05.551156", "id": "507c3365-b6c4-4738-94e8-2c75b0c7284b", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "6"}], "created": "2024-05-24T12:47:59", "id": "e1c8dff8-70b1-43ee-bf54-851954352ef1", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Facebook \u00e4ndert Richtlinien wegen KI: Was ihr dazu wissen m\u00fcsst\nDie zum Konzern Meta geh\u00f6renden Online-Netzwerk Facebook und Instagram informieren Nutzer*innen derzeit \u00fcber eine bevorstehende Richtlinien-\u00c4nderung.

Zuletzt waren russische Angriffe darauf wohl immer erfolgreicher.\nIm Rahmen der j\u00fcngsten Offensive beim Angriffskrieg gegen die Ukraine gelingt es russischen Truppen zunehmend, das Satelliteninternet Starlink stark zu st\u00f6ren. Das berichtet die New York Times unter Berufung auf mehrere ukrainische Soldaten und den Digitalminister sowie Vizepremier Mychajlo Fedorow. Nachdem der Dienst des US-Konzerns SpaceX bislang bemerkenswert stabil gewesen sei, k\u00f6nne das russische Milit\u00e4r die Ukraine inzwischen immer besser von dem wichtigen Kommunikationsmittel abschneiden. Wie genau, dar\u00fcber kann demnach wohl nur spekuliert werden. Man sei im stetigen Austausch mit SpaceX, versichert Fedorow demnach noch und gibt sich \u00fcberzeugt, dass die Verf\u00fcgbarkeit bald wieder verbessert werden kann.\n\"Alles wurde komplizierter\"\nWie die US-Zeitung zusammengetragen hat, erfolgten die umfangreichen Unterbrechungen an dem Frontabschnitt, einen Tag bevor dort die j\u00fcngste russische Offensive begann. Das sei vor allem f\u00fcr die Drohnenstreitkr\u00e4fte zum Problem geworden, die f\u00fcr die Kommunikation besonders stark auf Starlink angewiesen sind. Das Satelliteninternet ist demnach nicht komplett ausgefallen, die Verbindungen wurden aber extrem langsam. Teilweise h\u00e4tten die Soldaten auf Messenger ausweichen m\u00fcssen, um wenigstens Textnachrichten austauschen zu k\u00f6nnen. Aber auch diese Nachrichten seien ausgebremst worden. Inzwischen hat man sich wohl teilweise darauf eingestellt, die St\u00f6rungen w\u00fcrden aber alles komplizierter und zeitaufw\u00e4ndiger machen.\nWas genau hinter den russischen St\u00f6rma\u00dfnahmen steckt, sei unklar. Vorstellbar seien laut einer US-Expertin f\u00fcr elektronische Kriegsf\u00fchrung Angriffe mit besonders starken Radiosignalen, die die Verbindungen zu den Satelliten unterbrechen. Daf\u00fcr seien typischerweise gro\u00dfe Antennen n\u00f6tig. M\u00f6glich ist dem Bericht zufolge aber auch, dass das russische Milit\u00e4r mit Drohnen die GPS-Empf\u00e4nger in den Starlink-Antennen st\u00f6rt. Dann k\u00f6nnten sie sich dann nicht mehr mit der n\u00f6tigen Pr\u00e4zision auf die Internetsatelliten ausrichten. Von welchen Gegenma\u00dfnahmen sich die ukrainische Regierung eine Besserung der Situation erhofft, geht aus dem Bericht nicht hervor. Zuletzt sind Russland bei der Offensive nur noch kleine Gel\u00e4ndegewinne gelungen, hei\u00dft es etwa vom britischen Verteidigungsministerium.\nDie Schwierigkeiten unterstreichen einmal mehr, welche Probleme die gro\u00dfe Abh\u00e4ngigkeit der Ukraine von Starlink mit sich bringen kann. Es gebe aber wenig vergleichbare Alternativen, versicherte Fedorow demnach. Starlink war in der Ukraine unmittelbar nach der umfangreichen Invasion Russlands im Fr\u00fchjahr 2022 freigeschaltet worden. Nach dem anf\u00e4nglichen Enthusiasmus hat sich Elon Musk immer kritischer zu der Rolle ge\u00e4u\u00dfert, die die Technik auch milit\u00e4risch spielt. Zitate aus der Biografie Elon Musks von Walter Isaacson legen nahe, dass sich Musk der strategischen Bedeutung von Starlink sehr lange nicht bewusst war. Eine Machtf\u00fclle wie die des Milliard\u00e4rs ist in der Geschichte der Vereinigten Staaten ohne Beispiel.\n(mho)", "hash": "f67ef05669b02f5aa0c35c4df004027e9c21eadb58da3ec7aa85f183d4f3c68d", "id": "22a630ec-3487-42b0-b6e9-803561a36bb3", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Ukraine-Krieg-Russisches-Militaer-kann-Starlink-immer-umfangreicher-stoeren-9730840.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-24T12:29:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "35c5bfc5-4924-4de6-bd1a-aff8bb5338b8", "title": "Ukraine-Krieg: Russisches Milit\u00e4r kann Starlink immer umfangreicher st\u00f6ren"}], "tags": {"Elon Musk": {"name": "Elon Musk", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Elon Musks": {"name": "Elon Musks", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Fedorow": {"name": "Fedorow", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Mychajlo Fedorow": {"name": "Mychajlo Fedorow", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Russland": {"name": "Russland", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Russlands": {"name": "Russlands", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "SpaceX": {"name": "SpaceX", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Ukraine": {"name": "Ukraine", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Vereinigten Staaten": {"name": "Vereinigten Staaten", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Walter Isaacson": {"name": "Walter Isaacson", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Ukraine-Krieg: Russisches Milit\u00e4r kann Starlink immer umfangreicher st\u00f6ren"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T17:16:05.781784", "id": "4c387612-9745-4803-bb04-95b6358c49c9", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "8"}], "created": "2024-05-24T12:07:00", "id": "56e8403d-f7f8-4779-8223-b074d1c93b98", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "L\u00e4ngster Konsolenkrieg der Geschichte zu Ende: Atari kauft Intellivision\nVergangenes Jahr wurde bekannt, dass der Konsolenhersteller Intellivision in Schwierigkeiten geraten ist.

Die Intellivision-Spiele f\u00fcr die Konsole, an denen nach der \u00dcbernahme Atari die Rechte hat, wird Atari per Lizenz zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen - sollte Amico tats\u00e4chlich jemals erscheinen.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Fans rasten aus: EA zeigt Werbung mitten im Videospiel\nKommentare", "hash": "537a4ac7b036ddb8ba140860926eb4d6850d45235361e54d2c1f5d87bebb1ea4", "id": "0c02bc8d-5417-4464-a5ec-15ba4e1f4605", "link": "https://futurezone.at/b2b/konsolenkrieg-atari-intellivision-amico-uebernahme-gaming-retro/402904273", "osint_source_id": "eec2ad26-2f4c-4dd8-a3e5-08c0eb3765ca", "published": "2024-05-24T12:07:00", "source": "https://futurezone.at/xml/rss", "story_id": "56e8403d-f7f8-4779-8223-b074d1c93b98", "title": "L\u00e4ngster Konsolenkrieg der Geschichte zu Ende: Atari kauft Intellivision"}], "tags": {"Amico": {"name": "Amico", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Atari": {"name": "Atari", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Mattel": {"name": "Mattel", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Mike Mika": {"name": "Mike Mika", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Nintendo": {"name": "Nintendo", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Sega": {"name": "Sega", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "VCS": {"name": "VCS", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Wade Rosen": {"name": "Wade Rosen", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "L\u00e4ngster Konsolenkrieg der Geschichte zu Ende: Atari kauft Intellivision"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T17:35:30.668889", "id": "633c3ad2-20ea-473e-a104-238c037832e1", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "5"}, {"created": "2024-05-24T17:10:55.163285", "id": "af74e086-c8d8-4ea4-bf8d-61db8366cccd", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-24T12:06:00", "id": "4d1aa393-91d8-41d7-b0a1-ff52951cbdfe", "news_items": [{"author": "Oliver B\u00fcnte", "content": "Britische Streitkr\u00e4fte lassen Funkwellenkanone gegen Drohnen entwickeln\nDrohnen will das Britische Verteidigungsministerium k\u00fcnftig mit einer Strahlenwaffe elektronisch bek\u00e4mpfen. Das System ist pro Schuss sehr g\u00fcnstig.\nDas Vereinigte K\u00f6nigreich beabsichtigt, seine Drohnenabwehr mit einer Funkwellenkanone zu verst\u00e4rken. Das teilte das britische Verteidigungsministerium bereits Mitte Mai mit. Das als \"Radio Frequency Directed Energy Weapon\" (RFDEW) bezeichnete Waffensystem soll die Elektronik gegnerischer Drohnen auf eine Entfernung von bis zu einem Kilometer ausschalten k\u00f6nnen. Auch die Bek\u00e4mpfung mehrerer Drohnen zugleich soll das Waffensystem erm\u00f6glichen.\nDas RFDEW ist eine auf Funkfrequenzen ausgerichtete Energiewaffe, schreibt das Verteidigungsministerium in einer Mitteilung. Es soll eine Reihe verschiedener Bedrohungen durch bewaffnete, gegnerische Drohnensysteme zu Lande, zu Wasser und in der Luft bek\u00e4mpfen k\u00f6nnen, so die Zielsetzung. Darunter fallen auch bewaffnete Kleinstdrohnen, wie sie derzeit etwa im russischen Angriffskrieg gegen die Ukraine eingesetzt werden. Dabei sei das System dann in der Lage, Ziele in einer Entfernung bis zu einem Kilometer zu erfassen, zu verfolgen und zu bek\u00e4mpfen. Es werde allerdings daran gearbeitet, die Reichweite weiter zu erh\u00f6hen. Da das RFDEW weitgehend automatisiert agieren kann, wird f\u00fcr den Betrieb lediglich ein Soldat ben\u00f6tigt.\nDer dahintersteckende Wirkmechanismus ist vergleichsweise einfach: Radiowellen st\u00f6ren die kritischen elektronischen Komponenten oder besch\u00e4digen sie. Drohnen, egal ob zu Lande, zu Wasser oder in der Luft, bleiben dann kampfunf\u00e4hig stehen oder fallen vom Himmel herunter.\nDer Preis pro Schuss sei sensationell g\u00fcnstig. Rund zehn Britische Pence pro Schuss w\u00fcrden f\u00e4llig werden. Das ist im Vergleich zu raketenbasierten Flugabwehrsystemen zur Bek\u00e4mpfung von Drohnen extrem preisg\u00fcnstig.\nMobil einsetzbares Waffensystem\nDas RFDEW-System k\u00f6nne auf verschiedene Milit\u00e4rfahrzeuge aufgesetzt werden. Zum Einsatz komme eine mobile Energiequelle. Sie befeuert dann die Funkwellenkanone, die einen Strahl erzeugt, sodass schnell aufeinanderfolgende Sch\u00fcsse auf einzelne Ziele abgefeuert werden k\u00f6nnen. Der Strahl k\u00f6nne auch erweitert werden, um mehrere Ziele zugleich bek\u00e4mpfen zu k\u00f6nnen.\nEntwickelt wird das RFDEW-System von dem Team des Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) und dem Defence Equipment & Support (DE&S). Beide arbeiten dabei im Projekt Hersa eng mit der britischen Industrie zusammen. Geplant ist nach Aussage des britischen Verteidigungsministeriums, im Sommer 2024 erste Feldtests mit dem Waffensystem durchzuf\u00fchren.\nLesen Sie auch\nLaserkanone schie\u00dft Drohnen ab\n(olb)", "hash": "31a5d76c9d716046f18e4b1a6827f5f4a6a759c68658614b9a9eff4b99919b29", "id": "f4f6bd6c-3f95-4797-a5c4-6436bd14e7d3", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Britische-Streitkraefte-lassen-Funkwellenkanone-gegen-Drohnen-entwickeln-9730639.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-24T12:06:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "4d1aa393-91d8-41d7-b0a1-ff52951cbdfe", "title": "Britische Streitkr\u00e4fte lassen Funkwellenkanone gegen Drohnen entwickeln"}], "tags": {"DSTL": {"name": "DSTL", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Defence Equipment & Support": {"name": "Defence Equipment & Support", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Mobil": {"name": "Mobil", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "RFDEW": {"name": "RFDEW", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Ukraine": {"name": "Ukraine", "tag_type": "Country"}}, "title": "Britische Streitkr\u00e4fte lassen Funkwellenkanone gegen Drohnen entwickeln"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T17:24:12.334248", "id": "be8cbec4-e302-4f8e-b78c-bfd27b2c33e2", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "18"}, {"created": "2024-05-24T17:12:53.543188", "id": "eb4a52aa-58a1-4d9f-8a99-7f0700c68878", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "4"}], "created": "2024-05-24T12:05:43", "id": "51d6962d-f83a-426a-98a3-e83f06c68435", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "EU wants universities to work with intelligence agencies to protect their research\nEurope\u2019s leading research universities should work more closely with the continent\u2019s intelligence agencies to help secure their research from being stolen by hostile states, EU member states recommended this week.\nThe risks of \u201cundesirable transfer of knowledge, foreign interference, and ethical or integrity violations\u201d have been increasingly stressed in recent years following major espionage efforts believed to be sponsored by the Chinese state.\nA recommendation adopted by EU member states on Thursday aims to \u201caddress research security risks deriving from international cooperation,\u201d and highlights the sensitivities around frontier technologies.\nTechnology areas including \u201cadvanced semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum and biotechnologies\u201d are assessed as particularly critical for the European Union\u2019s economic security.\nOne of the key recommendations adopted by the Council this week includes facilitating information exchange between research organizations and intelligence services \u201cfor example through classified and non-classified briefings or dedicated liaison officers\u201d so they can keep abreast of the risks facing research in these areas.\nAnother recommendation calls for an increased political focus on the challenges that intellectual property theft and knowledge transfer can pose, with member states being asked to \u201cdevelop or reinforce cross-sectoral cooperation within government, notably bringing together policy-makers responsible for higher education, research and innovation, trade, foreign affairs, intelligence and security.\u201d\nThe proposals come amid an increasing recognition of the threat in the West, with the head of Britain\u2019s domestic intelligence agency warning university heads in April that they were being targeted by foreign states.\nAmong the measures being considered by the British government is having MI5, the domestic security service, carry out security vetting on key researchers involved in a \u201csmall proportion of academic work, with a particular focus on research with potential dual uses in civilian and military life.\u201d\nSuch vetting may make it possible for senior officials to receive intelligence briefings from the security services to help them keep their institutions safe.\nA similar program is in place in the United States, where the National Counterintelligence and Security Center\u2019s Safeguarding Science initiative attempts to help the research community \u201cdesign measures to guard against the potential misuse or theft\u201d of key technologies.\nAlongside the persistent threat from China, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, experts warned Western companies to be on \u201cfull alert\u201d for cyberattacks from Moscow\u2019s intelligence services engaging in industrial espionage.\nAt the time, Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House's Russia and Eurasia Programme \u2014 who was himself the target of an attempted hack-and-leak attack conducted by a group attributed to the Russian security services \u2014 said there was a sense the West has forgotten how active the Russian intelligence services used to be in this space.\n\u201cWhile we are open to knowledge exchange and international cooperation in the field of research, we should not be na\u00efve.

Er erh\u00f6ht die Performance und erlaubt k\u00fcnftig eine schnellere Feature-Entwicklung.\nDas Softwareunternehmen JetBrains hat seine Programmiersprache Kotlin in Version 2.0 ver\u00f6ffentlicht. Das Major Release bringt die stabile Version des neuen K2-Compilers mit, der von Grund auf mit Blick auf die Multiplattform-Entwicklung erstellt wurde und zweimal schneller kompilieren soll. Weitere Highlights sind das standardm\u00e4\u00dfige Generieren von Lambda-Funktionen per invokedynamic\nund die Stabilisierung der Library kotlinx-metadata-jvm\n.\nK2-Compiler f\u00fcr Multiplattform-Einsatz, h\u00f6here Performance und schnellere Feature-Entwicklung\nBesonderes Augenmerk hat JetBrains auf den neuen Kotlin- und JVM-Compiler K2 gelegt. Die Arbeiten daran begannen bereits 2021, bevor er in Kotlin 1.9.20 Ende des vergangenen Jahres zun\u00e4chst den Beta-Status f\u00fcr alle Plattformen erreichte und nun in Kotlin 2.0 wie geplant als stabiles Feature vorliegt.\nDer K2-Compiler ist auf Multiplattform-Entwicklung ausgerichtet, indem er alle Plattformen vereinigt, mit denen Kotlin umgehen kann. Dadurch kann das Kotlin-Team die meisten Features, \u00c4nderungen und Bugfixes mit einem Mal f\u00fcr alle Plattformen anbringen. Das soll das Entwickeln neuer Sprachfeatures stark beschleunigen.\nZudem soll K2 deutliche Performance-Vorteile bringen: Der neue Compiler soll im Vergleich zu fr\u00fcheren Kotlin-Versionen ein doppelt so schnelles Kompilieren erm\u00f6glichen. Wie Entwicklerinnen und Entwickler die Kompilierungsgeschwindigkeit ihrer Projekte selbst messen k\u00f6nnen, zeigt ein Blogeintrag. Die neue Architektur soll zudem weitere Verbesserungen der Kompilierungszeit f\u00fcr Multiplattform-Projekte vereinfachen.\nDar\u00fcber hinaus ebnet der K2-Compiler den Weg f\u00fcr Neuerungen, die \u00fcber die Kompilierung hinausgehen. So arbeitet das Entwicklungsteam bereits an der n\u00e4chsten Generation des Formats f\u00fcr die KMP-Libraries-Distribution. Sie soll unter anderem das Entwickeln und Ver\u00f6ffentlichen von KMP-Bibliotheken von einem beliebigen Host und universellen Kotlin-Bibliotheken erm\u00f6glichen. Bei KMP handelt es sich um Kotlin Multiplatform, JetBrains' aktuelles Steckenpferd zum Entwickeln f\u00fcr Android, iOS, Desktop und das Web mit Kotlin \u2013 als Konkurrenz zu etablierten Frameworks wie Flutter oder React Native.\nNeues f\u00fcr Lambda-Funktionen und Bin\u00e4rdatei-Metadaten\nEin weiteres stabilisiertes Feature ist die Bibliothek kotlinx-metadata-jvm\n. Sie ist zum kotlin\n-Paket umgezogen und nun (ohne \"x\") unter kotlin-metadata-jvm\nzu finden. Die Bibliothek stellt eine API bereit, um Metadaten von Bin\u00e4rdateien, die der Kotlin/JVM-Compiler generiert hat, zu lesen und zu bearbeiten. Bisher verfolgte die Bibliothek ihr eigenes Ver\u00f6ffentlichungsschema und ihre eigene Nummerierung. Nun ist sie Teil des Kotlin-Releasezyklus und bietet die gleiche Garantie der Abw\u00e4rtskompatibilit\u00e4t wie die Kotlin Standard Library.\nDer Umgang mit Lambda-Funktionen hat sich in Kotlin 2.0 ebenfalls ver\u00e4ndert: Sie werden jetzt standardm\u00e4\u00dfig per invokedynamic\ngeneriert, was optional bereits seit Kotlin 1.5 durch die Compiler-Option -Xlambdas=indy\nm\u00f6glich war. Das soll die Bin\u00e4rgr\u00f6\u00dfen von Anwendungen im Vergleich zur traditionellen, anonymen Klassengeneration verkleinern.\nVerglichen mit der herk\u00f6mmlichen Lambda-Kompilierung hat die neue Vorgehensweise allerdings drei Einschr\u00e4nkungen:\nEin in invokedynamic\nkompiliertes Lambda ist nicht serialisierbar.\n-\nDie experimentelle reflect()\n-API kann nicht mit Lambdas umgehen, die durchinvokedynamic\nerstellt wurden.\n-\nDer Aufruf von .toString()\nauf ein solches Lambda f\u00fchrt zu einer schlechter lesbaren String-Repr\u00e4sentation.\n-\nUm das Legacy-Verhalten wiederherzustellen, lassen sich entweder spezifische Lambdas mit @JvmSerializableLambda\nannotieren oder die Compiler-Option -Xlambdas=class\nverwenden, um das Verhalten auf alle Lambdas in einem Modul anzuwenden.\nAlle weiteren Details zu Kotlin 2.0 finden Interessierte im JetBrains-Blog und auf der \"What's new\"-Webseite.\n(mai)", "hash":

After an in-depth analysis, we found that the issue could be related to the server running the application, including resources assigned, network issues, etc.,. Aside from other tools offered by Azure, following, I would like to share the lessons learned using logman that is part of performance monitor tool (perfmon). \n \nTools Overview\nperfmon\nThe Performance Monitor (perfmon) is a Windows tool that provides a visual interface for monitoring system performance. It can track various performance metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, disk activity, and network activity in real-time.\nlogman\nlogman is a command-line tool in Windows that allows you to create and manage performance data collection sets. It can be used to automate the collection of performance data, making it an excellent tool for scheduled and long-term monitoring.\n \nStep-by-Step Guide\n \nStep 1: Create a Data Collector Set with logman\nThe following script shows how to create a data collector set using logman, configure it to collect various performance counters, and store the data in a CSV file.\n \nSave this script as a Windows Command Batch file (.cmd) and execute it as Administrator:\n \nlogman create counter MyDataCollector -f csv -o \"C:\\Counters\\MyDataCollector\"\nlogman update MyDataCollector -c \"\\Memory\\Available MBytes\"\nlogman update MyDataCollector -c \"\\TCP(*)\\*\"\nlogman update MyDataCollector -c \"\\Network Interface(*)\\*\"\nlogman update MyDataCollector -c \"\\Process(*)\\*\"\nlogman update MyDataCollector -c \"\\Process(_Total)\\*\"\nlogman update MyDataCollector -c \"\\Processor Information(*)\\*\"\nlogman update MyDataCollector -c \"\\Processor(_Total)\\*\"\nlogman update MyDataCollector -c \"\\Processor(0)\\*\"\nlogman update MyDataCollector -si 00:00:05\nlogman start MyDataCollector\ntimeout /t 30\nlogman stop MyDataCollector\nlogman delete MyDataCollector\n \n \nOnce the application finished, I checked the CSV file generated and found useful information saved in this file, such as network activity, process activity, and resource usage. In this case, we have generated the file C:\\Counters\\MyDataCollector_000001.csv\n \n\n \nStep 2: Import Data into Power BI\nOnce the data is collected and saved in a CSV file, you can import it into Power BI for analysis.\n\nOpen Power BI Desktop.\nGet Data:\n\nClick on \"Get Data\" and select \"Text/CSV\".\nBrowse to C:\\Counters\\MyDataCollector_000001.csv and import the file.\n\n\nTransform Data:\n\nPower BI will load a preview of the data. Click on \"Transform Data\" to clean and format the data if necessary.\nYou might want to rename columns, change data types, or filter out unnecessary data.\n\n\nCreate Visualizations:\n\nOnce the data is loaded, you can start creating visualizations. Use charts, graphs, and tables to analyze the performance data.\nFor example, you can create line charts to visualize memory usage over time, bar charts for network traffic, and pie charts for process usage.\n\n\n\n \nDisclaimer\n \nThe use of this application and the provided scripts is intended for educational and informational purposes only.

Neben einem \"frischeren Look-and-feel\" soll das auch die Bedienung vereinfachen.\nAm Beispiel des eingebauten Passwortgenerators lassen sich bereits die wichtigsten Unterschiede erkennen.\nDie Bedienoberfl\u00e4che setzt auf neue Farbschemen, aktualisierte Zeichens\u00e4tze und einem saubereren, strafferen Layout. Das wirkt insgesamt moderner, schreiben die Bitwarden-Entwickler in einem Blog-Beitrag.\nBitwarden mit verbesserter Navigation\nDie Navigation und Informationsarchitektur sei \u00fcberarbeitet worden, um die Nutzererfahrung zu verbessern. Schl\u00fcsselfunktionen und -aktionen w\u00fcrden etwas prominenter angezeigt, damit sie leichter auffindbar seien. Beim Hinzuf\u00fcgen neuer Eintr\u00e4ge wurde der Hinzuf\u00fcgen-Knopf nach oben verschoben und ist nun ein ausklappendes Men\u00fc, um die unterschiedlichen Eintragsarten (Log-ins, Visitenkarten, Identit\u00e4ten oder Notizen) direkt ausw\u00e4hlen zu k\u00f6nnen. Das erspare einige Klicks.\nAber auch am obigen Passwortgenerator-Beispiel l\u00e4sst sich die Vereinfachung erkennen. Ob ein Passwort, Nutzername oder Passphrase erstellt werden soll, l\u00e4sst sich aus einer \u00fcbersichtlicheren und platzsparenden Leiste ausw\u00e4hlen. Tiefer Scrollen kann so \u00f6fter unn\u00f6tig werden.\nAuch die Eintragdetails wurden gestrafft. Das Formular gruppiere nun verwandte Felder und eindeutigen Sektions\u00fcberschriften. Bezeichnungen haben die Programmierer vereinfacht \u2013 aus dem technischen Begriff URI wurde etwa Website. Die Bitwarden-Entwickler erhoffen sich dadurch, neuen Nutzerinnen und Nutzern den Einstieg zu erleichtern und ein besseres Erlebnis f\u00fcr existierende Bitwarden-Nutzer zu liefern. Die Reiter \"Tab\" und \"Tresor\" zieht die neue Fassung unter \"Vault\" (Tresor) zusammen, was die Suche und den Zugriff konsistenter machen soll. Die Filter sollen sich durch die direkte Integration in die neue Tresor-Ansicht besser nutzen lassen.\nEs handele sich bei dem Redesign um einen fortw\u00e4hrenden Prozess, schreiben die Entwickler. Die bisher gezeigten Screenshots stellen einen Schnappschuss dar, der in den \"kommenden Monaten\" mit Updates verteilt werden soll. Bitwarden hat eine Umfrage erstellt, in der das Unternehmen Interessierte \u00fcber ihre Meinung zu den Design-\u00c4nderungen befragt.\nDer Passwort-Manager Bitwarden hat zuletzt etwa die Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr Passkeys erhalten, die die Entwickler auch gleich verbesserten. K\u00fcrzlich hat Bitwarden auch einen Standalone-Authenticator ver\u00f6ffentlicht, sodass die zeitbasierten Einmalkennw\u00f6rter nicht unbedingt \u00fcber die Apps der Konzerne Google oder Microsoft erstellt werden m\u00fcssen. Die k\u00f6nnen die geheimen Seeds in die Cloud hochladen f\u00fcr eine dezentrale Nutzung, was f\u00fcr einige Nutzer ein zu gro\u00dfes Risiko darstellt.\n(dmk)", "hash": "4ed456c757393bfae29c29206e773994e4397e182636224529a7f3b4b8e71d5b", "id": "d4baa303-6388-4a34-9971-06476a28fd82", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Bitwarden-ueberarbeitet-Browser-Erweiterungen-9730858.html?wt_mc=rss.red.security.security.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "c2c6d572-40f6-4271-ade8-596b8f44c6bb", "published": "2024-05-24T11:57:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/security/rss/news-atom.xml", "story_id": "88a4f843-8be7-4485-9275-c628ff1e7b5a", "title": "Bitwarden \u00fcberarbeitet Browser-Erweiterungen"}], "tags": {"Bitwarden": {"name": "Bitwarden", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Microsoft": {"name": "Microsoft", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "URI": {"name": "URI", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "Bitwarden \u00fcberarbeitet Browser-Erweiterungen"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T17:22:04.795995", "id": "2adbe472-3498-4d40-9063-384c9d367767", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-24T11:57:00", "id": "1b23c956-73bf-4d37-bd24-cdfe2363e592", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Der US-Ladestationsbetreiber FLO hat begonnen, seine neuen Ultra-DC-Schnelllader aus der Fabrik in Michigan auszurollen.

Al Serr had created a telemedicine WhatsApp group where he and Osaid, a surgical resident in the U.S., recruited doctors from stateside, the U.K., and Europe to give advice to their overstretched colleagues in Gaza.\n\u201cHe reported on a gunshot injury in a 70-year old,\u201d Osaid said, of Al Serr. \u201cIt was in her head. And really, there were no neurosurgeons at that time.\u201d\n\u201cHe was sharing those cases, and he was asking for help,\u201d Osaid went on. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Is there any neurosurgeon that can help me? How can I fix this?\u2019\u201d\nAl Serr was a natural vessel for the collective medical knowledge of the group chat. \u201cHe always wanted to help out, always liked to use his hands, to kind of fix a problem and have an immediate impact,\u201d according to Osaid.\nIn February, the Israeli military invaded Nasser Hospital. The attack left the hospital hollowed out, just one of the destroyed health care centers in a medical system savaged by an overwhelming caseload and a relentless military assault by Israel.\nStill, Al Serr maintained some optimism. His last post on Instagram was uploaded in mid-March, a short video showing the exterior of the hospital from the day before, captioned with a triumphant message:\nFinally!! After more than a month of cutting electricity in Naser hospital, our staff was able to fix the generator and get the electricity again to Nasser Hospital. For the last two weeks, we are trying to clean and prepare the hospital\u2019s departments to reopen the hospital again.\nSix days later, on March 24, Israeli forces stormed the hospital again. Osaid had asked a few days earlier if Al Serr was alright. No response ever came. It was their last exchange.\nHis relatives believe that Khaled Al Serr, along with what was left of the hospital\u2019s dwindling staff, was taken prisoner by Israel.\nAs early as November, reports emerged of doctors being detained and going missing in north Gaza. According to the World Health Organization, at least 214 medical staff from Gaza have been detained by the Israeli military. In early May, the detention and alleged torture of medical staff from Gaza made headlines when Israeli authorities announced the death of Adnan Al-Bursh, a well-known surgeon and the head of orthopedics at Al-Shifa Hospital. After being taken into custody in December, officials said Al-Bursh died in April while in Ofer Prison, an Israeli detention facility in the occupied West Bank.\n\u201cDr. Adnan\u2019s case raises serious concerns that he died following torture at the hands of Israeli authorities. His death demands an independent international investigation,\u201d Tlaleng Mofokeng, the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to health, said in a statement last week. \u201cThe killing and detention of healthcare workers is not a legitimate method of warfare. They have a legitimate and essential role to care for sick and wounded persons during times of conflict.\u201d\nAl-Bursh is one of at least 493 Palestinian medical workers who have been killed in Gaza since October 7, according to the Ministry of Health. The Israel Defense Forces has systematically targeted hospitals from the north to the south of the strip, claiming that Hamas operates in the facilities. Medical staff in Gaza\u2019s hospitals have repeatedly denied this claim. This week, Israeli forces have launched new attacks on Kamal Adwan Hospital and Al-Awda Hospital in the north, with reports on Wednesday and Thursday of medical staff being detained from Al Awda.\nAs ground troops made their way into southern Gaza by the end of the year, attacks on hospitals in the southern city of Khan Younis ramped up. In February, when the Israeli military was laying siege to Nasser Hospital, Al Serr was the only general surgeon there.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very dedicated doctor,\u201d Ahmed Moghrabi, a plastic surgeon who previously worked at Nasser Hospital, said of Al Serr.\nBoth doctors frequently posted to social media about the horrific cases that were flooding into Nasser Hospital, especially as attacks on the facility increased and international media coverage was scarce.\n\u201cI saw children, women in torn pieces,\u201d Moghrabi told The Intercept, explaining why he began posting on social media. \u201cI wanted to show the world what is going on on the ground.\u201d\nThe last time he saw Al Serr was in February. \u201cThey\u201d \u2014 the Israeli military \u2014 \u201csurrounded the hospital and we were trapped,\u201d Moghrabi recalled. \u201cAnd the hospital came under siege for three weeks. We couldn\u2019t really move from one building to another. We couldn\u2019t have a look through the windows. Otherwise the snipers could shoot us.\u201d\nMoghrabi left the hospital in mid-February, during the first invasion. \u201cWe evacuated at midnight that day,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IDF established a checkpoint not far from the hospital gate. They checked everybody actually. My nurse, they took him at the checkpoint. He was detained for two months.\u201d\nAs for Al Serr, Osaid said his cousin left shortly after the February evacuation to go to Rafah and check on his parents, but that he returned to Nasser Hospital to help reopen it and treat patients.\nSince the attack on the hospital in late March, there\u2019s been hardly any news about Al Serr. The only crumbs of information have been more alarming than reassuring. The first is that Al Serr was last seen signed into his WhatsApp in mid-April. \u201cHe was last active online on April 12,\u201d Osaid said, \u201cwhich, to me, tells me that they confiscated his phone and they basically accessed his phone as well.\u201d\nThen, a few days later on April 17, the news outlet Al Mayadeen released an interview with a Palestinian who identified himself as Ahmed Abu Aqel and said he had been detained and released by Israel. Moghrabi told The Intercept that Abu Aqel was previously a nurse at Nasser Hospital.\nClothed in a gray sweatshirt and sweatpants, a common outfit for released Palestinian detainees, Abu Aqel said he had a message from the doctors of Nasser Hospital who were being held in detention.\n\u201cThey are subjected to daily beatings and killing and torture,\u201d Abu Aqel said. \u201cThere is a message in particular from the doctor, Dr. Nahed Abu Ta\u2019imah, director of surgery at the Nasser Medical Complex. His situation is very difficult and he is suffering under very difficult, tragic circumstances. He needs treatment and needs to be seen by the Red Cross and released urgently.\u201d\n\u201cA colleague of mine was being held next to me,\u201d Abu Aqel said. \u201cHis name was Khaled. They plucked his entire beard with pliers in front of me. His beard was plucked. This is one of hundreds I know.\u201d\nOsaid believes he is referring to Khaled Al Serr.\nWhile Abu Aqel did not say where he was held \u2014 where Al Serr may still be \u2014 Osaid thinks it was likely Sde Teiman, a military base and detention center in Israel\u2019s Negev Desert. There have been numerous allegations of abuse, torture, and detainees dying at Sde Teiman. (The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment.)\nAside from Abu Aqel\u2019s vague testimony and the one blip on WhatsApp, there has been no information or updates on Al Serr\u2019s whereabouts or condition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just heartbreaking to know nothing about your loved ones,\u201d Osaid said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he\u2019s alive or not. We don\u2019t know if he\u2019s OK or not.\u201d\nThose Palestinians lucky enough to be released from imprisonment offer harrowing glimpses of what happens inside Israeli detention centers.\nIn December, Khaled Hamouda, another surgeon, was working in Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza. A month earlier, he had been displaced from the Indonesian Hospital, where he normally practiced. At Kamal Adwan, Hamouda was also a patient, receiving treatment for injuries he sustained in an airstrike on his family home in Beit Lahia. His wife, daughter, father, and a brother, among other relatives, were killed in the attack.\nIt was about 10 days after the strike that Israeli forces ordered both medical staff and civilians sheltering at Kamal Adwan Hospital to leave. Hamouda said the hospital administration was told that people would be able to leave and go to a different hospital without being arrested.\nThat was not what happened. Hamouda and some of his colleagues were instead taken into custody by the Israeli military.\n\u201cWhen they attacked the hospital, they asked all the men and youth older than 15 years old and younger than 55 to hold their ID and to get out from the hospital,\u201d Hamouda said. Their eyes were covered, their hands bound, and they were taken to another location, though Hamouda is not sure where.\nSoon after they were taken, images began to spread on social media of dozens of detainees being held by Israeli soldiers in north Gaza. In one photo, a group of men stand shirtless in the foreground as a soldier appears to take their photo. It wasn\u2019t long before people were able to identify one of the men as Hamouda.\n\u201cThis is on the day they took us from Kamal Adwan hospital and they asked us to look at the camera,\u201d Hamouda said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only evidence that I was taken on this day. Nobody knew what happened to us until this photo went to the media.\u201d\nHamouda said he was eventually taken to Sde Teiman, where he and other detainees were forced to remain on their knees. If they didn\u2019t, they were punished. \u201cThey ask him to stand with his hand above his head for about three or four hours,\u201d he said of one prisoner.\n\u201cUnfortunately, when they knew that I am a doctor and general surgeon, they treated me more badly,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey attacked me, and they beat me in my back and my head.\u201d Hamouda said the soldiers wanted to know if he knew about Israelis held captive in Gaza, but he didn\u2019t know anything.\nWhile he was detained, he also saw someone he knew from the medical community: Dr. Adnan Al-Bursh. \u201cThey brought Dr. Adnan in at about 2 or 3 a.m.. He was horribly treated. He was in pain,\u201d Hamouda said. \u201cHe told me, \u2018Khaled, they beat me. They attacked me violently.\u2019\u201d According to Hamouda, Al-Bursh also said he had a fractured rib. Hamouda was able to procure medicine and some food for Al-Bursh but, two days later, the injured doctor was taken away.\nDespite his condition and the harsh circumstances of prison, Al-Bursh brought news for Hamouda. \u201cYour mother is present in Al-Awda Hospital, and she is fine, I treated her,\u201d Hamouda recalled Al-Bursh telling him. Hamouda was grateful for the message: \u201cThis information was very, very precious for me because I didn\u2019t know any information about my family, specifically my mother. So I hugged him and kissed his head and thanked him because it\u2019s the only hope that when I get out, I will find her.\u201d\nAfter three weeks, Hamouda was released. He told The Intercept he and other detainees were driven to the Kerem Shalom border crossing in the south and eventually went to Rafah. His surviving children and his mother were still in the north, and it would be two months before they were able to reunite. He considers himself fortunate because he was released.\n\u201cAll my colleagues, doctors who were arrested with me or after me or before me, they kept them there for about three or four or five months,\u201d he said. \u201cSome are still being held.\u201d\nEven before the war, doctors were crucial in Gaza, especially amid the ebbs and flows of Israeli border restrictions and military attacks.\n\u201cEvery two to three years,\u201d Hamouda said, \u201cwe become trapped in some war or some attack from the Israeli Army. So our work is important for people who present there.\u201d\nHamouda\u2019s father had also been a doctor and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. \u201cHe advised me to be a doctor,\u201d Hamouda said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a benefit to people.\u201d\nFulfilling the necessity of caring for people, Hamouda believes, is why health care workers have become such common targets in this war. \u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence,\u201d he said \u201cThey mean to attack the houses of the people who can treat the wounded people and that can change something in the condition in the north.\u201d\nThe sentiments were shared by Osaid, who said his cousin Al Serr would have agreed: They became doctors to help people. \u201cWith the amount of killing that has been going on for a while, we\u2019re always in need for surgeons to fix traumatic injuries that people sustain,\u201d Osaid said. \u201cAnd so to me, [it] was a natural response growing up in Gaza, the desire of helping out and healing injured people.\u201d\nAl Serr\u2019s posts on Instagram mostly show how he documented the flood of horrific cases that arrived in front of him: a steady stream of civilians torn apart by shrapnel and bullets, punctuated by repeated and escalating attacks on Nasser Hospital. One of his last posts, however, offered a glimmer of hope: two babies born on the day the hospital was invaded in February.\nFor his next post, Al Serr ventured outside the hospital, a reminder of how the war has left no one in Gaza untouched. It was a short video of his neighborhood, homes, and buildings turned to piles of rubble, with the path to his own home buried underneath it all.\n\u201cHe always wanted to form a family,\u201d Osaid said of his cousin, \u201chave kids, build a life and live in peace.\u201d\nWith no word from Al Serr for two months, that chapter of his life feels like an ever more distant possibility.\n\u201cHe was very brave. He was doing his job. Pretty much our job as a surgeon is not just to heal the wounds and to fix wounds, but also to advocate for our patients. So he was advocating for them.\u201d\n\u201cI really hope that he\u2019s OK.\u201d", "hash": "b141180f414e5920dfc1a6019cfccb15338f860bb8f3f5dcb054bbf1d4fef00d", "id":

election interference\nBritain\u2019s parliamentary committee on the national security strategy sent a letter to the prime minister on Thursday warning of threats to the upcoming general election, asking him to use the final two days of Parliament to ensure protections were in place.\nThe committee\u2019s chair, Dame Margaret Beckett, said she had taken to write and publish the letter because \u201cit is not clear if members of the public fully understand how these threats will manifest and what this means for the UK, its democracy and for them as individuals.\u201d\nIt follows Rishi Sunak on Wednesday calling a surprise general election, which had otherwise been expected later this year, to be held on July 4.\nSoon after an election is called in the United Kingdom, the government and the civil service enter a pre-election period of sensitivity \u2014 previously known as \u201cpurdah\u201d \u2014 in which ministers (who remain in office during this time) and their departments aren\u2019t allowed to make official announcements that could have a political effect on the election campaign.\nAmong the casualties of this convention is a planned public consultation on reforming the government\u2019s approach to the ransomware crisis, which cannot now be held until after the election has concluded.\nIn its letter to Sunak, the committee said that its planned sessions in June with two government ministers \u2014 being held as part of an inquiry into Defending Democracy \u2014 were now not going ahead due to the election.\nThe joint committee, composed of members of both the House of Commons and House of Lords, shared its concerns regarding four key ways \u201chostile actors may seek to exploit divisions and weaknesses during the forthcoming election period.\u201d\nIt warned that these hostile actors may seek to \u201cundermine trust in electoral processes through cyberattacks targeted at our institutions, including ransomware attacks,\u201d stressing a concern previously expressed as part of the committee\u2019s inquiry into the government\u2019s response to the ransomware crisis.\nIn their report last year, the committee warned there was a \u201chigh risk\u201d that Britain faced a \u201ccatastrophic ransomware attack at any moment\u201d adding that \u201cif the UK is to avoid being held hostage to fortune and avoid electoral interference, it is vital that ransomware becomes a more pressing political priority.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s letter to the prime minister added that hostile actors could also target \u201chigh-profile individuals such as political candidates to retrieve sensitive information for exploitation through coercion or publication, thereby undermining trust in politicians.\u201d\nA week prior, the country\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) launched a new service to help protect the mobile phones of high-risk individuals \u2014 including candidates in the forthcoming election \u2014 from cyberattacks.\nThe NCSC previously published advice that the personal accounts of political candidates and election officials \u2014 alongside their official work accounts \u2014 are \u201calmost certainly attractive targets for cyber actors looking to carry out espionage operations.\u201d\nThe British government has formally attributed malicious activity targeting British institutions and individuals to hackers working for the Russian intelligence services or affiliated with China.\nIn its letter, the committee also expressed its concern about the spread of disinformation about public figures, including inauthentic audio and videos created using generative AI, which it said could \u201cfuel conspiracy theories and undermine trust in UK leaders and institutions.\u201d\nHostile actors could also \u201csow division and cause chaos where there are already domestic divides on controversial or politicised topics,\u201d the letter added.\nThe committee called on the prime minister \u201cto use the last few days of this Parliament to bring government, political parties, and electoral and security agencies together to identify any last actions that can be taken collectively in the national interest.\u201d\nAlexander Martin\nis the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

Und weil man in der Fotografie erst k\u00fcrzlich den Sprung von analog auf digital vollzogen hatte, blieb man dann doch noch l\u00e4ngere Zeit bei der Canon Digital Ixus, der Nikon Coolpix oder der Fuji FinePix.\nMit den Jahren schlossen die Handy- und Smartphone-Kameras immer mehr zu den Kompaktkameras auf.

Das Kamera-System hat neben der Hauptkamera ein Tele mit einem 3,2-fachen und eines mit einem 5-fachen optischen Zoom. S\u00e4mtliche Zwischenschritte werden digital simuliert, bei denen die Qualit\u00e4t leidet.\nF\u00fcr die bestm\u00f6glichen Aufnahmen reichen die Zoom-Bedienelemente am Touchscreen 1x, 3,2x und 5x sowie 0,5x. Das Auswahlrad hatte ich mit der Belichtungskorrektur belegt, was durchaus sinnvoll ist. Dieses Rad, sowie die Recording-Taste und auch der Zoom-Hebel, lassen sich auf Wunsch mit anderen Funktionen belegen.\nHoch- oder Querformat?\nWas mich mit gemischten Gef\u00fchlen zur\u00fcckl\u00e4sst, ist die Frage des Fotoformats: quer oder hoch? Der unaufhaltsame Vormarsch von Instagram und TikTok hat hochformatige Aufnahmen nicht nur salonf\u00e4hig gemacht: Das Hochformat ist mittlerweile schon fast zum Standard geworden.\nDas l\u00e4sst sich sinnergebend argumentieren: Man betrachtet die Fotos in den allermeisten F\u00e4llen auf dem Smartphone-Screen. Hochkant ist hier die nat\u00fcrliche Ausrichtung. Bei Querformatbildern muss man entweder das Ger\u00e4t drehen oder man verliert den Gro\u00dfteil der Darstellungsfl\u00e4che. Au\u00dferdem lassen sich Hochformatfotos besser und schneller mit einer Hand aufnehmen.\nWie dem auch sei... mit dem Xiaomi 14 Ultra in Kombination mit dem Fotogriff ist man praktisch auf das Querformat angewiesen. Das ist die nat\u00fcrliche Haltung, bei der die Bedienelemente gut erreichbar sind. Hochformat verlangt ein wenig Fingerakrobatik, um die Steuerelemente bedienen zu k\u00f6nnen.\nXiaomi 14 Ultra: Hauptkamera\n7 Bilder\nHohe Bildqualit\u00e4t\nGl\u00e4nzen kann das Xiaomi 14 Ultra auf jeden Fall mit der Bildqualit\u00e4t. Wie kaum ein anderes Smartphone beh\u00e4lt das Xiaomi-Spitzenger\u00e4t die extrem hohe Qualit\u00e4t \u00fcber alle 4 Objektive bei. Die besten Bilder liefert immer noch die Hauptkamera. Minimale Abstriche muss man beim Zoom und Weitwinkel schon hinnehmen.\nDie Bilder mit dem Xiaomi-Spitzenger\u00e4t sind wahrlich spitze, nahezu einwandfrei. Die Fotos haben einen hohen Dynamikumfang, k\u00f6nnen mit Licht-Schatten-Wechsel problemlos umgehen und bestechen durch eine hohe Detail- und Farbtreue.\nDer Portr\u00e4tmodus wirkt nat\u00fcrlich, die Weitwinkelaufnahmen und Zoom-Bilder sind bei Tageslicht ebenso von besonders hoher Qualit\u00e4t. Sogar die Super-Makro-Funktion l\u00e4sst hervorragende Nahaufnahmen entstehen.\nXiaomi 14 Ultra: Zoom und Weitwinkel\n13 Bilder\nSehr gute Nachtaufnahmen\nBei Nacht liefern die Haupt- und Weitwinkelkamera hochwertige Fotos, an denen es kaum etwas zum Aussetzen gibt. Die Details sind weiterhin gut erkennbar, nicht verschwommen und das n\u00e4chtliche Ambiente wird bestens wiedergegeben, ohne dass der HDR-Einsatz \u00fcbertrieben wirkt.\nDer 5-fache optische Zoom hat bei Nacht Problemchen. Wenn man es schafft, das Handy richtig ruhig zu halten, entstehen wundersch\u00f6ne Nachtaufnahmen. Ohne Stativ tut man sich hier damit ziemlich schwer. Dennoch taugt das Tele bei Nacht f\u00fcr den einen oder anderen Schnappschuss in Zoom-\u00c4sthetik.\nW\u00e4hrend die r\u00fcckseitige Kamera das Nonplusultra darstellt, f\u00e4llt die Selfie-Kamera ziemlich entt\u00e4uschend aus. Im Vergleich mit anderen Highend-Smartphones liegt die Qualit\u00e4t der Frontkamera nur im Durchschnitt - auch bei den Portr\u00e4ts.\nXiaomi 14 Ultra: Night-Mode\n9 Bilder\nBrauchbare Videoqualit\u00e4t\nBei der Videoqualit\u00e4t holt Xiaomi st\u00e4ndig auf, kann aber dem iPhone 15 Pro Max nicht das Wasser reichen. Wenn die Kamera nicht bewegt wird, gibt es an der Videoqualit\u00e4t eigentlich nichts auszusetzen. Schwenkt man das Smartphone oder bewegt sich w\u00e4hrend einer Aufnahme damit, dann kommt das Bildrauschen negativ zu tragen.\nDer Stabilisator funktioniert gut und verschafft dem Clip einen ruhigen und smoothen Eindruck. Allerdings geht die Stabilisierung zulasten der Videoqualit\u00e4t, die relativ stark darunter leidet.\nDie KI-Tools\nKommen wir zum Foto-Editor: Die g\u00e4ngigen Tools sind ohnehin vorhanden. Bei den Kreativwerkzeugen, die zum Teil angeblich auf eine KI zur\u00fcckgreifen, hat Xiaomi ebenso aufgeholt. Beim Wegradieren von st\u00f6renden Objekten kann Xiaomi aber nicht mit der Galaxy AI von Samsung oder den Google Pixel Phones mithalten.\nWie gut die KI-Tools funktionieren, h\u00e4ngt ma\u00dfgeblich von der Szenerie ab. Insofern lohnt sich ein Blick in den Foto-Editor auf alle F\u00e4lle. Bei manchen Aufnahmen k\u00f6nnen die verschiedenen Werkzeuge tats\u00e4chlich hilfreich sein.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Samsung Galaxy S24 im Test: So schl\u00e4gt sich das KI-Handy\nDer Akku\nDer Akku des Xiaomi 14 Ultra hat eine Kapazit\u00e4t von 5.000 mAh und kann kabelgebunden besonders rasch mit bis zu 90 Watt aufgeladen werden. Kabellos sind es 80 Watt. Der Kameragriff erh\u00f6ht die Akkukapazit\u00e4t um weitere 1.500 mAh.\nBesonders lange h\u00e4lt der Akku dennoch nicht durch. Hier kann h\u00f6chstens von einer durchschnittlichen Akkulaufzeit gesprochen werden. Ich w\u00fcrde sogar behaupten, dass viele andere Spitzenklasse-Smartphones l\u00e4nger mit einer Akkuladung durchkommen als das Xiaomi 14 Ultra.\nFazit\nWenn f\u00fcr ein Smartphone die Bezeichnung Highend-Ger\u00e4t zutrifft, dann f\u00fcr das Xiaomi 14 Ultra. Die meisten Spezifikationen sind auf die Spitze getrieben und wissen nicht zu entt\u00e4uschen - bis auf den Akku und die Frontkamera.\nDer Leica-Schriftzug an der Kamera steht f\u00fcr eine besonders hohe Bildqualit\u00e4t. Das Branding h\u00e4lt, was es verspricht: Die Fotos sind nahezu makellos und extrem hochwertig - egal ob Weitwinkel, optischer Zoom, Hauptkamera, Portr\u00e4tmodus oder Nachtaufnahme.\nDas Photography Kit bringt die Haptik der Kompaktkameras zur\u00fcck. Wirklich alltagstauglich fand ich das Zubeh\u00f6r allerdings nicht. Ich habe mich bereits an den Smartphone-Formfaktor gew\u00f6hnt, sodass ich einen solchen Kameragriff mit seinen Bedienelementen absolut nicht vermisse.\nInsofern sehe ich das Photography Kit als Gimmick, das kein Schn\u00e4ppchen ist. 199 Euro will Xiaomi f\u00fcr das Kamerazubeh\u00f6r. Daf\u00fcr erh\u00e4lt man einen kleinen Hauch von Leica-Feeling.\nDas Xiaomi 14 Ultra selbst ist ebenfalls nicht g\u00fcnstig. Der Preis im offiziellen Xiaomi-Webshop liegt bei 1.499 Euro. \u00dcber Preisvergleichsplattformen wird das Xiaomi-Flaggschiff f\u00fcr 1.189 Euro angeboten - hier auf Amazon.\nXiaomi 14 als Alternative\nWer eine \u00e4hnlich gute Kamera haben m\u00f6chte und auf das Photography Kit verzichten kann, sollte sich das Xiaomi 14 ansehen. Es hat weitgehend dieselbe Ausstattung wie das Ultra-Modell. Zu den gr\u00f6\u00dften Abstrichen geh\u00f6rt der Verzicht auf den 5-fachen optischen Zoom und den 1''-Type Bildsensor.\nDaf\u00fcr ist das Xiaomi 14 g\u00fcnstiger: Auf Preisvergleichsplattformen ist die 512-GB-Version bereits f\u00fcr 785 Euro gelistet. Auf Amazon wird das Xiaomi 14 zu einem \u00e4hnlichen Preis angeboten.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Xiaomi 14 mit Leica-Kamera im Test\nWarum wir Partnerlinks einsetzen\nUnsere Artikel entstehen in redaktioneller Unabh\u00e4ngigkeit.

While traditional and generic awareness programs focus on awareness and knowledge transfer\u2013educating individuals about potential threats and instructing them on response strategies\u2013this approach often falls short in today\u2019s dynamic environment. The evolving landscape requires an evolution to holistic human risk management, which prioritizes the outcomes and the drivers of behavior and helps to sustainably mitigate human risks,\u201d said Dr Niklas Hellemann, Psychologist and CEO at SoSafe.\nThe Human Risk OS brings together all of SoSafe\u2019s security offerings into a single cohesive platform that helps security teams to drive a holistic human risk management strategy and foster security cultures. It focuses on proactively managing security risks through real-time risk detection and continuous analyses, provides enhanced behavioural insights and recommends targeted interventions to customize and optimize defensive responses.\nIts three core elements are:\nHuman Behavior Sensors measure an organization\u2019s digital activities, behaviors, and security culture, creating individual and group-level profiles of security behavior.\nThe Human Security Index processes this tracked data and additional contextual information such as level of seniority, tenure, digital access, and functional criticality to create a single index that summarizes security performance for groups and organizations. This score allows organizations to quickly identify concern areas, track progress, and evolution over time, and the impact of different possible interventions.\nThe Intervention Hub suggests intervention strategies to mitigate human-related security risks and drive behavioral change and healthy security.\n\u201cWe believe in the power of people in the fight against cybercrime. With The Human Risk OS\u2122, organizations invest in more than just a security solution\u2014they invest in a proactive approach to mitigating human-centric risk and securing their organization\u2019s future by putting people at the very center of their efforts. We empower organizations to drive behavioral change and build security cultures by identifying, quantifying, actively managing, and reducing their human risk and by focusing on efficiency to relieve the pressure on overstretched security teams,\u201d said Gon\u00e7alo Gaiolas, CPO at SoSafe.\nSoSafe also introduced additional capabilities to its \u201cSofie Human Security Copilot\u201d, an AI-powered multi-channel agent built to meaningfully reduce human risk. Sofie supports security professionals and users with rapid threat awareness, situational awareness, and zero-level security and compliance support. Security leaders can now incorporate organisational policies and specifics into their responses.\nBuilt on advanced large language models and featuring an engaging interface, Sofie provides answers to support questions at any time, sends urgent security alerts, and educates users on security best practices, all customized to specific organizational needs and policies.\nUnlike other conversational AI-solutions, Sofie focuses on making each interaction with the end user a learning moment in their daily work environment, not just delivering informative content, but also aiming to change behavior.\n\u201cCybercriminals are already harnessing the power of AI to enhance their social engineering attacks. It\u2019s time to use the full potential of AI on the defensive side as well. Our AI-powered multi-channel agent \u2018Sofie\u2019 demonstrates the power of AI for cyber defenses: It\u2019s a multifunctional tool that makes security information accessible to everyone anytime, provides learning opportunities in every interaction, and supports security administrators with content and communication, automating responses to free up their team\u2019s capacity. \u2018Sofie\u2019 makes cybersecurity part of our everyday work, manifesting security cultures as the most essential part of holistic human risk management,\u201d added Gaiolas.\n\u201cSoSafe\u2019s Human Risk OS\u2122 and Sofie help security leaders to efficiently drive a human risk management strategy that sustainably mitigates risk. Based on behavioral data and fueled with new technology, SoSafe simplifies where others complicate, making it easy for security professionals to strengthen the human layer as the most versatile part of our defense strategy.

Schiffe haben den erheblichen Nachteil, dass sie viele Treibhausgase aussto\u00dfen: Die Schifffahrt ist f\u00fcr rund 3 Prozent der globalen CO2-Emissionen verantwortlich.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Frachtschiff mit Segeln: So viel Treibstoff wurde wirklich gespart\nDie Schiffe m\u00fcssten nur anders fahren\nPl\u00e4ne, um die Abgase zu reduzieren, drehen sich meist um andere Antriebsarten. Die Organisation Blue Visby hat jedoch eine bessere Idee, wie Newatlas berichtet, frei nach der Floskel: \"Owe vom Gas\".\nBisher fahren die meisten Frachtschiffe nach dem Muster SFTW: sail fast, then wait. Sie sind m\u00f6glichst schnell unterwegs, um zum Ziel zu kommen. Dann stehen sie aber vor oder im Hafen und verbrennen weiter Treibstoff, bis sie mit der Ent- und Wiederbeladung am entsprechendem Dock an der Reihe sind.\nDie Idee von Blue Visby ist, dass sie stattdessen einfach vorher langsamer fahren. Anstatt unn\u00f6tig zu warten, kommen sie dann p\u00fcnktlich zum Termin im Hafen an.\nVielversprechende Studien\nBlue Visby rechnete etwa aus, dass 3.651 Panamax-Schiffe im Jahr 2022 20.580 Touren absolvieren. Durch die vorgeschlagene Anpassung der Fahrtgeschwindigkeit lie\u00dfe sich deren Emissionsaussto\u00df im Schnitt um 23,2 Prozent senken, ohne dass die fristgerechte Zustellung der Container darunter leiden m\u00fcsste.\nAuch weitere Studienergebnisse legen nahe, dass der Tempo-Ansatz sehr vielversprechend ist. Eine Berechnung zeigt, dass wenn Lastschiffe durchschnittlich um einen Knoten (1,85 km/h) langsamer fahren, ihre Emissionen im Schnitt um 16 Prozent sinken.\nKonkret ausprobiert hat Blue Visby das jetzt bei 2 Testfahrten mit Transportschiffen.

Hier d\u00fcrfte vermutlich die Schwierigkeit liegen. Denn das schnelle Ansteuern des Hafens und anschlie\u00dfende Warten mit laufendem Motor gilt in der Schifffahrt als fest verankerter Standard. Es ist sogar in vielen Vertr\u00e4gen festgelegt, dass die Schiffe im Hafen warten m\u00fcssen.\nNeben den Schiffen m\u00fcssten weltweit H\u00e4fen, Kan\u00e4le und Schleusen die Software nutzen, damit alles Hand-in-Hand gehen und die bestm\u00f6gliche CO2-Ersparnis erzielt werden kann. Die Organisation Blue Visby hat sich deshalb ein mehrteiliges System aus Vertr\u00e4gen, einer Spezialsoftware und einem Vorteilsausgleich ausgedacht: So sollen etwa durch eine Aufteilung der Gewinne durch die einsgeparten Treibstoffkosten alle Stakeholder motiviert werden, an einem Strang zu ziehen.\nDie Software soll den Schiffen beim Anpassen der Geschwindigkeit helfen, damit sie p\u00fcnktlich entladen werden k\u00f6nnen, obwohl sie zun\u00e4chst langsamer fahren. Blue Visby betont, dass sich die Softwarel\u00f6sung mit existierenden Technologien umgesetzt und in das vorhandene regulatorisches Rahmenwerk integriert werden kann. Dies soll die Kosten der Umsetzung f\u00fcr die Reedereien gering halten.\nKommentare", "hash": "4d71fdcd29c533c07f6e57e0dd3a946419ff4743a48e911cf17540c6d4c8325d", "id": "cbd73bb9-63fe-4e43-b58f-b3ce473afabd", "link": "https://futurezone.at/science/reduziert-schiffsemissionen-17-prozent-container-schiffe-cargo-blue-visby-geschwindigkeit/402904221", "osint_source_id": "eec2ad26-2f4c-4dd8-a3e5-08c0eb3765ca", "published": "2024-05-24T11:30:01", "source": "https://futurezone.at/xml/rss", "story_id": "640666b1-f443-4c17-af5a-39dd7c4a2785", "title": "Extrem simple Idee reduziert Schiffsemissionen um 17 Prozent"}], "tags": {"Blue Visby": {"name": "Blue Visby", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Newatlas": {"name": "Newatlas", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Extrem simple Idee reduziert Schiffsemissionen um 17 Prozent"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T17:15:46.670742", "id": "0b3df236-6a07-4039-a0ab-4098119c1d3f", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-24T17:12:37.792680", "id": "2c990f98-c540-4856-8dfe-38adeb4cf324", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-24T11:07:53", "id": "f2e5fe26-cdac-4476-8a90-cbb86dab6063", "news_items": [{"author": "Bruce Schneier", "content": "On the Zero-Day Market\nNew paper: \u201cZero Progress on Zero Days: How the Last Ten Years Created the Modern Spyware Market\u201c:\nAbstract: Spyware makes surveillance simple.

The last ten years have also been marked by stark failures to control spyware and its precursors and components. This Article accounts for and critiques these failures, providing a socio-technical history since 2014, particularly focusing on the conversation about trade in zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits. Second, this Article applies lessons from these failures to guide regulatory efforts going forward. While recognizing that controlling this trade is difficult, I argue countries should focus on building and strengthening multilateral coalitions of the willing, rather than on strong-arming existing multilateral institutions into working on the problem. Individually, countries should focus on export controls and other sanctions that target specific bad actors, rather than focusing on restricting particular technologies.

But the potential damage that can be caused by AI inaccuracy gets multiplied when those errors appear atop the ultra-valuable web real estate of the Google search results page.\n\"The examples we've seen are generally very uncommon queries and aren\u2019t representative of most people\u2019s experiences,\" a Google spokesperson told Ars. \"The vast majority of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to dig deeper on the web.\"\nAfter looking through dozens of examples of Google AI Overview mistakes (and replicating many ourselves for the galleries below), we've noticed a few broad categories of errors that seemed to show up again and again. Consider this a crash course in some of the current weak points of Google's AI Overviews and a look at areas of concern for the company to improve as the system continues to roll out.\nTreating jokes as facts\nSome of the funniest example of Google's AI Overview failing come, ironically enough, when the system doesn't realize a source online was trying to be funny. An AI answer that suggested using \"1/8 cup of non-toxic glue\" to stop cheese from sliding off pizza can be traced back to someone who was obviously trying to troll an ongoing thread. A response recommending \"blinker fluid\" for a turn signal that doesn't make noise can similarly be traced back to a troll on the Good Sam advice forums, which Google's AI Overview apparently trusts as a reliable source.\nIn regular Google searches, these jokey posts from random Internet users probably wouldn't be among the first answers someone saw when clicking through a list of web links. But with AI Overviews, those trolls were integrated into the authoritative-sounding data summary presented right at the top of the results page.\nWhat's more, there's nothing in the tiny \"source link\" boxes below Google's AI summary to suggest either of these forum trolls are anything other than good sources of information. Sometimes, though, glancing at the source can save you some grief, such as when you see a response calling running with scissors \"cardio exercise that some say is effective\" (that came from a 2022 post from Little Old Lady Comedy).\nBad sourcing\nSometimes Google's AI Overview offers an accurate summary of a non-joke source that happens to be wrong. When asking about how many Declaration of Independence signers owned slaves, for instance, Google's AI Overview accurately summarizes a Washington University of St. Louis library page saying that one-third \"were personally enslavers.\" But the response ignores contradictory sources like a Chicago Sun-Times article saying the real answer is closer to three-quarters. I'm not enough of a history expert to judge which authoritative-seeming source is right, but at least one historian online took issue with the Google AI's answer sourcing.\nOther times, a source that Google trusts as authoritative is really just fan fiction. That's the case for a response that imagined a 2022 remake of 2001: A Space Odyssey, directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by George Lucas. A savvy web user would probably do a double-take before citing citing Fandom's \"Idea Wiki\" as a reliable source, but a careless AI Overview user might not notice where the AI got its information.\nPromoted Comments", "hash": "8e3999494b5afce9488ace6e42bdd4f0a5a0e3d29deb2843bae6ff43502abcb6", "id": "821bf8ac-d06a-40b7-b537-23e6149ba7e5", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025825", "osint_source_id": "a71fce67-918e-4ec0-bd23-e575b5149c1b", "published": "2024-05-24T11:00:27", "source": "http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/technology-lab", "story_id": "d40f0fb7-cf87-40af-a5ee-d1568802390e", "title": "Google\u2019s \u201cAI Overview\u201d can give false, misleading, and dangerous answers"}], "tags": {"Ars": {"name": "Ars", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Chicago": {"name": "Chicago", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Google": {"name": "Google", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Internet": {"name": "Internet", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Steven Spielberg": {"name": "Steven Spielberg", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Google\u2019s \u201cAI Overview\u201d can give false, misleading, and dangerous answers"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T09:12:42.216382", "id": "cbf01d48-59f8-4b56-aa07-800527a7ddd5", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "2"}], "created": "2024-05-24T11:00:00", "id": "5ac9a734-0b2b-4a41-b67d-4703099becfe", "news_items": [{"author": "Johannes Schuster", "content": "iPad Pro 13\" M4 im Test: Was Apples 3000-Euro-Tablet taugt\nDas iPad Pro ist flacher und schneller als jedes Apple-Tablet zuvor.

Or any other physical calculator, for that matter. Which is all the more reason to appreciate this Wang 300-series calculator console\u2019s revival through a new electronic backend.\nIf you haven\u2019t made the acquaintance of the Wang calculator series, [Bob Alexander]\u2019s previous Wang project is a perfect introduction. Despite looking very much like an overbuilt early-70s desktop calculator, what you see in the video below is just a terminal, one of four that could connect to a shared \u201cElectronics Package\u201d where most of the actual computational work was done. The package was big and is currently hard to come by, at least at a reasonable price, but the consoles, with their Nixie displays and sturdy keypads, are relatively abundant.\n[Bob]\u2019s previous venture into reviving his console involved embedding a PIC32-based controller, turning it into the standalone desktop calculator it never was. To keep more with the original design philosophy, [Bob]\u2019s second stab at the problem moves much of the same circuitry from inside the console into a dedicated outboard package, albeit one much smaller than the original. The replacement package extends and enhances the console functionality a bit, adding a real-time clock and a Nixie exercise routine to ward off the dreaded cathode poisoning. [Bob] also recreates the original Wang logarithmic method of multiplication and division, which is a nice touch with its distinctive flashing display.\nSeeing the Wang console hooked up to a package through that thick cable and Centronics connector is oddly satisfying. We\u2019d love to see [Bob] take this to the logical extent and support multiple consoles, but that might be pushing things a bit.\n7 thoughts on \u201cConsole Calculator Moves One Step Closer To Original Design\u201d\nThanks for the write-up!\nI am amazed that a tool such as a desktop calculator was once a server-and-terminal package. A little over 25 years later, I had the same computing power available in a package as big as one of those nixie tubes; namely my wrist watch (we\u2019re talking 1991 here).\n\u201cWith smartphone apps and spreadsheets being the main ways people crunch their numbers nowadays, there\u2019s not much call for a desktop calculator.\u201d\nStill keep a solar calculator for the same reason people still read on an E-ink reader.\nI have not one but two casio fx-82\u2019s (as one is always gone) on my desk: I simple prefer the eye-free blind typing of the rubber keys to having to look at my phone screen (and looking away from where I was looking).\nA pocket calculator isn\u2019t exactly a computer, though. It\u2019s more like a stack machine.\nProgrammable computers and graphical \u201ccalculators\u201d are a different story.\nAlso size and computing speed aren\u2019t everything, so this are apple and orange comparisons.\nThings like reliability and accuracy or precision are factors, too.\nSuper video, and really nice work on putting an old relic to good use. Everyone likes Nixie displays and clacking keys. The date and time display enhances it\u2019s usefulness too.\nAbsolutely. They\u2019re still wonderful \u201cterminal\u201d devices and as useful as ever.\nHaving older technology around also is good because of diversity.\nKnowing and working with different technologies allows people to extend their horizon and find new solution.\nEspecially tube technology is a very human-specific technology, I think, because it doesn\u2019t exist in nature.\nUsing glowing filaments in a vacuum is more ingenious than making crystals \u201cthink\u201d (crystal detector, diode, transistor).\nPlease be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

A threat actor used the security feature in Windows to encrypt 100TB of data on 40 servers at a hospital in Belgium. Another attacker used it to encrypt systems of a Moscow-based meat producer and distributor.\nIn September 2022, Microsoft warned that an Iranian state-sponsored attacker utilized BitLocker to encrypt systems running Windows 10, Windows 11, or Windows Server 2016 and newer.\nHowever, Kaspersky says that ShrinkLocker comes \"with previously unreported features to maximize the damage of the attack.\"\nShrinkLocker is written in Visual Basic Scripting (VBScript), a language Microsoft introduced in 1996 and is now on a deprecation path - available as a feature-on-demand starting Windows 11, version 24H2 (currently in the release preview stage).\nOne of its capabilities is detecting the specific Windows version running on the target machine by using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) with the Win32_OperatingSystem class.\nThe attack continues only if specific parameters are met, such as the current domain matching the target and an operating system (OS) version that is newer than Vista. Otherwise, ShrinkLocker finishes automatically and deletes itself.\nIf the target matches the requirements for the attack, the malware uses the diskpart utility in Windows to shrink every non-boot partition by 100MB and splits the unallocated space into new primary volumes of the same size.\nKaspersky researchers say that in Windows 2008 and 2012, ShrinkLocker ransomware first saved the boot files along with the index of the other volumes.\nThe same resize operations are performed on other Windows OS versions but with a different piece of code, the researchers explain in their technical analysis.\nThe malware then uses the BCDEdit command-line tool to reinstall the boot files on the newly created partitions.\nLocking users out\nShrinkLocker also modifies registry entries to disable remote desktop connections or enable BitLocker encryption on hosts without a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) - a dedicated chip that provides hardware-based, security-related functions.\nThrough dynamic malware analysis, Kaspersky researchers were able to confirm the malware making the following registry changes:\nfDenyTSConnections = 1: disables RDP connections\n-\nscforceoption = 1: enforces smart card authentication\n-\nUseAdvancedStartup = 1: requires the use of the BitLocker PIN for pre-boot authentication\n-\nEnableBDEWithNoTPM = 1: allows BitLocker without a compatible TPM chip\n-\nUseTPM = 2: allows the use of TPM if available\n-\nUseTPMPIN = 2: allows the use of a startup PIN with TPM if available\n-\nUseTPMKey = 2: allows the use of a startup key with TPM if available\n-\nUseTPMKeyPIN = 2: allows the use of a startup key and PIN with TPM if available\n-\nEnableNonTPM = 1: allows BitLocker without a compatible TPM chip, requires a password or startup key on a USB flash drive\n-\nUsePartialEncryptionKey = 2: requires the use of a startup key with TPM\n-\nUsePIN = 2: requires the use of a startup PIN with TPM\n-\nThe threat actor behind ShrinkLocker does not drop a ransom file to establish a communication channel with the victim. Instead, they provide a contact email address (onboardingbinder[at]proton[dot]me, conspiracyid9[at]protonmail[dot]com) as the label of the new boot partitions.\nHowever, this label won't be seen by admins unless they boot the device using a recovery environment or through other diagnostic tools, making it fairly easy to miss.\nAfter encrypting the drives, the threat actor deletes the BitLocker protectors (e.g. TPM, PIN, startup key, password, recovery password, recovery key) to deny the victim any option to recover BitLocker's encryption key, which is sent to the attacker.\nThe key generated for encrypting files is a 64-character combination of random multiplication and replacement of a variable with 0-9 numbers, special characters, and the holoalphabetic sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"\nThe key is delivered through the TryCloudflare tool, a legitimate service for developers to experiment with CloudFlare's Tunnel without adding a site to CloudFlare's DNS.\nIn the final stage of the attack, ShrinkLocker forces the system to shut down for all the changes to take effect and leave the user with the drives locked and no BitLocker recovery options.\nBitLocker allows you to create a custom message on recovery screens, which would have been a perfect spot to display an extortion message to victims.\nThe lack of an easily seen ransom note and an email simply left as a drive label could indicate that these attacks are meant to be destructive in nature rather than for financial gain.\nKaspersky discovered that ShrinkLocker has multiple variants and it has been used against a government entity as well as organizations in the steel and vaccine manufacturing industries in Mexico, Indonesia, and Jordan.\nCristian Souza, an incident response specialist at Kaspersky Global Emergency Response Team, says that companies using BitLocker on their systems should ensure secure storage of recovery keys and maintain regular backups that are saved offline and tested.\nAdditionally, organizations are recommended to use a properly configured EPP (Endpoint Protection Platforms) solution to detect BitLocker abuse attempts, enable minimal privileges for users, enable logging and monitoring for network traffic (both GET and POST requests), track events related to VBS and PowerShell execution and log associated scripts.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

Jetzt gibt es erste Erkl\u00e4rungsans\u00e4tze.\nEin beunruhigender iOS-Bug sorgt weiter f\u00fcr Verunsicherung, zumal Apple bislang kaum handfeste Details dazu geliefert hat. Nach einer Analyse von Sicherheitsforschern kann eine Migrationsroutine in iOS 17.5 dazu f\u00fchren, dass eigentlich gel\u00f6scht geglaubte, aber weiterhin im Dateisystem verzeichnete Fotos wieder frisch in Apples Fotos-App hinzugef\u00fcgt werden. Dies passiert demnach rein mit lokal auf dem Ger\u00e4t liegenden Dateien und unabh\u00e4ngig von iCloud-Fotos. Die zur\u00fcckgebrachten Bilder stammen folglich wohl nicht von Apples Servern.\nNicht richtig gel\u00f6schte iPhone-Fotos bleiben offenbar ungel\u00f6scht\nApples Bugfix-Update iOS 17.5.1 habe diese in iOS 17.5 erg\u00e4nzte Routine wieder entfernt, erl\u00e4utert Synacktiv basierend auf einem Vergleich von Code-\u00c4nderungen in den beiden Betriebssystemversionen. iOS scheint allerdings auch keine Anstalten zu machen, die vermeintlich gel\u00f6schten, jedoch tats\u00e4chlich noch im Dateisystem vorhandenen Fotos anschlie\u00dfend richtig zu l\u00f6schen. iOS 17.5.1 verhindert demnach nur, dass die nicht mehr sichtbaren Bilder wieder in der Fotos-App erscheinen.\nAuch von Apple ist zu vernehmen, dass iCloud-Fotos an dem Bug unbeteiligt sei: Die nicht richtig vom Ger\u00e4t gel\u00f6schten Fotos seien gar nicht erst mit iCloud-Fotos synchronisiert worden, betonte ein nicht n\u00e4her genannter \u2013 und auch nicht w\u00f6rtlich zitierter \u2013 Apple-Mitarbeiter gegen\u00fcber 9to5Mac. Diese lokal noch im Dateisystem vorhandenen, ungel\u00f6schten Fotos konnten demnach aber \u00fcber Jahre von iPhone zu iPhone mitgenommen werden, etwa durch lokale Backups oder die direkte Datenmigration vom alten auf ein neues iPhone. Auch iCloud-Backups k\u00f6nnen offenbar die nicht richtig gel\u00f6schten Aufnahmen enthalten. In iCloud-Backups werden Fotos aber generell nur dann gesichert, wenn der Nutzer die davon getrennte iCloud-Fotos-Funktion nicht aktiviert hat.\nWie zuverl\u00e4ssig l\u00f6scht iOS Dateien?\nEinen (inzwischen wieder entfernten) Nutzerbericht bei Reddit, demzufolge fremde Fotos auf einem zuvor zur\u00fcckgesetzten und ordnungsgem\u00e4\u00df gel\u00f6schten iPad auftauchten, wies Apple gegen\u00fcber 9to5Mac als falsch zur\u00fcck.\nWie Apple bei der Ver\u00f6ffentlichung von iOS 17.5.1 nur kurz mitteilte, kann das Fotos betreffen, die \"eine Datenbankbesch\u00e4digung gehabt haben\".

Das hei\u00dft, die Inhalte flie\u00dfen sowohl in das Training von Metas KI-Modellen, als auch in die KI-Tools. Es gibt eine M\u00f6glichkeit, Einspruch zu erheben.\nZun\u00e4chst einmal bedeutet der Hinweis, dass Meta AI bald in Deutschland verf\u00fcgbar sein sollte \u2013 das ist im Grunde ein KI-Assistent, der als Chatbot und Bildgenerator in die Dienste einzieht. Die \u00c4nderung der Richtlinien gilt ab dem 26. Juni 2024. Das hei\u00dft nicht, dass man automatisch auch sofort alle KI-Funktionen nutzen kann, lange wird es dann aber wahrscheinlich nicht mehr dauern. Hinter Meta AI verbirgt sich das hauseigene Gro\u00dfe Sprachmodell Llama 3.\nBerechtigtes Interesse oder Recht auf Widerspruch\nZu den Inhalten, die Facebook nutzen m\u00f6chte, geh\u00f6ren s\u00e4mtliche Beitr\u00e4ge, Bilder inklusive der Bildunterschriften und die Gespr\u00e4che, die man mit dem KI-Chatbot f\u00fchrt. Explizit ausgenommen sind private Nachrichten. Dabei berufen sie sich auf ihr \"berechtigtes Interesse\". Das ist eine Art Ausnahme, die in der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung (DSGVO) vorgesehen ist, um die Datenverarbeitung zu erlauben, ohne dass die Betroffenen anderweitig einwilligen m\u00fcssen. Allerdings muss dieses \"berechtigte Interesse\" laut DSGVO gut begr\u00fcndet sein. Ob Metas Begr\u00fcndung ausreichend ist, m\u00fcssen in der Folge die Datensch\u00fctzer bewerten. Sie scheinen sich darauf zu berufen, dass KI allen Nutzerinnen und Nutzern zugutek\u00e4me.\nNutzerinnen und Nutzer bekommen jedoch auch die M\u00f6glichkeit, Einspruch einzulegen. Obwohl der gesamte Hinweis auf Deutsch ist, steht in genau diesem Satz auf Englisch, man habe das \"right to object\", was nichts anderes hei\u00dft als ein Einspruchsrecht. Nicht jeder wird das auf Anhieb verstehen. Wenn man Widerspruch einlegt, ist allerdings nicht gesagt, dass diesem auch automatisch stattgegeben wird. Man muss seine Gr\u00fcnde darlegen, noch ist uns keine Reaktion von Meta dazu bekannt.\nVorteile durch K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz\nMeta selbst sieht darin freilich nur Vorteile, wenn die KI in die Dienste einzieht. Man kann dann freilich mit einem KI-Chatbot sprechen, diesen Beitr\u00e4ge verfassen lassen, wenn einem selbst nichts einf\u00e4llt, oder ihn nach anderen Inhalten suchen lassen. Die KI-Tools k\u00f6nnen aber auch lustige Sticker erstellen oder f\u00fcr einen selbst besonders relevante Inhalte finden \u2013 gemeint ist, auf Basis der eigenen Interessen, die ausgewertet und verarbeitet werden. Alle Daten helfen, \"KI bei Meta weiterzuentwickeln und zu verbessern\", steht in dem Pop-up.\nSelbst wenn man von seinem Einspruchsrecht Gebrauch macht und diesem stattgegeben wird, die eigenen Beitr\u00e4ge also nicht in die KI-Dienste flie\u00dfen, hei\u00dft das nicht, dass man auch endg\u00fcltig fein raus ist. Beitr\u00e4ge von anderen Personen, die einen zeigen oder in denen man verlinkt oder genannt wird, k\u00f6nnen freilich noch immer in die KI-Modelle flie\u00dfen.\nGoogle geht in seinen Nutzungsbedingungen sogar fast noch einen Schritt weiter. Alle Inhalte, die im Internet \u00f6ffentlich verf\u00fcgbar sind, werden f\u00fcr das Training der KI-Modelle genutzt. Webseitenbetreiber, die Google aussperren m\u00f6chten, tauchen zugleich auch nicht mehr in den Suchergebnissen auf. Das ist in der Regel ein herber Verlust f\u00fcr Urheber.\n(emw)", "hash": "fe4e837550a3d0663d172b1a6ea3d76b11f4a36675f6d05684085ff7f9b286c5", "id": "0aaf7686-f13e-459e-9b54-01c7e9f494ae", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Meta-AI-Alle-geposteten-Beitraege-bei-Facebook-wandern-in-die-KI-9730590.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-24T10:34:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "4fa13281-50d5-4923-8af6-520dfa25191c", "title": "Meta AI: Alle geposteten Beitr\u00e4ge bei Facebook wandern in die KI"}], "tags": {"Deutschland": {"name": "Deutschland", "tag_type": "Country"}, "Metas": {"name": "Metas", "tag_type": "PER"}, "UPS": {"name": "UPS", "tag_type": "APT"}, "emw": {"name": "emw", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Meta AI: Alle geposteten Beitr\u00e4ge bei Facebook wandern in die KI"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T09:10:23.894757", "id": "12cb9ad5-216a-4c33-a0ff-cb8cb00eb9ec", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "2"}, {"created": "2024-05-24T09:17:50.964386", "id": "aabc4554-df2e-4388-a055-ac3d93ae12d0", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "20"}], "created": "2024-05-24T10:26:00", "id": "0122a331-6da7-499a-9fb9-572923847a84", "news_items": [{"author": "Falk Steiner", "content": "Ministertreffen: Deutscher Umgang mit Huawei bleibt unklar\nDie Debatte um chinesische Netzausr\u00fcster geht weiter. Nach einem Spitzentreffen der Bundesregierung gibt es Ank\u00fcndigungen \u00fcber eine baldige Entscheidung.\nWie die Bundesregierung chinesische Netzwerktechnik aus den Mobilfunknetzen herausbekommen will, bleibt weiterhin unklar. Eine Entscheidung soll jedoch noch vor der parlamentarischen Sommerpause ab Anfang Juli fallen. Das wurde Medienberichten zufolge bei einem Spitzentreffen am Donnerstag entschieden, beteiligt daran waren Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz (SPD), Bundesinnenministerin Nancy Faeser (SPD), Bundesdigitalminister Volker Wissing (FDP), Au\u00dfenministerin Annalena Baerbock (Gr\u00fcne) und Bundeswirtschaftsminister Robert Habeck (Gr\u00fcne).\nBereits seit mehreren Jahren wird in der Bundesregierung dar\u00fcber debattiert, ob das Risiko, das vor allem von Huawei f\u00fcr die deutschen Mobilfunknetze ausgeht, zu gro\u00df sei. \u00d6ffentlich vorgetragene Belege daf\u00fcr, dass Hard- und Software der Firma ein IT-Sicherheitsrisiko darstelle, gibt es nicht. Die Bundesregierung wies bereits im Januar darauf hin, dass mit \"zunehmender informationstechnischer Komplexit\u00e4t von kritischen (Software-)Komponenten [\u2026] ein wesentlicher Teil der Beherrschbarkeit der Technologie im Rahmen der Produktpflege (Softwareupdates, Firmware-Updates, Schlie\u00dfen von Sicherheitsl\u00fccken) beim Hersteller selbst oder innerhalb der weiteren Lieferkette\" verbleibe. Ob dieses Risiko in Zukunft beherrschbar ist, ist umstritten.\nDazu kommen weitere Bedenken, in der internationalen Debatte werden sowohl Vorkommnisse in Australien als auch eine grunds\u00e4tzliche, wirtschaftspolitische Frage angef\u00fchrt: W\u00fcrden die beiden europ\u00e4ischen Netzwerkausr\u00fcster Nokia und Ericsson \u00fcberhaupt dauerhaft \u00fcberleben, wenn Huawei weiter weltweit Marktanteile erringt?\n2021 war mit der Novelle dem IT-Sicherheitsgesetz 2.0 der neue Paragraf 9b ins BSI-Gesetz aufgenommen worden. Mit ihm kann das Bundesinnenministerium den erstmaligen Einsatz neuer, kritischer Komponenten in Kritischer Infrastruktur (KRITIS) untersagen, wenn etwa die sicherheitspolitische Unbedenklichkeit infrage steht. Bis Anfang Mai 2024 wurden insgesamt 19 Komponenten von den Betreibern angezeigt, von einer formellen Untersagung durch das Innenministerium ist nichts bekannt. Das BMI hatte im vergangenen Jahr zus\u00e4tzlich zur Pr\u00fcfung neuer Komponenten auch eine Pr\u00fcfung bereits im Einsatz befindlicher Bauteile begonnen. Die Ergebnisse dieser Ex-Ante-Pr\u00fcfung, bei der alle in den jeweiligen \u00f6ffentlichen 5G-Mobilfunknetzen bereits im Einsatz befindlichen kritischen Komponenten analysiert werden, liegen bis heute nicht vor.\nHabeck: \"Einfach mal tun\"\nNoch vor wenigen Tagen hatte Bundeswirtschaftsminister Robert Habeck bei einer sicherheitspolitischen Grundsatzrede keinen Zweifel an seiner Position gelassen: \"Die Telekommunikationsinfrastruktur im Kernnetz sollte mit europ\u00e4ischer Technik gef\u00fchrt werden.\" Das w\u00fcrden einige Anbieter auch bereits heute machen \u2013 \"einer speziell nicht\", deutete Habeck mit dem Finger auf die Telekom, ohne diese zu nennen. Da die Gesetzgebung ausreichend Fristen vorsehe, \"k\u00f6nne man das jetzt auch einfach mal tun\", antwortete er bei der Bundesakademie f\u00fcr Sicherheitspolitik auf eine Frage des Botschafters Kai Sauer des Nokia-Heimatlandes Finnland.\nIm Digitalministerium wollte man eigentlich die Ergebnisse der Untersuchungen des BMI abwarten. Die Bef\u00fcrchtung, die auch aus dem Kanzleramt zu h\u00f6ren war: Bei einer voreiligen Entscheidung mit einem Zwangsaustausch von Huawei-Komponenten k\u00f6nnten die Ausbauziele der Telekommunikationsunternehmen nicht mehr erreicht werden. Digitalminister Wissings Haus hatte sich \u2013 im Sinne der betroffenen Unternehmen \u2013 \u00f6ffentlich mehrfach eher f\u00fcr die Variante eines Ausschleichens der Huawei-Abh\u00e4ngigkeit ausgesprochen. Mit der regul\u00e4ren Rotation der Sendeanlagen k\u00f6nnte Huawei dann bis 2029/30 allm\u00e4hlich aus den Mobilfunknetzen verschwinden, ohne Ausbauprobleme zu verursachen, wie sie etwa f\u00fcr das Vereinigte K\u00f6nigreich mit seinem strikten Huawei-Verbot berichtet werden. Dort war nach dem Huawei-Verbot der Ausbau ins Stocken geraten.\nEine Einigung dar\u00fcber, wie mit chinesischen Herstellern in KRITIS umzugehen ist, muss auch aus einem anderen Grund bald erfolgen: Der Gesetzesakt, in dem auch die Huawei-Frage gekl\u00e4rt werden soll, soll eigentlich in den kommenden Wochen durchs Kabinett gehen \u2013 das NIS2-Umsetzungs-und-Cybersicherheitsst\u00e4rkungs-Gesetz (NIS2UmsuCG). Dieses Vorhaben ist bereits jetzt massiv versp\u00e4tet \u2013 nicht zuletzt aufgrund der Huawei-Frage.\n(mack)", "hash": "8f0c409da4b95b2bbab4e54c86f5468bd0b26f3167c81dc0bd7815649d80f909", "id": "70f2fa07-5028-4c24-a577-b8d3b66bad2b", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/Ministertreffen-Deutscher-Umgang-mit-Huawei-bleibt-unklar-9730661.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-24T10:26:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "0122a331-6da7-499a-9fb9-572923847a84", "title": "Ministertreffen: Deutscher Umgang mit Huawei bleibt unklar\u200b"}], "tags": {"Annalena Baerbock": {"name": "Annalena Baerbock", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Australien": {"name": "Australien", "tag_type": "Country"}, "BMI": {"name": "BMI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Bundesinnenministerium": {"name": "Bundesinnenministerium", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Ericsson": {"name": "Ericsson", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "FDP": {"name": "FDP", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Finnland": {"name": "Finnland", "tag_type": "Country"}, "GR\u00dcNE": {"name": "GR\u00dcNE", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Habeck": {"name": "Habeck", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Huawei": {"name": "Huawei", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Kai Sauer": {"name": "Kai Sauer", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Nancy Faeser": {"name": "Nancy Faeser", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Nokia": {"name": "Nokia", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Olaf Scholz": {"name": "Olaf Scholz", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Robert Habeck": {"name": "Robert Habeck", "tag_type": "PER"}, "SPD": {"name": "SPD", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Telekom": {"name": "Telekom", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Vereinigte K\u00f6nigreich": {"name": "Vereinigte K\u00f6nigreich", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Volker Wissing": {"name": "Volker Wissing", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Wissings": {"name": "Wissings", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Ministertreffen: Deutscher Umgang mit Huawei bleibt unklar\u200b"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T17:12:39.561172", "id": "1d50b534-9a4f-43cc-9b9c-c5e6ecac727f", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "0"}, {"created": "2024-05-24T17:17:05.857091", "id": "2be2b413-f8ea-4b27-8aff-1273d26c62cb", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "9"}, {"created": "2024-05-24T17:15:28.408900", "id": "f2dcbceb-b979-4612-ab41-7c0a57af58dc", "key": "IOC_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-24T10:25:35", "id": "e9981b10-0b10-48f9-9f6f-6b58c24e221d", "news_items": [{"author": "Pierluigi Paganini", "content": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added a NextGen Healthcare Mirth Connect vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.\nThe issue, tracked as CVE-2020-17519, is an improper access control vulnerability in Apache Flink.\nApache Flink contains an improper access control vulnerability that allows an attacker to read any file on the local filesystem of the JobManager through its REST interface.\nAn improper access control vulnerability occurs when an application or system does not adequately restrict user permissions, allowing unauthorized users to access resources, perform actions, or obtain data they should not be able to.

The Guardian reports: The European Space Agency (Esa) launched the $1 billion observatory last summer on a six-year mission to create a 3D map of the cosmos. Armed with its images, scientists hope to understand more about the mysterious 95% of the universe that is unexplained. The first wave of scientific results come from only 24 hours of observations, which revealed 11m objects in visible light and 5m in infrared. Along with the rogue planets, the researchers describe new star clusters, dwarf galaxies and very distant, bright galaxies from the first billion years of the universe.\nA flurry of new images from the same observations are the largest ever taken in space and demonstrate the stunning wide-field views that astronomers can expect from Euclid in the coming years. Among those released on Thursday is a breathtaking image of Messier 78, a vibrant star nursery shrouded in interstellar dust, that reveals complex filaments of gas and dust in unprecedented detail. One of the newly released images shows Abell 2390, a giant conglomeration of more than 50,000 Milky Way-like galaxies. Such galaxy clusters contain up to 10 trillion times as much mass as the sun, much of which is believed to be elusive dark matter. Another image of the Abell 2764 galaxy cluster reveals hundreds of galaxies orbiting within a halo of dark matter.\nOther images capture NGC 6744, one of the largest spiral galaxies in the nearby universe, and the Dorado group of galaxies, where evolving and merging galaxies produce shell-like structures and vast, curving tidal tails. The rogue planets spotted by Euclid are about 3m years old, making them youngsters on the cosmic scale. They are at least four times as big as Jupiter and were detected thanks to the warmth they emit. Astronomers know they are free-floating because they are so far away from the nearest stars. The celestial strays are destined to drift through the galaxy unless they encounter a star that pulls them into orbit.\nA flurry of new images from the same observations are the largest ever taken in space and demonstrate the stunning wide-field views that astronomers can expect from Euclid in the coming years.

Find out how this alert can help you enhance organizational security by showing you which devices may be absent from the reports. Then let's explore how you can solve this issue.\nCurrent Windows Update for Business reports experience\nAre you using Windows Update for Business reports to gain useful insights into your compliance status? Ideally, all devices within a tenant would be included in Windows Update for Business reports after enrollment at the tenant level. But sometimes, the number of devices actively sending diagnostic data to Windows Update for Business reports is lower than expected.\nDevices don't always send data to diagnostic reports as they should. You might need to check your devices to ensure they are active and properly configured.\nWe just added a new feature to help you find these devices with the new DeviceDiagnosticDataNotReceived alert.\nA new alert for devices missing in reports\nThe DeviceDiagnosticDataNotReceived alert compares device data from Entra ID with Windows Update for Business reports to help identify devices that aren't sending diagnostic data.\nYou can use Log Analytics or Windows Update for Business reports, which are built on queries from Log Analytics, to locate missing devices. Let's see how you can work with this alert in either service.\nFind missing devices in Windows Update for Business reports\nA new feature in the Windows Update for Business reports workbook will help you see how many devices are not showing up in the reports. It also shows you which devices are not sending data.\nLet's look at how you can use active alerts to find the total count of devices and the device name, device ID, and the last login time of any missing device.\nThe missing device information is displayed in the Azure Workbooks' Overview tab, within the Total devices KPI card.\n\nGo to portal.azure.com.\nNavigate to Monitor > Workbooks > Insights.\nOpen the Windows Update for Business workbook.\nOn the Overview page, locate the Total devices KPI card.\nSelect View details.\n\nScreenshot of view of devices for which data is available in Windows Update for Business reports.\n\nExplore the Missing devices tab to see details of currently unavailable devices.\n\nScreenshot of missing devices view in Windows Update for Business reports (a mockup).\nThe Missing devices tab houses the list of devices identified by the DeviceDiagnosticDataNotReceived alert which displays information about the total count of devices currently unavailable in the report. These devices are not currently sending diagnostic data. The report also shows relevant details for these devices (device ID, and alert-specific timestamps).\n\n\n\n\nImportant: If you notice that the DeviceName field is blank or contains a \u201c#,\u201d it means that the AllowDeviceNameInDiagnosticData policy is not configured. We are working to integrate more functionality that would enable you to view the device names in Windows Update for Business reports. This is not available at present, and you would only see the DeviceName field populated for devices with this policy configured.\n\n\n\n\nThe timestamp of a device's last login, pulled from the Entra ID object, is displayed in the AlertData field.\nA search bar is available to make it easier to locate a specific device record, since the device list shows only a few rows at a time.\n\n\n\n\nImportant: The list only shows up to 250 rows of active alerts at the moment. However, you can access the complete list of results by using the export button.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the newly added Missing devices tab in the Total devices KPI card (a mockup).\nQuery the missing device data in Log Analytics\nLog Analytics lets you see the same alert information, and more. Use it to check for resolved and deleted alerts, too.\nTo find devices that don't send diagnostic data, you can query the UCDeviceAlert table in Log Analytics from Azure Monitor.\n\nGo to portal.azure.com.\nNavigate to Monitor > Logs.\n(Optional) Set the time range.\nRun the following query:\nUCDeviceAlert| where AlertSubtype == \"DeviceDiagnosticDataNotReceived\"| project DeviceName, AzureADDeviceId, AlertStatus, AlertSubtype, StartTime, AlertData, Description, Recommendation\n\n\nScreenshot of the query to find devices with an active DeviceDiagnosticDataNotReceived alert in Log Analytics (a mockup).\nThis query will display all the information that relates to the DeviceDiagnosticDataNotReceived alert. You'll see a list of alerts that are active, resolved, or deleted. To find the devices that are relevant, look at these fields: AzureADDeviceId, StartTime, and AlertData.\nFor alert details and recommended remediation steps, see the StartTime, AlertData, Description, and Recommendation fields.\n\n\n\n\nImportant: The AlertData field does not show up in the tables by default in Log Analytics. Add it specifically to your queries to include it in your query results.\n\n\n\n\nIf you need extra help, check out Log Analytics tutorial.\nCheck for appropriate configuration of diagnostic data\nUse the DeviceDiagnosticDataNotReceived alert to help you pinpoint exactly which devices need attention. Then ensure that they're active and correctly configured to send diagnostic data.\n\nMake sure the device is powered on. Use parameters like device Entra ID and Tenant ID from the alert record, along with the LastLogOnTimeStamp in Entra ID to identify device activity more precisely.\nEnsure that the device is connected to the internet.\nVerify and fix any configuration issues. Learn more about troubleshooting with Prerequisites for Windows Update for Business reports.\n\nVerify your Windows device population for reporting\nA good goal is for the total number of your devices to match the sum of these counts from Windows Update for Business reports:\n\nTotal count of devices (Overview > Total devices KPI)\nTotal count of devices with the active DeviceDiagnosticDataNotReceived alert (Overview > Total devices > View details > Missing devices)\n\nThis alert will help you find devices that need fixes. Use this information to reduce the discrepancy between the enrolled and reported devices.\nStart using the new alert today\nWe're happy to announce this new alert that will help you gain more value from Windows Update for Business reports. We encourage you to use it as you create more comprehensive and more reliable data reports. This is one of many improvements we're introducing based on your feedback, so stay tuned for more updates.\nIf you want to learn more, we invite you to check out these additional resources:\n\nSkilling snack: Windows Update for Business reports\nNow generally available: Windows Update for Business reports\nWindows Update for Business reports data schema\nOverview of Log Analytics in Azure Monitor\n\n\nContinue the conversation.

Das birgt aber Risiken. So m\u00fcssen Sch\u00e4chte, die bei der Einlagerung gegraben wurden, besonders dicht versiegelt werden. Dasselbe gilt f\u00fcr Bohrl\u00f6cher, die zur Inspektion des Lagers dienen.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Diesen Ort werden Menschen 100.000 Jahre nicht mehr betreten\nDas Problem an der Sache ist, dass diese Versiegelungen meist nicht lange halten und laufend \u00fcberpr\u00fcft und erneuert werden m\u00fcssen. Vor allem in Erdbebengebieten ist das ein Problem.\nForscher*innen der japanischen Universit\u00e4t Nagoya haben nun eine neue Methode entwickelt, mit einer neuen Art Harz die Felsen abzudichten. Die Ergebnisse wurden im Fachmagazin Communications Engineering ver\u00f6ffentlicht, wie die Universit\u00e4t in einer Mitteilung auf Eurekalert mitteilt.\nInspiriert von Fossilien\nAusgangspunkt der neuen Methode war die Konservierung von Fossilien in Kalziumkarbonat. Hidekazu Yoshida vom Nagoya University Museum bemerkte, dass sich die Fossilien innerhalb weniger Wochen bis maximal Jahre bilden und dann teilweise \u00fcber Millionen Jahre intakt bleiben, trotz Witterung und seismischer Einfl\u00fcsse.\nInspiriert von diesem Umstand entwickelten die Forscher*innen ihr Harz. Es funktioniert auf Basis von Calcit, das in den Spalten und L\u00f6chern kristallisiert. Im Vergleich zum nat\u00fcrlichen Vorgang geschieht das mit dem neuen Harz sehr viel schneller.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Hacker stehlen geheime Informationen \u00fcber Frankreichs Atomkraftwerke\nTest mit realen Erdbeben\nGetestet wurde das Material in einem unterirdischen Labor 350 Meter unter der Oberfl\u00e4che in Hokkaido, der n\u00f6rdlichsten Insel Japans. Es dichtete einerseits schnell und vollst\u00e4ndig ab und hielt andererseits 11 Erdbeben - das st\u00e4rkste mit 5.4 auf der Richterskala - stand. Alle Risse blieben verschlossen.\nDie Erdbeben seien reiner Zufall gewesen, sagte Yoshida. Sie seien aber eine gro\u00dfartige Gelegenheit gewesen, die Leistung des Materials zu testen. Herk\u00f6mmliche Materialien auf Zementbasis h\u00e4tten dem so nicht standgehalten.\nDie Forscher*innen hoffen, dass das Material k\u00fcnftig kommerziell genutzt werden kann. Neben dem Abdichten von Atomendlagern k\u00f6nnten damit auch stillgelegte \u00d6lquellen versiegelt oder Grundwassereintritt beim Bergbau abgedichtet werden. Auch die Reparatur von Rissen in alternder Infrastruktur, wie in Stra\u00dfen und Geb\u00e4ude, sei denkbar.\nKommentare", "hash": "bcd64a4410976eaae379c0534325413ae657ea02a3edc2e449f8e5ef80283e5f", "id": "415c0b21-45cb-4c8e-9221-28dd44cc37fe", "link": "https://futurezone.at/science/atommuell-lager-versiegeln-harz-neues-material-haelt-erdbeben-stand/402904241", "osint_source_id": "eec2ad26-2f4c-4dd8-a3e5-08c0eb3765ca", "published": "2024-05-24T09:55:48", "source": "https://futurezone.at/xml/rss", "story_id": "fa8b7665-b5d3-40db-8f9a-90869cf64346", "title": "Atomm\u00fcll-Lager versiegeln: Neue Dichtmasse h\u00e4lt Erdbeben stand"}], "tags": {"Frankreichs": {"name": "Frankreichs", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Hacker": {"name": "Hacker", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Hidekazu Yoshida": {"name": "Hidekazu Yoshida", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Hokkaido": {"name": "Hokkaido", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Japans": {"name": "Japans", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Nagoya": {"name": "Nagoya", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Yoshida": {"name": "Yoshida", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Atomm\u00fcll-Lager versiegeln: Neue Dichtmasse h\u00e4lt Erdbeben stand"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T17:21:14.377201", "id": "ba931c21-97ec-4cbc-aced-24640a1e8b2c", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-24T09:53:01", "id": "9025d38e-cb6f-40fc-9f3a-7d554fee7976", "news_items": [{"author": "ZDNet-Redaktion", "content": "Betr\u00fcgereien im Bereich des Fernsupports stellen ein zunehmendes Risiko f\u00fcr Verbraucher dar.

It increases the discoverability of customer devices by attackers.\nAdvisory on security impacts related to the use of TLS in proprietary vendor Dynamic DNS (DDNS) services.\nThe use of Dynamic DNS (DDNS[1]) services embedded in appliances, such as those provided by vendors like Fortinet or QNAP, carries cybersecurity implications. It increases the discoverability of customer devices by attackers.\nImagine a perfect world for an attacker, where they can precisely identify devices belonging to customers of a specific vendor, all using a product potentially riddled with known vulnerabilities or zero-day exploits.\nIn this advisory, I aim to explore how implementing a specific security technological combination (TLS and DDNS) negatively influences the overall security, inadvertently creating opportunities for attackers to exploit weaknesses on a massive scale.\nSecuring Internet communications is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of information in transit. This is typically achieved through a combination of Public Key Infrastructure (using X.509[2] certificates) and encrypted, authenticated connections (TLS[3] and its precursor, SSL[4]).\nCertificate Transparency (CT)[5] is a mechanism designed to ensure transparency in the issuance of certificates, with the main aim of spotting rogue Certification Authorities (CAs) and the issuance of fraudulent certificates[6]. The Certificate Transparency Log is a public and immutable record of all issued certificates.\nThe process of the Certificate Transparency Registry can be summarized in the following steps:\nAlthough the Certificate Transparency Log is designed to improve security and transparency, its public nature leads to known Information Disclosure risks. Attackers abuse the Certificate Transparency Log to identify subdomains (FQDNs) in order to map a target\u2019s attack surface and, consequently, exploit vulnerabilities[7].\nDynamic Domain Name System (also known as Dynamic DNS or DDNS) is a technology that allows users to link a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) with an IP address that may change over time.\nThis system consists of two main components: a DDNS client installed on the device that needs to be accessible and a DDNS server managed by a service provider.\nAlthough this type of technology is not recommended for use in SMB (Small and Medium Business) or Enterprise environments (spoiler: it often is), it is highly popular in SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) settings. In fact, an increasing number of vendors are now integrating this service into their appliances to meet this demand.\nThe combined use of these two technologies \u2013 requiring a certificate for an FQDN associated with a DDNS domain owned by a specific vendor \u2013 can lead to widespread exploitation of vulnerabilities.\nFor instance, suppose firewall manufacturer ACME Inc. offers its DDNS service under the domain \u201cacme-firewall.com\u201d.\nIf a vulnerability were discovered in this firewall, a malicious user could abuse the Certificate Transparency Log to identify vulnerable targets by querying all subdomains of \u201cacme-firewall.com\u201d. This would allow them to massively compromise thousands of exposed devices.\nFortinet has introduced the \u201cFortiGuard DDNS\u201d service in its FortiGate firewall products. While this service facilitates the setup of VPN systems in the absence of a static IP, it inadvertently encourages the exposure of the appliance\u2019s administrative interface to the Internet.\nThis DDNS service uses three Fortinet-owned domains: fortiddns.com, fortidyndns.com, and float-zone.com. It also integrates an ACME client for automatic certificate generation via Let\u2019s Encrypt[8].\nBy querying a Certificate Transparency Log service[9] for the fortiddns.com domain, an attacker can uncover over 2300 potential targets that have recently been issued TLS certificates for fortiddns.com (filtering for certificates that have not yet expired). The service used for this sample truncated the results due to an excessive number of matching entries, indicating that there are actually many more potential targets.\nHowever, Shodan[10] indexed up to 7968 targets for the same domain. Almost all of these hosts were indexed using the \u201cCommon Name\u201d field of the SSL certificate.\nQNAP offers the \u201cmyQNAPcloud\u201d service to simplify remote access to its NAS products.\nHowever, this service inadvertently encourages the exposure of these appliances to the Internet by using the proprietary DDNS myqnapcloud.com.\nThe Certificate Transparency Registry service reveals over 4400 potential targets, with search results truncated due to the large number of entries.\nShodan returns 39027 targets, all indexed through the \u201cCommon Name\u201d field of the certificate.\nThe router and switch manufacturer Mikrotik also offers a DDNS service on the sn.mynetname.net and integrates an ACME client into their appliances. The subdomain generated by this service consists of the appliance\u2019s serial number (which corresponds to the MAC address of the first network interface), for example: serialnumber.sn.mynetname.net.\nThe Certificate Transparency Log service reveals over 1300 potential targets, with the search results truncated due to the high number of entries.\nShodan, on the other hand, returns 3885 targets indexed by the Common Name field.\nWhile the easy availability (in some cases a checkbox) of DDNS in technological appliances does not automatically expose administrative interfaces and services to the Internet, it does encourage this practice. When combined with an ACME client that automatically generates an X.509 certificate for the DDNS domain, it inherently creates an information disclosure risk.\nTherefore, it is crucial for manufacturers to clearly communicate these potential security hazards to users, emphasizing the importance of cautious configuration.\nReferences and additional info are included in the original analysis available here:\nhttps://www.ush.it/2024/05/23/tls-ddns-multiple-vendor-information-disclosure/\nAbout the author: Pasquale \u2018sid\u2019 Fiorillo: Senior Security Researcher | CEH\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n(SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, Dynamic DNS (DDNS))", "hash": "cc4546dde9acc16f40934e22dec4f001fb36449d9ccc3dfc28b0598f1595c2a4", "id": "882839e9-4036-46c4-a3b4-f0d1f78c6944", "link": "https://securityaffairs.com/163617/hacking/ddns-services-leads-information-disclosure.html", "osint_source_id": "d01d5487-bebf-40c5-a433-cdbe4670e633", "published": "2024-05-24T08:58:50", "source": "http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/feed", "story_id": "a2815035-9c69-4b7d-ae87-c3b9dcf0f109", "title": "Usage of TLS in DDNS Services leads to Information Disclosure in Multiple Vendors"}], "tags": {"ACME Inc": {"name": "ACME Inc", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "CAs": {"name": "CAs", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Certification Authorities": {"name": "Certification Authorities", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "DDNS": {"name": "DDNS", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Dynamic DNS": {"name": "Dynamic DNS", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "FortiNet": {"name": "FortiNet", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Fortigate": {"name": "Fortigate", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Fortinet-owned": {"name": "Fortinet-owned", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Information Disclosure": {"name": "Information Disclosure", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Internet": {"name": "Internet", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "Mastodon": {"name": "Mastodon", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Mikrotik": {"name": "Mikrotik", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "QNAP": {"name": "QNAP", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "TLS": {"name": "TLS", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "VPN": {"name": "VPN", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "X.509": {"name": "X.509", "tag_type": "MISC"}, "zero-day": {"name": "zero-day", "tag_type": "Cybersecurity"}}, "title": "Usage of TLS in DDNS Services leads to Information Disclosure in Multiple Vendors"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T17:15:34.162734", "id": "28263532-6111-4e4b-b968-7fed7030b8a7", "key": "WORDLIST_BOT", "value": "1"}, {"created": "2024-05-24T17:22:41.413041", "id": "d4d6bf1b-82aa-4f21-9f51-63f5a981474a", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "1"}], "created": "2024-05-24T08:52:43", "id": "45416bc3-98ac-4943-913f-0e71b2319ec6", "news_items": [{"author": "", "content": "Sie nennt sich \"Blackout Challenge\" und wird gerade von Jugendlichen auf der Social-Media-Plattform Tiktok betrieben.

This new capability allows Security and DevOps teams to realize the benefits of containers securely by proactively measuring and optimizing the resilience of clusters.\nIt is the latest innovative addition to the Picus Security Validation Platform, which empowers users to consistently validate their security posture and measure risk across on-premises and multi-cloud environments.\nFor organizations that want an agile way to deploy, run and scale applications, Kubernetes offers considerable benefits. However, security is often the biggest barrier to its adoption. The dynamic and complex nature of Kubernetes means that containers are often misconfigured due to human error. Without a hands-on approach to governance, security gaps can easily emerge over time, increasing the risk of incidents.\nThis situation is exacerbated by the high level of expertise required to secure Kubernetes and the use of default settings which are inherently insecure. According to The State of Kubernetes Report, more than two-thirds of Kubernetes users (67%) have delayed deployments due to security concerns.*\nThe addition of Kubernetes validation extends the Picus platform\u2019s existing validation capabilities, which are powered by attack simulation and GenAI. It enables organizations to proactively identify and mitigate security misconfigurations, such as weak policies and settings that could allow containers to run with insecure privileges and facilitate lateral movement.\nNow security teams can automatically assess the security of their workloads wherever they are located \u2013 on-premises, in containers, and also in cloud platforms including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure.\n\u201cCloud security is perhaps the biggest barrier of entry for organizations that want to take advantage of container orchestration,\u201d said Volkan Erturk, Picus CTO. \u201cKubernetes offers incredible opportunities for DevOps teams to deploy and scale new applications, but Security teams can struggle to keep pace.\n\u201cWith the Picus Security Validation Platform, security concerns won\u2019t slow down an organization\u2019s digital transformation journey. This new offering will allow our users to consistently measure the security of their workloads and vastly reduce the effort needed to address exposures across growing IT environments.\u201d", "hash": "f32ff8cdb57fe56e0846aa41b8912ad996cf37ec3f6e362a5a4cba21b43eb74d", "id": "db84404b-9955-4c0d-aeb4-ad40a9f5a755", "link": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/05/24/picus-kubernetes-validation-capabilities/", "osint_source_id": "c5bebd4b-5715-4589-a65c-0344a226ab6f", "published": "2024-05-24T08:00:12", "source": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/feed", "story_id": "a3a7136c-a340-4286-aa14-53b727dbf315", "title": "Picus Security introduces security validation for Kubernetes"}], "tags": {"GenAI": {"name": "GenAI", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Kubernetes": {"name": "Kubernetes", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Picus Security": {"name": "Picus Security", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Volkan Erturk": {"name": "Volkan Erturk", "tag_type": "PER"}}, "title": "Picus Security introduces security validation for Kubernetes"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T09:10:51.181475", "id": "7346242e-cef5-4ba0-a103-9f528d9f5a0e", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "14"}], "created": "2024-05-24T07:56:21", "id": "0785ae2b-6a82-4446-8a76-583b2c0b6509", "news_items": [{"author": "G\u00fcnter Born", "content": "[English]Microsoft hat zum 23. Mai 2024 (also in Europa am gestrigen sp\u00e4ten Abend) das Out-of-Band-Update KB5039705 f\u00fcr Windows Server 2019 ver\u00f6ffentlicht. Dieses Sonderupdate wurde erforderlich, weil das am 14. Mai 2024 ver\u00f6ffentlichte kumulative Update KB5037765 zur\u00fcckgezogen werden musste. Das Update l\u00f6ste bei der Installation auf nicht englischsprachigen Windows Server 2019-Instanzen den Installationsfehler 0x800f0982 aus. Hier einige Informationen zu diesem Problem und dem Sonderupdate KB5039705.\nAnzeige\nOut-of-Band-Update KB5039705\nDie Information \u00fcber das Out-of-Band-Update KB5039705 erreichte mich \u00fcber die zahlreichen Leserkommentare im Beitrag Windows Server 2019: Update KB5037765 zur\u00fcckgezogen (danke daf\u00fcr). Das kumulative Update KB5039705 wurde am 23. Mai 2024 f\u00fcr Windows Server 2019 (sowie Windows 10 2019 Enterprise LTSC und IoT Enterprise LTSC ) bereitgestellt und hebt die Build auf 17763.5830. Als Korrektur wird nur angemerkt:\nDieses Update behebt ein bekanntes Problem im Zusammenhang mit dem Sprachpaket Englisch (USA). Wenn sie auf Ihrem Ger\u00e4t nicht vorhanden ist, schl\u00e4gt die Installation von KB5037765 m\u00f6glicherweise fehl. Der Fehlercode ist 0x800f0982.\nDieses Problem kann sich jedoch auf Ger\u00e4te auswirken, die \u00fcber dieses Sprachpaket verf\u00fcgen. In diesem Fall wird der Fehlercode 0x80004005.\nMicrosoft erw\u00e4hnt auch, dass das SSU KB5037017 (Servicing Stack Updates) auf die Build 17763.5695 aktualisiert wurde. Dort werden qualitative Verbesserungen angegeben. Aktuell sind Microsoft keine Probleme mit dem Update bekannt.\nDas Problem mit Update KB5037765\nBeim am 14. Mai 2024 ver\u00f6ffentlichte kumulative Update KB5037765 l\u00f6ste die Installation auf nicht englischsprachigen Windows Server 2019-Instanzen den Installationsfehler 0x800f0982 aus. Hintergrund war, dass dort das Sprachpaket en-us fehlte, welches zur Installation ben\u00f6tigt wurde. Systeme, die das Sprachpaket enthielten, erm\u00f6glichten i.d.R. dann die Installation des Update KB5037765. Microsoft hatte das Sicherheitsupdate vom 14. Mai 2024 dann zur\u00fcckgezogen.\nR\u00fcckmeldungen zum Update KB5039705\nZum Blog-Beitrag Windows Server 2019: Update KB5037765 zur\u00fcckgezogen haben sich bereits zahlreiche Leser mit Hinweisen auf das Sonderupdate gemeldet. Robert Gl\u00f6ckler hat sich bereits sehr fr\u00fch in diesem Kommentar gemeldet und berichtet, dass das 2024-05 Cumulative Update for Windows Server 2019 for x64-based Systems (KB5039705) ver\u00f6ffentlicht worden sei.\nRobert merkt an, dass das Update \"leider es auch f\u00fcr die Systeme erforderlich ist, die er \u00fcber Umwege schon mit dem ersten CU gepatcht hatte\". Das ist meiner Interpretation nach dem Umstand geschuldet, dass das Sicherheitsupdate vom 14. Mai 2024 den Fehlercode 0x80004005 ausl\u00f6sen kann, wenn das Sprachpaket en-us auf dem System vorhanden ist.\nDas Update KB5039705 sollte auf dem WSUS beim Synchronisieren angezeigt werden und kann dann auf nicht englischsprachigen Systemen installiert werden. Das fehlerhafte Update KB5037765 vom 14. Mai 2024 sollte auf dem WSUS als \"superseded\" (abgel\u00f6st) angezeigt werden. Falls wer auf WSUS Probleme haben sollte, in diesem Kommentar\nIn diesem Kommentar gibt es eine erste Best\u00e4tigung, dass das Update ohne Fehlermeldung installiert werden konnte. Ein weiterer Nutzer merkt hier an, dass die Installation (im Gegensatz zum fehlerhaften Update vom 14. Mai) erstaunlich schnell von statten gehe. Einen Neustart des Windows Server 2019 hat dieser Nutzer bisher noch nicht ausgef\u00fchrt.\nUpdate auch f\u00fcr Windows 10 2019 Enterprise\nBei meinem Windows 10 2019 IOT Enterprise LTSC wird das erw\u00e4hnte Update KB5039705 \u00fcbrigens auch angeboten, obwohl die Installation des Update KB5037765 durchgelaufen ist. Hier scheint Microsoft proaktiv das Update auszurollen, um den potentiellen Installationsfehler 0x80004005, verursacht durch das Altupdate KB5037765, auszumerzen. Ich habe die Installation aktuell aber noch nicht ausf\u00fchren lassen \u2013 mache das gleich und werde nachtragen, ob es Probleme gab.\nAnzeige\n\u00c4hnliche Artikel:\nMicrosoft Security Update Summary (14.

Bei der aktuellen Welle sind meist Produkte betroffen, die im Oktober und November 2023 gekauft wurden.\nDie erste Welle der R\u00fcckzahlungen hat im J\u00e4nner 2024 stattgefunden. Hier unser Artikel vom 29. J\u00e4nner 2024 dazu:\nViele \u00f6sterreichische Kund*innen wundern sich derzeit \u00fcber die Cent-Betr\u00e4ge, die ihnen Amazon j\u00fcngst als \"R\u00fcckerstattung\" \u00fcberwiesen hat. Wer genauer hinschaut, stellt fest, dass die jeweiligen Eink\u00e4ufe manchmal bereits Monate zur\u00fcckliegen.\nIn sozialen Medien wundern sich Betroffene, warum diese kleinen Betr\u00e4ge zur\u00fcckerstattet werden. Manche berichten sogar von mehreren \u00dcberweisungen an einem Tag.\n\u27a4 Mehr lesen: Was wurde eigentlich aus den Amazon-Superm\u00e4rkten?\n\"Technisches Problem\"\nAuf Anfrage der futurezone gibt sich Amazon vage, was hinter den \u00dcberweisungen steckt. Auf die genauen Hintergr\u00fcnde m\u00f6chte das Unternehmen nicht eingehen, die Rede ist von einem technischen Problem, das bei den K\u00e4ufen aufgetreten sei. In der schriftlichen Stellungnahme hei\u00dft es konkret: \"Aufgrund eines mittlerweile behobenen technischen Problems wurden Bestellungen mancher Kund*innen m\u00f6glicherweise nicht korrekt in Rechnung gestellt.\"\nWas genau das technische Problem war bzw. wodurch es ausgel\u00f6st wurde, l\u00e4sst Amazon im Dunklen. Auch auf erneute Nachfrage wollte ein Unternehmenssprecher keine Details dazu preisgeben. Vonseiten des Unternehmens hei\u00dft es zus\u00e4tzlich lediglich, dass man sich bei den Kund*innen entschuldige.\nAnhand der Betr\u00e4ge k\u00f6nnte das Problem mit der verrechneten Umsatzsteuer in Verbindung stehen. Diese betr\u00e4gt in Deutschland 19 Prozent, in \u00d6sterreich aber 20 Prozent. Daher werden auf Amazon.de f\u00fcr \u00d6sterreich andere Preise angezeigt als f\u00fcr deutsche Kund*innen. Wom\u00f6glich gab es auf der Amazon-Website ein Problem bei der Berechnung der \u00f6sterreichischen Preise und diese waren noch h\u00f6her als sie eigentlich sein sollten. F\u00fcr diese Theorie spricht, dass deutsche Amazon-Kund*innen von den R\u00fcckzahlungen bisher nicht betroffen sind.\nUnklar ist auch, wie viele Betroffene es insgesamt gibt oder wie hoch die gesamte Summe ist, die Amazon zur\u00fcckerstattet. Es d\u00fcrften jedoch einige sein.

Key benefits include:\nFull visibility across hybrid environments: By combining application-to-application and risk-based visibility from Illumio ZTS with the user-to-application-based visibility in Netskope ZTNA Next, organizations gain a consistent, real-time view of user-to-application and application-to-application traffic, enabling them to better understand risk end-to-end.\n-\nProtection for end users from non-compliant workloads: Combined visibility between platforms enables security teams to define Netskope policy to block access between users and potentially compromised workloads, or workloads in segmented environments, increasing resilience across the organization.\n-\nDynamic ZTNA policy: Netskope\u2019s security policies are automatically updated based on metadata from Illumio, eliminating the need to rewrite rules as workload attributes change, ensuring users and critical applications are always protected and allowing organizations to scale their Zero Trust architecture.\n-\nWith ransomware attacks on the rise and IBM data showing the cost of breaches increasing to $4.45 million, organizations are turning towards Zero Trust solutions to strengthen resilience. ZTNA is already widely adopted with Gartner seeing \u201cstrong adoption among large organizations and midmarket organizations.\u201d Adoption of microsegmentation is also expected to rise rapidly; Gartner predicts that \u201cby 2026, 60 percent of enterprises working toward Zero Trust architecture will use more than one deployment form of microsegmentation, up from less than 5% in 2023.\u201d\n\u201cBusinesses today are under pressure to ensure that the right people have the right access to the right online resources, and that requires applying zero trust principles to every interaction with those resources. Our partnership with Illumio ensures that the Netskope One platform learns additional, needed context around private workload posture to help inform and reinforce the security with which private applications and workloads are accessed,\u201d said David Willis, VP of Technology Alliances at Netskope.\n\u201cOrganizations need their Zero Trust technologies to share context so that they have the same view of the environment they\u2019re protecting and can update policies accordingly,\u201d said Mario Espinoza, CPO at Illumio.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what the Illumio and Netskope integration does \u2013 Illumio provides Netskope with the needed context to prevent remote users from accessing compromised workloads, while also protecting potentially non-compliant internal workloads from remote access, stopping breaches from spreading.

You\u2019ll need a Vulnerability Disclosure Program!\nIf you are distributing or selling smart devices in to the UK market, your products will need to be compliant with the UK Product Security and Telecommunications Act.\nOne of the three mandatory areas is that you have a vulnerability disclosure program (VDP)\nIn the supporting materials for the Act, the description is as follows:\nInformation on how to report security issues\nThe manufacturer must provide information on how to report to them security issues about their product. The manufacturer must also provide information on the timescales within which an acknowledgment of the receipt of the report and status updates until the resolution of the reported security issues can be expected by person making the report.\nThis information should be made available without prior request in English, free of charge. It should also be accessible, clear and transparent.\nSo where on earth do you start?\nI\u2019ve spent over 20 years disclosing vulnerabilities to organisations and now run courses, teaching how to run a successful VDP. Here\u2019s a brief summary that should get you started.\nStep 1: RFC 9116\nRFC 9116 is a file format to aid in security vulnerability disclosure.\nPublish a security.txt file on your web site with details of how and where you would like vulnerabilities to be reported to.\nLink to your vulnerability disclosure policy\nStep 2: write your vulnerability disclosure policy\nDescribe how you will behave in response to a security report and stick by it.\nBe fair and open, always take the moral and ethical high ground.\nAsk how you would like the reporter to behave.\nThere are many examples of policies, but you need to customise yours to suit your organisation. Take advice and engage the teams who will be part of the respond to vulnerability reports.\nHere are a few you might review to get started:\nUK Gov: https://www.gov.uk/help/report-vulnerability\nUS FCC: https://www.fcc.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy\nUS CISA: https://www.cisa.gov/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-process\nNestle: https://www.nestle.com/ask-nestle/our-company/answers/vulnerability-disclosure-program\nStep 3: allocate resources to your VDP\nYou receive a report. What next?\nSomeone needs to be responsible and accountable for taking the lead. Who is that?\nWho is responsible for internal and external communication?\nWho is responsible for triage?\nWho is responsible for fixing the issue?\nStep 4: empower the team who run your VDP\nThis is a really common failing: getting priority from development teams to address security flaws is hard!\nIt\u2019s also hard for organisations to appreciate the reputational damage that can come from mishandled vulnerabilities.\nWho has the power to escalate issues? Who will listen to them?\nAt its simplest, does the team have the ear of people who can make decisions to take important revenue generating systems down whilst critical vulnerabilities are fixed?\nStep 5: run training across your organisation about your VDP\nIt\u2019s hard for dev teams and product owners to hear that their product isn\u2019t perfect.\nRun training and awareness sessions, so your teams understand that curve-ball requests might come in at short notice.\nStep 6: stress test your VDP\nSubmit a vulnerability report yourself at a weird time of day. Does your process work?\nWere you communicated with as expected? Did the triage process work and were responses sent to the researcher in the timeframe promised in your VDP?\nYou could even run a table top exercise where injects are presented to be dealt with in real time by your team. It\u2019s a great fun exercise!\nGotchas\nYou don\u2019t get to dictate what the reporter does with the vulnerability they\u2019ve found. You can only ask and potentially incentivise responsible behaviours\nHence, NDAs are a no-no. Many researchers will be irked if you ask for a non disclosure agreement\nDon\u2019t forget to say \u2018thanks\u2019 and potentially offer swag.\nDon\u2019t forget to communicate with the reporter, regularly.\nDon\u2019t spook the reporter with legal threats, unless they\u2019ve stepped well over an ethical line, perhaps through copying excess data or threatening extortion.\nOutsourcing your VDP\nMany of the bug bounty (BB) platforms offer to manage your VDP for you. Use caution!\nBB platforms are commercially motivated businesses: they will want the reporter to agree to terms that usually prevent disclosure, in exchange for payment of a bounty. They typically have a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach that doesn\u2019t always work for many researchers and reporters.\nThis works, sometimes. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t. The motivations for the BB platform are different to yours and different to the reporter\u2019s motivations. This can cause issues for all.\nYou MUST have the ability to receive direct vulnerability reports in to your organisation too. Some researchers will not want to go via a BB-managed VDP as the terms aren\u2019t acceptable.\nConclusion\nReceiving and handling vulnerability reports doesn\u2019t have to be a stressful experience, you just need to create a policy, allocate resources to it and then stress test it.\nThis is a very quick introductory guide, if you need more guidance or advice, do drop me a line on X / Twitter @TheKenMunroShow.", "hash": "a39614baa0aefdd2a0419b72181feb0dbf06328f00f75b5ba1e9f3249a9a3b3b", "id": "332d635a-e2ce-45b8-8046-ca7c34db52ec", "link": "https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/uk-psti-youll-need-a-vulnerability-disclosure-program/", "osint_source_id": "b2401f26-6b63-4e6a-9aea-074440d58a05", "published": "2024-05-24T05:52:34", "source": "https://www.pentestpartners.com/feed/", "story_id": "34ccaa84-7cd2-4e0a-bc42-1bacc1c08709", "title": "UK PSTI?

It is a high-severity 'type confusion' in V8, Chrome's JavaScript engine responsible for executing JS code.\n\"Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2024-5274 exists in the wild,\" the company said in the security advisory.\nA \"type confusion\" vulnerability occurs when a program allocates a piece of memory to hold a certain type of data but mistakenly interprets the data as a different type. This can lead to crashes, data corruption, as well as arbitrary code execution.\nGoogle has not shared technical details about the flaw to protect users from potential exploitation attempts from other threat actors and allow them to install a browser version that addresses the problem.\n\"Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven't yet fixed,\" said the tech giant.\nFix available on Chrome Stable\nGoogle's fix is being rolled out to Chrome's Stable channel in version 125.0.6422.112/.113 for Windows and Mac, while Linux users will get the update on version 125.0.6422.112 in the coming weeks.\nChrome installs important security updates automatically and they take effect after relaunching the browser. Users can confirm they are using the latest version in the About section of the Settings menu.\nIf an update is available, users should wait for the update process to finish and then click on the 'Relaunch' button to apply it.\nThird actively exploited zero-day this month\nCVE-2024-5274 is the eighth actively exploited vulnerability that Google fixed in Chrome since the beginning of the year, and the third this month.\nAt the same time, Google's previous decision to reduce the delivery of Chrome security updates from twice to once a week addresses the patch gap problem that gives threat actors extra time to exploit zero-day flaws.\nActively exploited zero-day flaws in Chrome that have been patched earlier this year are:\nCVE-2024-0519: A high-severity out-of-bounds memory access weakness within the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, allowing remote attackers to exploit heap corruption via a specially crafted HTML page, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n-\nCVE-2024-2887: A high-severity type confusion flaw in the WebAssembly (Wasm) standard. It could lead to remote code execution (RCE) exploits leveraging a crafted HTML page.\n-\nCVE-2024-2886: A use-after-free vulnerability in the WebCodecs API used by web applications to encode and decode audio and video. Remote attackers exploited it to perform arbitrary reads and writes via crafted HTML pages, leading to remote code execution.\n-\nCVE-2024-3159: A high-severity vulnerability caused by an out-of-bounds read in the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. Remote attackers exploited this flaw using specially crafted HTML pages to access data beyond the allocated memory buffer, resulting in heap corruption that could be leveraged to extract sensitive information.\n-\nCVE-2024-4671: A high-severity use-after-free flaw in the Visuals component that handles the rendering and displaying content in the browser.\n-\nCVE-2024-4761: An out-of-bounds write problem in Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which is responsible for executing JS code in the application.\n-\nCVE-2024-4947: High-severity type confusion weakness in the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution on the target device.\n-\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

We might be seeing a new leap forward in this wild new haptic glove design from the Future Interfaces Group at Carnegie Mellon University.\nThe glove gives each fingertip and thumb a small haptic pad. The pads are driven by electro-osmotic pumps, which are effectively solid-state. They use electricity to move fluid to create small dimples on the pad to provide haptic feedback to the user. The pads have 20 pixels per square centimeter, are quick and responsive, and can deform up to 0.5 mm in less than half a second.\nThe lightweight and self-contained electro-osmotic pads mean the haptic system can be far lighter and more practical than designs that use solenoids or other traditional technologies. The device is also high resolution enough that a user can feel pressure from a surface or the edges of an object in VR. If you watch the video, some of the demonstrations are quite revolutionary.\nWe\u2019ve seen some other great haptics projects before too, like these low-cost force feedback gloves.

Swimlane surveyed 500 cybersecurity decision-makers at enterprise companies with at least 1,000 employees in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\u201cGeopolitical turmoil and complex regulations have made cybersecurity a strategic imperative,\u201d said Michael Lyborg, CISO at Swimlane. \u201cWhile regulations are driving strategy shifts and increased budgets, the talent shortage and fragmented infrastructure remain obstacles to compliance and resilience. To succeed, organizations must find the right balance between human expertise for complex situations and AI-enhanced automation tools for routine tasks. This will alleviate operational strain and ensure security professionals can focus on the parts of the job where human judgment is irreplaceable.\u201d\nRegulations fuel strategy shifts\n93% of organizations report rethinking their cybersecurity strategy in the past year due to the rise of new regulations, with 58% stating they have completely reconsidered their approach. The strategy shifts are also impacting the roles of cybersecurity decision-makers, with 45% citing significant new responsibilities.\n92% of organizations reported an increase in their allocated budgets. Among these organizations, a significant portion (36%) witnessed budget increases of 20% to 49%, and a notable 23% saw increases exceeding 50%.\nMany organizations still doubt their compliance readiness, with only 40% feeling confident their organization has made the necessary investments in resources, tools, and personnel to fully comply with relevant cybersecurity regulations. A concerning 19% said their organization has done very little.\n56% of companies stated they could report security incidents to investors, boards, and regulators within 1-2 business days. However, 43% of respondents report increased reporting time over the past year.\nOnly about one-third of respondents expressed full confidence in their organization\u2019s current ability to meet the CRA\u2019s key requirements.\nAI regulation demands and privacy concerns\n83% of respondents believe there should be regulations on the development and use of AI.

For example, while 81% of risk management groups claim sole responsibility for the risk management area of a GRC program, 40% of cybersecurity teams and 37% of compliance teams play vital supporting roles to maximize the success of risk management activity.\nIn addition, the report found that as the number of GRC software solutions being used by an organization increases, the efficacy of those solutions at proactively managing risk declines (59% of organizations using just one GRC solution strongly agreed that their software is effective at proactively managing risk, whereas only 15% of organizations using two GRC solutions had the same sentiment). It also found that leveraging one comprehensive GRC tool is more cost-effective, as organizations using two or more solutions spend 21% more to run their GRC program than those using a single solution.\nThe amount organizations spend on GRC varies between industries and organizational sizes, with the largest organizations spending the least due to their ability to achieve economies of scale. Looking at significant industry differences, financial services organizations spend a median of 1.13% of total annual revenue on GRC, while healthcare spends just 0.41%.\nThis is somewhat surprising, as recent data indicates that the average cost of a healthcare breach is $10.93 million \u2013 far and away the highest of any industry, with finance a distant second at $5.90 million.

In fact, when production peaks, prices have slid well below zero. On average, the price received was 9.1 euros per megawatt-hour, significantly under the 70.6 euros paid during non-solar-power hours. \"This is what happens to power prices when the volume of unregulated power becomes equally big or bigger than demand: Prices collapse when unregulated power produces the most,\" the Swedish bank wrote on Tuesday.\nLast year's record wave of solar installations are what's driving Germany's price \"destruction\" as inventory outpaces consumption.

The difference between the two actually widens even more in the summer, a season of peak production and lower demand. This also means that consumers are not necessarily benefiting from the low prices, as they typically consume more energy in non-solar hours. Unless new installations are spurred on by subsidies or power purchase agreements, oppressed profitability could eventually halt Germany's solar expansion, Schieldrop said.\nInstead, focus is likely to move onto improvements that will make more use of the energy produced, such as investments in batteries and grid infrastructure. \"This will over time exhaust the availability of 'free power' and drive solar-hour-power-prices back up,\" Schieldrop wrote. \"This again will then eventually open for renewed growth in solar power capacity growth.\"\nLast year's record wave of solar installations are what's driving Germany's price \"destruction\" as inventory outpaces consumption.

You might design something in CAD, print it, then test it on a rig. You\u2019ll then note down your measurements, and repeat the process again. But what if a robot could do all that instead, and do it for years on end? That\u2019s precisely what\u2019s been going on at Boston University.\nInside the College of Engineering, a robotic system has been working to optimize a shape to better absorb energy. The system first 3D prints a shape, and stores a record of its shape and size. The shape is then crushed with a small press while the system measures how much energy it took to compress. The crushed object is then discarded, and the robot iterates a new design and starts again.\nThe experiment has been going on for three years continuously at this point. The MAMA BEAR robot has tested over 25,000 3D prints, which now fill dozens of boxes. It\u2019s not frivolous, either. According to engineer Keith Brown, the former record for a energy-absorbing structure was 71% efficiency. The robot developed a structure with 75% efficiency in January 2023, according to his research paper.\nWho needs humans when the robots are doing the science on their own?

For example, the effects of the layer line weaknesses in the 3d printer parts won\u2019t translate to other manufacturing methods.\nI have to wonder how much design of experiment (DOE) has taken place for this study. I remember going to a conference for additive manufacturing for use in aerospace where I heard a really interesting talk about the challenges of analyzing printed parts for strength and margins of safely- my biggest takeaway being that the increase in number of parameters (layer height, orientation, infill geometry etc.) makes it very difficult to compare parts even if they have the same geometry and material (not so good if one needs to reliably predict failures). Given that, I have a hard time seeing these results scale for other applications. Then again, a really well designed experiment may be able to make some generalized inferences for improving efficiency (especially with 25000 samples). It could be the samples are architected to identify the appropriate gradients for improving efficiency in the high dimensional parameter space. Alternatively, I could see this being immensely useful as ground truth for validating simulation models which, (once validated) can be used to brute force the parameter space much more quickly to find the optimal shape.\nI\u2019ll keep this article handy when my boss comes to me asking why the first prototype PCB of a project has minor issues and isn\u2019t perfect.\nWould you prefer a machine, which would iterate it over 9 billion prototypes?

Workspaces are region-bound, but workspace replication allows you to create cross-regional redundancy to increase workspace resilience to regional incidents.\n \nWhat is Workspace Replication?\nWorkspace replication creates a replica of your workspace on another region, that you chose from a set of regions. The original instance of your workspace is referred to as the primary workspace, and the replica on the second region is referred to as secondary.\nThe second instance of your workspace is created by the service with the same ID and configuration as your primary workspace (future configuration changes you make will be synced as well). This is basically an active-passive setup \u2013 at any given time, your workspace has one active instance, and another one that is updated in the background and can\u2019t be directly managed or accessed.\nThe secondary instance of your workspace is created empty, logs that were ingested to your workspace before enabling replication are not copied over. When replication is enabled, new logs ingested to your workspace are replicated, so they are sent to both primary and secondary workspaces. This means your workspace has cross-regional redundancy.\nIf an incident impacts your primary workspace, causing issues like ingestion latency or query failures, you can trigger failover, to switch to your secondary workspace, which can allow you to continue monitoring your resources and apps as needed. By the time you switch to your secondary workspace, it will hold logs ingested since the time you enabled replication, so you can continue using alerts, workbooks and even Sentinel or other services that query your logs.\nWhen the outage is mitigated and your primary workspace is healthy again, you can switch back to your primary region.\n \nNote that replication isn\u2019t free of charge, but is much more affordable than dual homing (ingesting to two workspaces places on different regions) and is easier to manage and maintain. When you enable replication, your logs are effectively ingested to 2 different regions, and billing is done per replicated GB. You can apply replication to a subset of your Data Collection Rules (DCRs) to control the replication volume, and related costs. See the Azure Monitor pricing page for more information.\n \nWhat Workspace replication is not\nWorkspace replication is not a mechanism to copy a workspace and its content to another region, or move it.\n\nLogs that were ingested to your primary workspace before enabling replication aren\u2019t copied over\nYour secondary workspace can\u2019t exist if the primary is deleted.\nWhen switching to the secondary workspace, you can\u2019t change workspace settings, including its schema (add tables or columns). These operations can only be done on the primary workspace.\n\n \nWhy not use availability zones instead?\nAvailability zones provide redundancy of your workspace infrastructure across zones in a single region, and this is always recommended. Workspace replication doesn\u2019t replace availability zones, it works differently, as it creates a replica of your workspace and new incoming logs on another region. This is valuable because:\n\nNot all regions support availability zones. If your zone doesn\u2019t have availability zones or the Azure Log Analytics service doesn\u2019t yet use availability zones in your region \u2013 Workspace replication is the best way to create redundancy for your workspace operation.\nSome customers require protection against incidents impacting the entire region. Availability zones are zones inside the same region. Yet, if an issue (even a bug) impacts the entire region, switching zones will not help.\n\n \nFrequently asked questions\n \nWho triggers the region switching? Is it done automatically?\nSwitching between regions isn\u2019t done by Azure Monitor, and can only be triggered by you. This is because different incidents impact different workspaces to different degrees, and only you can decide when it\u2019s time to switch over. For example, a 2-minute latency in ingestion of a specific data type may be a minor issue for some customers, but very significant to others.\nYou can create alert rules that will automatically switch regions according to ingestion latency, query success rate or other health measurements. Yet, we recommend that alerts be notify someone that will evaluate the situation and make an informed decision.\n \nDo I need to reconfigure all my clients to support this?\nNo, you don\u2019t need to reconfigure anything. The DNS will reroute all requests sent to the workspace to instead reach the secondary workspace.\n \nDoes it replicate the workspace with my data?\nNo. Only logs ingested after you enable replication will be replicated to your secondary workspace. Logs ingested before your enabled replication are not copied over.\n \nBut what if my workspace is linked to a dedicated cluster?\nCluster replication will be supported soon. We\u2019ll share an update when this capability becomes available.\n \nWhat about Sentinel, LogicApp and other services that use my workspace? Will they break when I switch regions?\nServices and features that use your workspace continue working against the secondary workspace, seamlessly. Note switching regions allows your workspace operation to carry on, but it doesn\u2019t handle other components of these services.\nFor more information, see the Workspace Replication documentation.", "hash": "007a8709b932575396d515e2dae1b3b9f1d32c44e64684549e8d60f4278c51db", "id": "108e0960-9e0e-442d-bd08-a14d753801bc", "link": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/public-preview-log-analytics-workspace-replication/ba-p/4150933", "osint_source_id": "0c4fb663-1b11-4849-bc50-10a20eb1496b", "published": "2024-05-24T00:54:10", "source": "https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/plugins/custom/microsoft/o365/custom-blog-rss?tid=-1562856755638734148&amp;board=Exchange&amp;label=Security&amp;messages=&amp;size=30", "story_id": "c1d141a9-557f-4d56-aadd-33a76de28c83", "title": "Public Preview: Log Analytics Workspace Replication"}], "tags": {"LogicApp": {"name": "LogicApp", "tag_type": "ORG"}}, "title": "Public Preview: Log Analytics Workspace Replication"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T01:20:20.740257", "id": "42911c6a-5bf7-46cb-95ce-b49d1d0262bb", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "11"}], "created": "2024-05-24T00:45:00", "id": "873f85b0-24a4-422d-8d51-4160bd52c4cb", "news_items": [{"author": "BeauHD", "content": "Mark Zuckerberg Assembles Team of Tech Execs For AI Advisory Council (qz.com)\nAn anonymous reader quotes a report from Quartz: Mark Zuckerberg has assembled some of his fellow tech chiefs into an advisory council to guide Meta on its artificial intelligence and product developments.

Its members include: Stripe CEO and co-founder Patrick Collison, former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke, and former Microsoft executive and investor Charlie Songhurst.\n\"I've come to deeply respect this group of people and their achievements in their respective areas, and I'm grateful that they're willing to share their perspectives with Meta at such an important time as we take on new opportunities with AI and the metaverse,\" Zuckerberg wrote in an internal note to Meta employees, according to Bloomberg. The advisory council differs from Meta's 11-person board of directors because its members are not elected by shareholders, nor do they have fiduciary duty to Meta, a Meta spokesperson told Bloomberg. The spokesperson said that the men will not be paid for their roles on the advisory council.

Es geht um mehr als hohe Geb\u00fchren.\nEine gro\u00dfe Kartellrechtsklage gegen Live Nation und dessen Tochter Ticketmaster erheben die US-Regierung, der Hauptstadtbezirk District of Columbia und 29 Bundesstaaten. Sie beschuldigen den Veranstaltungskonzern zahlreicher Verletzungen von Kartellrecht und fordern die Spaltung des Konzerns, zumindest den Verkauf von Ticketmaster. Live Nation stellt einen Teil der Vorw\u00fcrfe in Abrede, und beschreibt anderes vorgeworfenes Verhalten als branchen\u00fcblich.\nDie Vorw\u00fcrfe sind umfassend: Live Nation und Ticketmaster w\u00fcrden sowohl Verbraucher als auch K\u00fcnstler, Veranstalter und Veranstaltungseinrichtungen rechtswidrig unter Druck setzen und ausnehmen. \"Fans zahlen h\u00f6here Geb\u00fchren; K\u00fcnstler haben weniger Gelegenheiten f\u00fcr Konzerte; kleinere Veranstalter werden aus dem Markt gedr\u00e4ngt; und Veranstaltungseinrichtungen haben weniger echte Auswahl bei Kartenvertriebsdienstleistern\", fasst US-Justizminister Merrick Garland zusammen.\nDer Konzern, der sich selbst als gr\u00f6\u00dfter Live-Veranstalter bezeichnet, habe sich besondere Marktmacht verschafft, die er nun rechtswidrig ausnutze. Verbraucher w\u00fcrden dabei durch \"exorbitante Geb\u00fchren\" entreichert, darunter \"ticketing fees, service fees, convenience fees, platinum fees, pricemaster fees, per-order fees, handling fees, and payment processing fees - unter anderen\", f\u00fchrt Garland aus. Gleichzeitig bremse die Marktmacht Ticketmasters technische Innovation, weshalb Fans unter veralteter Technik litten.\nSelbst verst\u00e4rkender Kreislauf\nDie angeprangerten Gesch\u00e4ftsmethoden reichen aber viel weiter. Das US-Justizministerium beschreibt einen selbstverst\u00e4rkenden Kreislauf. Sie n\u00e4hmen \"Geb\u00fchren und Ums\u00e4tze von Konzertbesuchern und Sponsoring, nutzen diese Einnahmen um K\u00fcnstler in exklusive Veranstaltungsvertr\u00e4ge zu sperren, und nutzen dieses starke Portfolio dann, um Veranstaltungsorte zur Unterzeichnung langer Exklusivvertr\u00e4ge f\u00fcr den Kartenvertrieb zu bringen, was den Kreislauf fortsetzt\", fasst die Pressemitteilung des Ministeriums zusammen. Die Exklusivvertr\u00e4ge umfassen demnach mehr als 400 K\u00fcnstler und mehr als 70 Prozent aller gro\u00dfen Veranstaltungslokale in den USA.\nZum Beispiel kaufe Live Nation immer wieder kleinere regionale Veranstalter sowie Veranstaltungsorte auf. Das Unternehmen stellt das gar nicht in Abrede, will darin aber kein rechtswidriges Verhalten erkennen. Gleichzeitig sei Live Nation der mit Abstand gr\u00f6\u00dfte Eigent\u00fcmer gro\u00dfer Veranstaltungsorte in den USA, insbesondere Freiluftb\u00fchnen.\nWolle ein unabh\u00e4ngiger Veranstalter den Kartenvertriebspartner wechseln, drohe Live Nation/Ticketmaster mit Vergeltung, beispielsweise den Entzug der exklusiv an Live Nation gebundenen K\u00fcnstler. Live Nation stellt das in Abrede und verweist darauf, wegen fr\u00fcherer Verst\u00f6\u00dfe bereits einen amtlichen Beobachter zu haben, der nur einen einzigen Verdachtsfall gemeldet habe, der noch dazu auf falschen Behauptungen eines Veranstaltungslokals beruhe. Die Vertr\u00e4ge mit Veranstaltungsorten, die diesen die Nutzung anderer Kartenvertriebsorganisationen verbieten, bestreitet Ticketmaster nicht. Doch seien diese Exklusivvertr\u00e4ge keineswegs wettbewerbsfeindlich, sondern Ergebnis von Wettbewerb und von den Veranstaltungsorten so gew\u00fcnscht.\nKartellvorwurf\nEin weiterer Vorwurf lautet, dass der Konzern Vertr\u00e4ge mit Mitbewerbern schlie\u00dfe, um diese von konkurrierendem Verhalten abzubringen. Live Nation bezeichnet dies als unwahr. \u00dcberhaupt sei ihr Marktanteil seit 2010 sinkend, und was die gescholtenen Geb\u00fchren anbelange, verbleibe der Gro\u00dfteil gar nicht bei dem Konzern.\nDie hohen Preise seien das Ergebnis hoher Produktionskosten, der Beliebtheit der K\u00fcnstler, und rund um die Uhr t\u00e4tigen Schwarzh\u00e4ndlern, die beweisen w\u00fcrden, dass das Volk bereit sei, deutlich h\u00f6here Preise zu zahlen. \u00dcbrigens seien die Geb\u00fchren bei konkurrierenden Kartensystemen noch h\u00f6her. Als L\u00f6sung schl\u00e4gt der bei Live Nation f\u00fcr Regulierung zust\u00e4ndige Manager Dan Wall ein Gesetz vor, das K\u00fcnstlern erlaubt, einen H\u00f6chstpreis f\u00fcr den Weiterverkauf von Eintrittskarten festzulegen. Auch f\u00fcr diesen Zweitmarkt beitreibt der Konzern eine Onlineplattform.\nDas Verfahren hei\u00dft USA et al v Live Nation Entertainment et Ticketmaster und ist unter dem Aktenzeichen 1:24-cv-03973 am US-Bundesbezirksgericht f\u00fcr das s\u00fcdliche New York anh\u00e4ngig.\n(ds)", "hash": "bf4f241e35b236a8bff1022f8a57f319392b5697f870ca524d7d5cfb1e99769c", "id": "cb6abefc-9798-4afa-8a75-86b263c0eba9", "link": "https://www.heise.de/news/USA-verklagen-Ticketmaster-wegen-Monopolmissbrauchs-9730429.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.atom.beitrag.beitrag", "osint_source_id": "d37999dd-31d9-4ef8-8675-185f97752b44", "published": "2024-05-24T00:01:00", "source": "https://www.heise.de/rss/heise-atom.xml", "story_id": "17a77f34-5af8-442a-bf2a-37f2210c368a", "title": "USA verklagen Ticketmaster wegen Monopolmissbrauchs"}], "tags": {"Columbia": {"name": "Columbia", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "Dan Wall": {"name": "Dan Wall", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Garland": {"name": "Garland", "tag_type": "PER"}, "Live Nation": {"name": "Live Nation", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "Merrick Garland": {"name": "Merrick Garland", "tag_type": "PER"}, "New York": {"name": "New York", "tag_type": "LOC"}, "PLATINUM": {"name": "PLATINUM", "tag_type": "APT"}, "Ticketmaster": {"name": "Ticketmaster", "tag_type": "ORG"}, "USA": {"name": "USA", "tag_type": "LOC"}}, "title": "USA verklagen Ticketmaster wegen Monopolmissbrauchs"}, {"attributes": [{"created": "2024-05-24T09:14:28.608168", "id": "c0ad7d05-c26c-4626-b48b-98d805a32e5f", "key": "NLP_BOT", "value": "10"}], "created": "2024-05-24T00:00:00", "id": "1fde25d6-8f5c-4766-9f32-2f0a25d059e7", "news_items": [{"author": "glaucia_lemos86", "content": "\n \nAnother excellent session was held during the Azure Developers JavaScript Day 2024 event! This time, the focus was on Playwright. But, what is Playwright? And, what are the best practices for using it? Let's find out with the talk \"Playwright in Action: From Setup to Best Practices\"! Made by Max Schmitt, Software Engineer on the Playwright team at Microsoft and Stefan Judis, Playwright Ambassador!\n \nIntroduction\n \nDuring the Azure Develoeprs JavaScript Day 2024, Max and Stefan, presented a session titled \"Playwright in Action: From Setup to Best Practices\". They provided a comprehensive overview of Playwright, a browser automation library, and demonstrated how to leverage it for creating robust, end-to-end tests for modern web applications.\n \nIf you couldn't make it to the lecture, no problem! You can check out the video below:\n \n\n \n \nWhat is Playwright?\n \n\n \nPlaywright is an end-to-end test automation tool for web applications. It allows you to write scripts to simulate a user's interaction with your application.\n \nWhat's more, Playwright allows you to test your application in different browsers, devices, and scenarios. This is possible because Playwright is a multi-browser tool, meaning you can test your application in different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.\n \nPlaywright Features\n\u00a0\nPlaywright has several features that make it a powerful tool for automating web application testing. Some of Playwright's main features are:\n\u00a0\n\n\nCross-browser and cross-platform support: Playwright supports all modern rendering engines (Chromium, WebKit, Firefox) and runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, both headless and headed.\n\n\nLanguage versatility: Playwright's API can be used with\u00a0Node.js,\u00a0Python,\u00a0.NET, and\u00a0Java, allowing broad accessibility for developers.\n\n\nResilient testing: Playwright's auto-wait and web-first assertions eliminate flaky tests by ensuring elements are ready for interaction and retrying checks until conditions are met. Tracing features help configure test retries and capture execution details.\n\n\nFull test isolation and fast execution: Playwright creates a new browser context for each test, equivalent to a new browser profile, ensuring complete test isolation with minimal overhead. Authentication states can be saved and reused across tests.\n\n\nPowerful tooling: Playwright includes tools like Codegen for generating tests by recording actions, Playwright inspector for exploring and debugging tests, and Trace Viewer for comprehensive test failure investigation with screencasts, DOM snapshots, and action explorers.\n\n\n\u00a0\nPlaywright is also fully open-source, boasting almost 60,000 start on\u00a0GitHub\u00a0and 3,000 forks contributed by the community.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nGetting Started with Playwright\n\u00a0\nVisual Studio Code Extension for Playwright\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMax and Stefan highlighted the Visual Studio Code Extension for Playwright, which simplifies the setup process. The extension allows developers to create new projects, write, generate, raun and debug tests directly from the editor. It as almost half a million downloads, making it a popular choice among developers.\n\u00a0\nIf you want to know how to use the Visual Studio Code extension for Playwright, check out the video below:\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nOr if you prefer, you can read the official Playwright documentation:\u00a0Getting Started - Vs Code.\n\u00a0\nInstalling Playwright\n\u00a0\nTo get started, you can use the command\u00a0Install Playwright -> Test: Install Playwright\u00a0directly from the Visual Studio Code Extension for Playwright. This command sets up the project, installs Playwright and the necessary browsers, and creates essential files such as\u00a0package.json,\u00a0playwright.config.ts, and example test files.\n\u00a0\nWriting Your Fist Test\n\u00a0\nMax demonstrated how to write a test in Playwright. The syntax is straightforward and familiar to those who have used JavaScript testing libraries like Jest.\n\u00a0\nFor example, during the session, Max presented a test that was automatically generated by the extension. It is contained in the\u00a0test -> example.spec.ts\u00a0folder. The test checks if the page title is \"Playwright\".\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest('has title', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');\n\n  await expect(page).toHaveTitle('/Playwright/');\n});\n\ntest('get started link', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');\n\n  await page.getBodyRole('link', { name: 'Get Started' }).click();\n\n  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Installation' })).toBeVisible();\n});\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat does this test do?\n\nNavigates to the page\u00a0https://playwright.dev/.\nChecks if the page title is \"Playwright\".\nClicks on the \"Get Started\" link.\nChecks if the page title is \"Installation\".\nIf all steps are successful, the test passes.\n\n\u00a0\nTest it for yourself! Run the above test on your Playwright project sample and see the results.\n\u00a0\nLocators in Playwright\n\u00a0\nStefan explained the concept of\u00a0locators\u00a0in Playwright, which are used to identify elements on a web page. Playwright introduces 'get by' locators, which are more intuitive and aligned with accessibility standards. These locators are essential for writing robust tests that mimic user interactions.\n\u00a0\nExamples of Locator\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nconst locator = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Get started' });\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis locator identifies a button with the text 'Get started'. Combining locators with actions (like clicks) and assertions (like visibility checks) forms the foundation of Playwright tests.\n\u00a0\nHave a look at the\u00a0Playwright documentation\u00a0for more information on locators.\n\u00a0\nRunning and Debugging Tests\n\u00a0\nMax and Stefan demonstrated how to run tests using Playwright extension in Visual Studio Code. By enabling the \"Show Browser\" option, developers can see the tests running in a browser window. This visual feedback is helpful for debugging and understanding test execution.\n\u00a0\nPlaywright integrates seamlessly with VS Code's debugging tools. Developers can set breakpoints, inspect variables, and hover over locators to see the corresponding elements highlighted in the browser.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nRecording Tests with Codegen\n\u00a0\nThe Playwright extension offers a\u00a0Record New\u00a0feature, allowing developers to interact with a browser window while Playwright generates the corresponding test code. This feature simplifies the process of writing tests and ensures accurate element selection.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nAdvanced Features: Trace Viewer and GitHub Integration\n\u00a0\nPlaywright Trace Viewer\n\u00a0\nThe\u00a0Trace Viewer in Playwright\u00a0provides detailed insights into each test run. It shows before, during, and after snapshots of each action, complete with DOM snapshots, console logs, and network requests. This level of detail is invaluable for debugging complex issues.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThere is a video available that shows how to use the Trace Viewer. You can check the video below:\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGitHub Actions Integration\n\u00a0\nMax and Stefan demonstrated how to integrate Playwright tests with\u00a0GitHub Actions. By setting up a GitHub workflow, tests can run automatically on each push, ensuring continuous integration and delivery. They also showed how to view Playwright reports and traces directly from GitHub Actions.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nYou can also get a report in HTML format, which is automatically generated by Playwright.

It takes a lot of time to prepare and test an application before deploying it.\n \nMicrosoft has luckily come to the rescue and introduced Enterprise App Management! Let's take a closer look at it in this blog and see how it works.\n \nSecurity for Beginners course\nWould you like to expand your knowledge in the security world? I might have found the course for you.\nIt's designed to help you get started with the fundamentals behind security. Take a look at the course right here.\n \nCybersecurity for Beginners\n \n\n \nEnterprise App Management\nThe Enterprise App Catalog is a new app type for Windows devices in Intune. The catalog contains applications based on the Win32 app type that you might have used before for application deployment.\n \nThe catalog contains at this time, 100 prepackaged applications, this number is expanding over time. Some of the apps in the catalog are self-updating, which means that the application will automatically update when the vendor releases a new version. It's not all applications in the catalog that are self-updating.\n \nThe applications that are self-updating have the below message displayed in Intune.\n \n \n\n \n \n \nLicensing for Enterprise App Management\nIf you are thinking about utilizing the Enterprise App Management feature in Intune, you have to be aware of which license you have to use. There are two options available for you.\n \n\nStandalone add-on\n\nThere is an option to buy the Enterprise App Management feature as a standalone add-on if you don't want to use the other features in Intune Suite.\n\n\nIntune Suite\n\nIf you would like to utilize more than the Enterprise App Management feature, you can take a look at the Intune Suite license. It includes features such as endpoint privilege management, advanced analytics, and more!\n\n\n\nIf you are more curious about the options, I would highly recommend you take a look right here.\n \nConfiguration\nOnce you have acquired the license for Enterprise App Management, is it time to take a look at the exciting part - configuration!\n\u00a0\n\nHead into our (at least my) favorite portal of them all, the Intune portal.\nClick on apps, and last but not least, all apps.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n3. Once you are in the apps section, click Add. In the app type section, scroll down to the Enterprise App Catalog app.\u00a0Make sure to click select, once you have clicked on the Enterprise App Catalog app.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n4. As you can see now, we are in the machinery. This is where we can start configuring. Select an app from the catalog, in my case, I will pick 7-Zip.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n5. I will click next and pick the configuration of the app. Once that's done, remember to click select.\nThe options available for configuration can be different from app to app.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHave you tried to deploy apps from Intune before? Remember all the fields that you have to fill out, before the application can be deployed?\nMicrosoft makes sure to pre-populate a lot of the information in the Enterprise App Catalog.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis includes the app and program information, as well as the requirements and detection rules for the application.\nIf you are satisfied with the pre-populated information from Microsoft, you can simply press next through the tabs and deploy the application.\n\u00a0\nBe aware that you can't make the assignments before the application has been created, so this has to be done afterwards.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nConclusion\nThank you for reading through this blog. I hope it gave you some insights on how Enterprise App Management works. In my opinion it makes the deployment of the applications more easier and faster.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMicrosoft Learn\u00a0references\nTake a look below for official documentation for Enterprise App Management.\nMicrosoft Intune Enterprise Application Management\n\u00a0\nDo you want to get started with application management in Intune?
